TREATMENT OF CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION
Documents and information produced by GoDaddy in response to a subpoena may contain confidential, proprietary, trade secret, and/or private information that warrants special protection from public disclosure.
Any such documents will be designated "CONFIDENTIAL" by a stamp affixed to the documents at issue, and must be given confidential treatment by all persons and entities that access them.
Confidential treatment includes the following:
First, access to CONFIDENTIAL documents must be limited to the parties in the underlying action pursuant to which the subpoena was served, their agents, and the court and its personnel.
Documents designated as CONFIDENTIAL may be used during the deposition of a witness in the underlying action to whom disclosure is reasonably necessary, provided that any deposition testimony related to CONFIDENTIAL documents or portions thereof is designated "CONFIDENTIAL" and afforded treatment in the manner required by this provision.
<PARAGRAPH>
Second, CONFIDENTIAL documents must not be filed in the public record absent a reasonable attempt to ensure the filing of such documents, and any references thereto, under seal.
A party that seeks to file any motion, brief, or other document that attaches or refers to any CONFIDENTIAL document or portion thereof must take the steps necessary to request a court order sealing the CONFIDENTIAL information at issue.
If the court denies a motion to seal made pursuant to this Subpoena Policy, the party may file the document(s) at issue normally, unless otherwise instructed by the court.
<PARAGRAPH>
Third, CONFIDENTIAL documents produced in response to a subpoena may not be used for any purpose other than prosecuting or defending the action in which the subpoena is served, and must be destroyed within sixty (60) days after the final disposition of the underlying action.
The person or entity that submits the subpoena is responsible for ensuring that each person or entity to whom any CONFIDENTIAL documents were made available complies with this requirement.
