need personal information to perform a specific job (for example, a customer service representative) are granted access to it.", "All of our employees are kept up to date on our privacy and security practices.", "Due to the existing regulatory environment, we cannot ensure that all of your private communications and other personal information will never be disclosed in ways not otherwise described in this Privacy Policy.", "By way of example, we may be forced to disclose personal information to the government or third parties under certain circumstances or third parties may unlawfully intercept or access transmissions or private communications.", "You need to work to protect against unauthorized access to your passwords and to your computer by signing off once you have finished using a shared computer.", "You are responsible for all actions taken with your User ID and password.", "Therefore we recommend that you do not disclose your password to any third parties.", "If you choose to share your User ID and password or your personal information with third parties, you are responsible for all actions taken with your account and therefore you should review that third party's privacy policy.", "If you lose control of your password, you may lose substantial control over your personal information and may be subject to legally binding actions taken on your behalf such as if someone used your User and ID password to forward libelous material through the Service.", "Therefore, if your password has been compromised for any reason, you should immediately change your password.", "What about Cookies?", "When you visit the Site, we may send one or more \"cookies\" to your computer hard drive through your Web browser.", "A cookie is a small file containing a string

purposes of improving the quality of access to the Site by storing user preferences, and tracking user trends, such as how people use the Site, and their Site access preferences.", "Cookies tell us how and when pages in our Site are visited and by how many people.", "We use cookies to allow you to enter your login information less frequently.", "To the extent IFTTT uses cookies, such cookies do not collect personal information, and we do not combine information collected through cookies with other personal information to tell us who you are or what your username or e-mail address is.", "You are always free to decline our cookies if your browser permits, although in that case you may not be able to use certain features on the Site and you may be required to reenter your password or login information more frequently.", "IFTTT visitors who do not wish to have cookies placed on their computers should set their browsers to refuse cookies before using the Site.", "Most browsers are initially set up to accept cookies, but you can reset your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent.", "We recommend that you leave the cookies activated, however, because deleting cookies may reduce the functionality of IFTTT.", "We do not control the use of cookies by third parties.", "Will IFTTT", "Share Any of the Information it Receives with Other Entities?", "We may use third party service providers to facilitate or outsource one or more aspects of our business and therefore we may provide some of your personal information directly to these service providers.", "These service providers are subject to confidentiality agreements with us and other legal restrictions that prohibit their use of the information we provide them for any other purpose except to facilitate the specific outsourced IFTTT related operation, unless you have given your prior permission to them for additional uses.", "We may share our data, including personal information about you with our partners and joint ventures in furtherance of our business.", "To the extent that these entities have access to your information, they will treat it at least as protectively as they treat information they obtain from their other users.", "Our partners and joint ventures follow privacy practices no less protective of all users than our practices described in this document, to the extent allowed by applicable law.", "In some cases, we may choose to buy or sell assets.", "In these types of transactions, customer information is typically one of the business assets that is transferred.", "Moreover, if IFTTT, or substantially all of its assets, were acquired, or in the unlikely event that IFTTT goes out of business or enters bankruptcy, customer information would be one of the assets that may be transferred to or acquired by a third party.", "You acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and that any acquirer of IFTTT may continue to use your personal information as set forth in this policy.", "IFTTT cooperates with law enforcement inquiries, as well as other third parties to enforce laws and intellectual property rights.", "Therefore, in response to a verified request by law enforcement or other government officials relating to a criminal investigation or alleged illegal activity, we can (and you authorize us to) disclose your name, city, state, telephone number, and email address.", "We will not otherwise disclose your personal information to law enforcement or other government officials without a subpoena, court order or substantially similar legal procedure, except when we believe in good faith that the disclosure of information is necessary to prevent imminent physical harm or financial loss; or report suspected illegal activity.", "This Privacy Policy applies to the IFTTT Service only.", "We do not exercise control over any sites that you may visit from a link on our Site.", "These other sites may place their own cookies or other files on your computer, collect data or solicit personal information from you.", "Since IFTTT does not control the privacy policies of third parties, you are subject to the privacy policies of that third party.", "We encourage you to ask questions before you disclose your personal information to others.", "We may de-identify your Personal Information so that you are not identified as an individual, and provide that information to our partners.", "We may also provide aggregate usage information to our partners (or allow partners to collect that information from you), who may use such information to understand how often and in what ways people use our Services, so that they, too, can provide you with an optimal online experience.", "However, we never disclose aggregate usage or de-identified information to a partner (or allow a partner to collect such information) in a manner that would identify you as an individual person.", "Except as set forth above, you will be notified when your personal information may be shared with third parties, and you will be able to prevent the sharing of this information.", "Accessing, Reviewing and Changing Your Personal Information", "Services can be disconnected at anytime though prior Applets may remain in our electronic archive.", "You can change your email address and contact information by going to the settings page.", "You must promptly update your personal information if it changes or is inaccurate.", "You may be able to add or update certain additional information via the Service.",
