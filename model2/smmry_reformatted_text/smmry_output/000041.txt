All content on Flickr, whether public or private, has to be appropriately moderated using our safety and content filters.

Link back to Flickr when you post your Flickr content elsewhere.

Don't harm children To say that Flickr has a zero tolerance policy towards harmful content involving minors would be an understatement.

Don't host web graphics Flickr is not a place to host generic graphic elements of web page designs, logos, banners, icons, and other non-photographic elements.

Don't use Flickr for commercial activity, unless you're a Flickr Pro.

Only Flickr Pro members are permitted to link directly to a shopping cart, checkout page, or pricing pages on other sites.

Flickr Pros may also list prices for their products in their Flickr photo descriptions.
