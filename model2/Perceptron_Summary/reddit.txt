Reddit powers hundreds of thousands of distinct online communities.
This User Agreement and your conduct make that possible.

Additionally, if you are in the European Economic Area, you must be over the age required by the laws of your country to create an account or otherwise use the Services, or we need to have received verifiable consent from your parent or legal guardian.
If you are accepting these Terms on behalf of another legal entity, including a business or a government, you represent that you have full legal authority to bind such entity to these terms.
Reddit grants you a personal, non-transferable, non-exclusive, revocable, limited license to use and access the Services solely as permitted by these Terms.

Your Reddit Account and Account Security
To use certain features of our Services, you may be required to create a Reddit account (an "Account") and provide us with a username, password, and certain other information about yourself as set forth in the Privacy Policy.
You must maintain the security of your Account and promptly notify Reddit if you discover or suspect that someone has accessed your Account without your permission.
We recommend that you use a strong password that is used only with the Services.
The Services may contain information, text, links, graphics, photos, videos, or other materials (“Content”), including Content created with or submitted to the Services by you or through your Account (“Your Content”).
We take no responsibility for and we do not expressly or implicitly endorse any of Your Content.
Because you alone are responsible for Your Content, you may expose yourself to liability if you post or share Content without all necessary rights.
When Your Content is created with or submitted to the Services, you grant us a worldwide, royalty-free, perpetual, irrevocable, non-exclusive, transferable, and sublicensable license to use, copy, modify, adapt, prepare derivative works from, distribute, perform, and display Your Content and any name, username, voice, or likeness provided in connection with Your Content in all media formats and channels now known or later developed.

You also agree that we may remove metadata associated with Your Content, and you irrevocably waive any claims and assertions of moral rights or attribution with respect to Your Content.
Any ideas, suggestions, and feedback about Reddit or our Services that you provide to us are entirely voluntary, and you agree that Reddit may use such ideas, suggestions, and feedback without compensation or obligation to you.
Although we have no obligation to screen, edit, or monitor Your Content, we may, in our sole discretion, delete or remove Your Content at any time and for any reason, including for a violation of these Terms, a violation of our Content Policy, or if you otherwise create liability for us.
Third-Party Content, Advertisements and Promotions
The Services may contain links to third-party websites, products, or services, which may be posted by advertisers, our affiliates, our partners, or other users (“Third-Party Content”).
Third-Party Content is not under our control, and we are not responsible for any of their websites, products, or services.
Your use of Third-Party Content is at your own risk and you should make any investigation you feel necessary before proceeding with any transaction in connection with such Third-Party Content.
The type, degree, and targeting of advertisements are subject to change, and you acknowledge and agree that we may place advertisements in connection with the display of any Content or information on the Services, including Your Content.
The terms of your promotion must specifically state that the promotion is not sponsored by, endorsed by, or associated with Reddit and the rules for your promotion must require each entrant or participant to release Reddit from any liability related to the promotion.
When accessing or using the Services, you must respect others and their rights, including by following these Terms and the Content Policy, so that we all may continue to use and enjoy the Services.
We support the responsible reporting of security vulnerabilities.

Moderators
Moderating a subreddit is an unofficial, voluntary position that may be available to users of the Services.

We recognize that moderation can take some work, so we may change the features or abilities associated with moderating from time to time without prior notice.
We reserve the right to revoke or limit a user’s ability to moderate at any time and for any reason or no reason, including for a breach of these Terms.
You may not enter into any agreement with a third party on behalf of Reddit, or any subreddits that you moderate, without our written approval;
You may not perform moderation actions in return for any form of compensation or favor from third parties;
If you have access to non-public information as a result of moderating a subreddit, you will use such information only in connection with your performance as a moderator; and
You may create and enforce rules for the subreddits you moderate, provided that such rules do not conflict with these Terms, our Content Policy, and the Moderator Guidelines for Healthy Communities.
Reddit reserves the right, but has no obligation, to overturn any action or decision of a moderator if Reddit believes that such action or decision is not in the interest of Reddit or the Reddit community.
