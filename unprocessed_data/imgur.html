    <h2>Intellectual Property</h2>
    <p>By uploading a file or other content or by making a comment, you represent and warrant to us that (1) doing so
      does not violate or infringe anyone else's rights; and (2) you created the file or other content you are
      uploading, or otherwise have sufficient intellectual property rights to upload the material consistent with these
      terms. With regard to any file or content you upload to the public portions of our site, you grant Imgur a
      non-exclusive, royalty-free, perpetual, irrevocable worldwide license (with sublicense and assignment rights) to
      use, to display online and in any present or future media, to create derivative works of, to allow downloads of,
      and/or distribute any such file or content. To the extent that you delete any such file or content from the public
      portions of our site, the license you grant to Imgur pursuant to the preceding sentence will automatically
      terminate, but will not be revoked with respect to any file or content Imgur has already copied and sublicensed or
      designated for sublicense. Also, of course, anything you post to a public portion of our site may be used by the
      public pursuant to the following paragraph even after you delete it.</p>
    <h2>USE OF IMGUR CONTENT</h2>
    <p>By downloading an image or copying other user-generated content (UGC) from Imgur, you agree that you do not claim
      any rights to it. The following conditions apply:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>You may use UGC for personal, non-commercial purposes.</li>
      <li>You may use UGC for anything that qualifies as fair use under copyright law, for example journalism (news,
        comment, criticism, etc.), but please include an attribute ("Imgur" or "courtesy of Imgur") next to where it is
        displayed.</li>
      <li>You may not use UGC for non-journalistic commercial purposes.</li>
      <li>Your use of UGC is at your own risk. IMGUR MAKES NO WARRANTIES OF NON-INFRINGEMENT, and you will indemnify and
        hold Imgur harmless from any copyright infringement claims arising out of your use of the UGC. (See our general
        disclaimers below.)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>You may not copy or use any portions of our site that are not UGC except within the limits of fair use.</p>
    <h2>NOTICES OF CLAIMED COPYRIGHT INFRINGEMENT (OR OTHER TYPES OF INFRINGEMENT)</h2>
    <p>If you see anything on our site that you believe infringes your copyright rights, you may notify our Digital
      Millennium Copyright Act ("DMCA") agent by sending the following information:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Identification of the copyrighted work or works claimed to have been infringed. IMPORTANT: you must have a
        registered copyright for the work, or at least have filed with the Copyright Office (<a target="_blank"
          href="http://www.copyright.gov/eco/">http://www.copyright.gov/eco/</a>) an application to register a copyright
        for the work. DMCA notifications based on unregistered works are not valid.</li>
      <li>Identification of the material on our servers that is claimed to be infringing and that is to be removed,
        including the URL or other information to enable us to locate the material.</li>
      <li>A statement that you have a good faith belief that use of the material in the manner complained of is not
        authorized by you as copyright owner, or by your agent, or by law.</li>
      <li>A statement that the information in your notice is accurate, and under penalty of perjury, that you are the
        owner (or authorized to act on behalf of the owner) of the exclusive copyright right that is allegedly being
        infringed.</li>
      <li>Your physical or electronic signature, or of someone authorized to act on your behalf.</li>
      <li>Instructions on how we may contact you: preferably email, but also address and phone.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Because a DMCA takedown notice, to be valid, must be based on a work for which the copyright is registered with
      the Copyright Office (or for which registration has been applied for), and because a high percentage of DMCA
      takedown notices are not valid. It will speed our investigation of your DMCA notice if you attach to it a copy of
      your copyright registration, or registration application, for the work.</p>
    <p>Our agent to receive such notifications of claimed infringement is Alan Schaaf.</p>
    <table>
      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td>Email:</td>
          <td><a href="mailto:abuse@imgur.com">abuse@imgur.com</a></td>
        </tr>

    <p>Use the same procedure for any claimed trademark violations or other infringements. If we receive a DMCA takedown
      demand for material you posted that we believe constitutes fair use, we will attempt to notify you if we have your
      contact info; otherwise we are under no obligation to notify you regarding the removal. We reserve the right to
      refuse to remove any material that in our view constitutes fair use. If we identify you as a "repeat infringer,"
      we will block or remove your images and terminate any accounts you have with us. (If we notify you of a DMCA
      removal and you respond with a legitimate counter-notice, that won't count toward being a repeat infringer.) Keep
      in mind that we reserve the right to remove any content at any time whether or not it infringes or violates any of
      our policies.</p>

    <h2>Miscellaneous</h2>
    <p>"Imgur" or "we" refers to Imgur, Inc., a Delaware corporation, and its successors and assigns. "You" refers to
      any person who has consented to these terms or has become contractually bound to them, whether such person is
      identified or not at the time. These terms are governed by California law, excluding its conflicts of law
      principles, and if there is a lawsuit between you and Imgur, jurisdiction and venue will lie exclusively in the
      State where the defendant is located, if within the United States, or in Santa Clara County, California otherwise.
      If any part of these terms is invalid, the remaining provisions will be unaffected. These Terms of Use constitute
      the entire agreement among the parties relating to this subject matter, and they will continue to govern any
      issues that arise out of your use of Imgur's services even after you discontinue using them. We may revise these
      terms from time to time without notice. Whenever we do so, we will so indicate by changing the version date at the
      top. Any changes apply as of the time they are posted. Imgur is not meant for use by children under age 13; if
      your child is younger than 13 please allow him or her to use it only under your supervision. </p>
    <p>Parental control protections (such as computer hardware, software, or filtering services) are commercially
      available that may assist you in limiting access to material that is harmful to minors. See e.g. <a
