        <div class="_3ma" id="u_0_w">Provide a personalized experience for you:</div> Your experience on Facebook is
        unlike anyone else's: from the posts, stories, events, ads, and other content you see in News Feed or our video
        platform to the Pages you follow and other features you might use, such as Trending, Marketplace, and search. We
        use the data we have - for example, about the connections you make, the choices and settings you select, and
        what you share and do on and off our Products - to personalize your experience.

        and connect with people, groups, businesses, organizations, and others that matter to you across the Facebook
        Products you use. We use the data we have to make suggestions for you and others - for example, groups to join,
        events to attend, Pages to follow or send a message to, shows to watch, and people you may want to become
        friends with. Stronger ties make for better communities, and we believe our services are most useful when people
        are connected to people, groups, and organizations they care about.

        There are many ways to express yourself on Facebook and to communicate with friends, family, and others about
        what matters to you - for example, sharing status updates, photos, videos, and stories across the Facebook
        Products you use, sending messages to a friend or several people, creating events or groups, or adding content
        to your profile. We also have developed, and continue to explore, new ways for people to use technology, such as
        augmented reality and 360 video to create and share more expressive and engaging content on Facebook.

        advanced technical systems to detect misuse of our Products, harmful conduct towards others, and situations
        where we may be able to help support or protect our community. If we learn of content or conduct like this, we
        will take appropriate action - for example, offering help, removing content, blocking access to certain
        features, disabling an account, or contacting law enforcement. We share data with other <a
          href="https://www.facebook.com/help/111814505650678?ref=tos">Facebook Companies</a> when we detect misuse or

        systems, and augmented reality - so that people can use our Products safely regardless of physical ability or
        geographic location. For example, technology like this helps people who have visual impairments understand what
        or who is in photos or videos shared on Facebook or Instagram. We also build sophisticated network and
        communication technology to help more people connect to the internet in areas with limited access. And we
        develop automated systems to improve our ability to detect and remove abusive and dangerous activity that may
        harm our community and the integrity of our Products.

            to your own content. You are free to share your content with anyone else, wherever you want. To provide our

            intellectual property rights (like photos or videos) on or in connection with our Products, you grant us a

            your content or account. You should know that, for technical reasons, content you delete may persist for a
            limited period of time in backup copies (though it will not be visible to other users). In addition, content

            have taken on Facebook next to or in connection with ads, offers, and other sponsored content that we

        account has been disabled. <div class="mvm uiP fsm"></div> If you delete or we disable your account, these Terms
        shall terminate as an agreement between you and us, but the following provisions will remain in place: 3,

        <div class="_3ma" id="u_0_1h">3. Limits on liability</div> We work hard to provide the best Products we can and
        to specify clear guidelines for everyone who uses them. Our Products, however, are provided "as is," and we make
        no guarantees that they always will be safe, secure, or error-free, or that they will function without
        disruptions, delays, or imperfections. To the extent permitted by law, we also DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES, WHETHER
        EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE,
        TITLE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT. We do not control or direct what people and others do or say, and we are not
        responsible for their actions or conduct (whether online or offline) or any content they share (including
        offensive, inappropriate, obscene, unlawful, and other objectionable content). <div class="mvm uiP fsm"></div>
        We cannot predict when issues might arise with our Products. Accordingly, our liability shall be limited to the
        fullest extent permitted by applicable law, and under no circumstance will we be liable to you for any lost
        profits, revenues, information, or data, or consequential, special, indirect, exemplary, punitive, or incidental
        damages arising out of or related to these Terms or the Facebook Products, even if we have been advised of the
        possibility of such damages. Our aggregate liability arising out of or relating to these Terms or the Facebook
        Products will not exceed the greater of $100 or the amount you have paid us in the past twelve months.

        <div class="_3ma" id="u_0_1i">4. Disputes</div> We try to provide clear rules so that we can limit or hopefully
        avoid disputes between you and us. If a dispute does arise, however, it's useful to know up front where it can
        be resolved and what laws will apply. <div class="mvm uiP fsm"></div> For any claim, cause of action, or dispute
        you have against us that arises out of or relates to these Terms or the Facebook Products ("claim"), you agree
        that it will be resolved exclusively in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California or a
        state court located in San Mateo County. You also agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of either of
        these courts for the purpose of litigating any such claim, and that the laws of the State of California will
        govern these Terms and any claim, without regard to conflict of law provisions.

        <ol>
          <li>These Terms (formerly known as the Statement of Rights and Responsibilities) make up the entire agreement
            between you and Facebook, Inc. regarding your use of our Products. They supersede any prior agreements.<div
              class="mvm uiP fsm"></div>
          </li>
          <li>Some of the Products we offer are also governed by supplemental terms. If you use any of those Products,
            supplemental terms will be made available and will become part of our agreement with you. For instance, if
            you access or use our Products for commercial or business purposes, such as buying ads, selling products,
            developing apps, managing a group or Page for your business, or using our measurement services, you must
            agree to our <a href="https://www.facebook.com/legal/commercial_terms">Commercial Terms</a>. If you post or
            share content containing music, you must comply with our <a
              href="https://www.facebook.com/legal/music_guidelines">Music Guidelines</a>. To the extent any
            supplemental terms conflict with these Terms, the supplemental terms shall govern to the extent of the
            conflict.<div class="mvm uiP fsm"></div>

          <li>If any portion of these Terms are found to be unenforceable, the remaining portion will remain in full
            force and effect. If we fail to enforce any of these Terms, it will not be considered a waiver. Any
            amendment to or waiver of these Terms must be made in writing and signed by us.<div class="mvm uiP fsm">
            </div>

            consent.</li>
          <li>You may designate a person (called a legacy contact) to manage your account if it is memorialized. Only
            your legacy contact or a person who you have identified in a valid will or similar document expressing clear
            consent to disclose your content upon death or incapacity will be able to seek <a

            operation of law or otherwise.<div class="mvm uiP fsm"></div>

          <li>You should know that we may need to change the username for your account in certain circumstances (for
            example, if someone else claims the username and it appears unrelated to the name you use in everyday life).
            <div class="mvm uiP fsm"></div>
          </li>
          <li>We always appreciate your feedback and other suggestions about our products and services. But you should
