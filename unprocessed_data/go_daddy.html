                      no liability or responsibility for your failure to receive an email notification if such failure

                      acceptance of this Agreement, GoDaddy finds that you do not have the legal authority to bind such
                      corporate entity, you will be personally responsible for the obligations contained in this
                      Agreement, including, but not limited to, the payment obligations. GoDaddy shall not be liable for
                      any loss or damage resulting from GoDaddy’s reliance on any instruction, notice, document or
                      communication reasonably believed by GoDaddy to be genuine and originating from an authorized
                      representative of your corporate entity. If there is reasonable doubt about the authenticity of
                      any such instruction, notice, document or communication, GoDaddy reserves the right (but

                      to a website hosted by GoDaddy or posted to this Site).&nbsp; However, GoDaddy reserves the right
                      (but undertakes no duty) to do so and decide whether any item of User Content is appropriate
                      and/or complies with this Agreement. GoDaddy may remove any item of User Content (whether posted
                      to a website hosted by GoDaddy or posted to this Site) and/or terminate a User’s access to this

                      User is a repeat offender.&nbsp; If GoDaddy terminates your access to this Site or the Services
                      found at this Site, GoDaddy may, in its sole and absolute discretion, remove and destroy any data

                  <p><span style="font-size: medium;">GoDaddy reserves the right to cease offering or providing any of
                      the Services at any time, for any or no reason, and without prior notice. Although GoDaddy makes
                      great effort to maximize the lifespan of all its Services, there are times when a Service we offer
                      will be discontinued or reach its End-of-Life ("EOL"). If that is the case, that product or
                      service will no longer be supported by GoDaddy, in any way, effective on the EOL date.</span></p>

                      will reach EOL, we will attempt to notify you thirty or more days in advance of the EOL date. It
                      is your responsibility to take all necessary steps to replace the Service by migrating to a new
                      Service before the EOL date, or by entirely ceasing reliance on said Service before the EOL date.
                      In either case, GoDaddy will either offer a comparable Service for you to migrate to for the
                      remainder of the term of your purchase, a prorated in-store credit, or a prorated refund, to be
                      determined by GoDaddy in its sole and absolute discretion. GoDaddy may, with or without notice to
                      you, migrate you to the most up-to-date version of the Service, if available. You agree to take
                      full responsibility for any and all loss or damage arising from any such migration.</span></p>

                        automatic renewal automatically renews the applicable Service upon expiration of the then
                        current term for a renewal period equal in time to the most recent service period (except for
                        domain names which may renew for the original service&nbsp;period). For example,&nbsp;if your
                        last service period is for one year, your renewal period will typically be for one
                        year.&nbsp;&nbsp;However,&nbsp;in the&nbsp;event renewal&nbsp;with the Payment Method on file
                        fails,&nbsp;GoDaddy may&nbsp;attempt to renew the applicable service for a period less than the

                        up for renewal and will take payment from any Payment Method you have on file with GoDaddy at
                        GoDaddy’s then current rates, which you acknowledge and agree may be higher or lower than the
                        rates for the original service period.&nbsp; In order to see the renewal settings applicable to
                        you and your Services, simply log into your Account manager&nbsp;from this Site and follow the
                        steps found <a href="http://www.godaddy.com/help/-1042?prog_id=GoDaddy"
                          target="_blank">here</a>.&nbsp; If you do not wish for any Service to automatically renew, you

                        expiration of the then current term, unless you manually renew your Services prior to that date
                        (in which case the Services will again be set to automatic renewal).&nbsp;&nbsp;In other
                        words,&nbsp;should you elect to cancel your product and fail to manually renew your Services
                        before they expire, you may experience an interruption or loss of Services, and GoDaddy shall

                  <p><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="text-transform : uppercase;">In addition, GoDaddy may

                        bank) may notify us of updates to your credit card number and/or expiration date, or they may

                        update to your credit card number and/or expiration date, GoDaddy will automatically update your
                        payment profile on your behalf. GoDaddy makes no guarantees that we will request or receive

                        loss of Services, and GoDaddy shall not be liable to you or any third party regarding the
                        same.</span>&nbsp;</span></p>

                      agree that GoDaddy may pursue all available lawful remedies in order to obtain payment, including
                      but not limited to, immediate cancellation, without notice to you, of any domain names or Services
                      registered or renewed on your behalf. &nbsp;GoDaddy also reserves the right to charge you
                      reasonable “administrative” fees" for (i) tasks GoDaddy may perform outside the normal scope of
                      its Services, (ii) additional time and/or costs GoDaddy may incur in providing its Services,
                      and/or (iii) your noncompliance with this Agreement (as determined by GoDaddy in its sole and
                      absolute discretion). Typical administrative or processing fee scenarios include, but are not
                      limited to (i) customer service issues that require additional personal time or attention; (ii)
                      UDRP actions(s) in connection with your domain name(s) and/or disputes that require accounting or

                  </p>
                  <p><span style="font-size: medium;">GoDaddy&nbsp;offers a variety of alternative international payment
                      options through a variety of International Payment Providers (“IPP”).&nbsp;In the event you select
                      an IPP, you represent that you have already agreed to any and all of the IPP’s applicable customer
                      service agreements in advance of completing your transaction at GoDaddy.&nbsp; You also agree to
                      allow the IPP to debit the full amount of your purchase from the selected account or payment
                      method, collectively “Funding Sources”. In addition, you agree to allow the selected IPP to debit,
                      if applicable, an “Exchange Rate Conversion Fee”, as well as any other fees or charges applicable
                      to your agreement with the IPP (collectively, the “IPP Fees”), from your Funding Sources. You
                      understand and agree that IPP Fees are subject to change at any time by the IPP without notice to
                      you by GoDaddy.</span></p>
                  <p><span style="font-size: medium;">It is your responsibility to keep your Funding Sources current and
                      funded. You agree that (i) the IPP or GoDaddy reserve the right to decline a transaction for any
                      reason and (ii) neither the IPP nor GoDaddy shall be liable to you or any third party regarding
                      the same. You acknowledge that GoDaddy will not attempt to fulfill the Services purchased by you
                      until GoDaddy receives confirmation of payment from the IPP through its associated payment
                      processor. You acknowledge there may be a gap of several hours or days between the time you place
                      an order and the time the IPP confirms payment through its associated payment processor. If
                      GoDaddy does not receive confirmation of payment from the IPP through its associated payment
                      processor within thirty (30) days from when the order is placed, your order may be cancelled, at
                      which time you will need to commence the purchase process again. In the event that you would like
                      to cancel payment for a pending transaction, you may cancel the order through your GoDaddy
                      account. Payments received on previously cancelled orders will be automatically refunded to the
                      original Payment Method when possible.</span></p>
                  <p><span style="font-size: medium;">If, at the time GoDaddy receives confirmation of payment from the
                      IPP (through its associated payment processor), either (i) the Services (including domain names)
                      are no longer available for purchase; or (ii) a pending order has been cancelled in our systems;
                      or (iii) the confirmation of payment does not match the dollar amount of the pending order, and as
                      a result your purchase is either over-funded or under-funded, GoDaddy may automatically issue a
                      partial refund (in the case of over-funding) or a full refund (in the case of under-funding) to
                      your Funding Source. If the IPP (or its associated payment processor) imposes refund limitations
                      of any kind, GoDaddy reserves the right to issue refunds to an in-store credit balance or as a
                      bank transfer, when the payment processor cannot refund back to the Payment Method. &nbsp;If you
                      receive a full refund, you will need to begin the purchase process again.&nbsp;You agree that the
                      IPP reserves the right not to refund IPP Fees associated with a refunded
                      transaction.&nbsp;Accordingly, any refunds issued by GoDaddy will be net of the IPP Fees unless
                      otherwise specified.</span></p>
                  <p><span style="font-size: medium;">GoDaddy&nbsp;offers SEPA Direct Debit (“SEPA”) as a payment method
                      for customers located in Germany. If you choose to use SEPA as a payment method, you are
                      authorizing GoDaddy&nbsp;and Adyen, our payment service provider, to send instructions to your
                      bank to debit your account. By agreeing to these terms you have mandated GoDaddy to collect all of
                      the applicable charges arising under this Agreement. The authorization shall also apply to any new
                      bank account used by you for purchases from GoDaddy. &nbsp;We will notify you of the date of
                      direct debit collection within a reasonable time (the “pre-notification”). This pre-notification
                      will be delivered to you by e-mail at least one (1) business day before payment is collected. You
                      are responsible for making sure that there are sufficient funds in your account to cover any debit
                      payments. You also agree to indemnify GoDaddy&nbsp;against any losses that it may incur if your
                      financial institution withholds payment from GoDaddy&nbsp;for any reason.</span></p>
                  <p><span style="font-size: medium;"><em><strong>(F) IN-STORE CREDIT BALANCES</strong></em></span></p>
                  <p><span style="font-size: medium;">In the event that your Account contains an in-store credit
                      balance: (1) you may apply any available credit balance to any future purchase in your Account;
                      and (2)&nbsp; you authorize GoDaddy to apply any available credit balance to any outstanding
                      administrative fees, chargebacks, or other fees related to your Account.&nbsp;In the event that
                      your default Payment Method fails for an automated billing in connection with the processing of
                      any Service renewals,&nbsp;GoDaddy may use any available in-store credit balance if there are
                      enough funds to cover the entire transaction. Regardless of the amount of in-store credit
                      available in your account,&nbsp;GoDaddy is not responsible for the loss of products resulting from
                      an inability to collect funds from your default Payment Methods or the in-store
                      credit.&nbsp;In-store credits will be applied based on the currency selected in the shopping cart
                      at the time of purchase (or renewal). If you have more than one in-store credit, then the credits
                      will be processed according to the age of the credit, with the oldest in-store credit being
                      applied first. If additional funds are required to complete the purchase or renewal, credits held
                      in a non-selected currency will be converted using GoDaddy’s daily exchange rate based on the age
                      of the credit (oldest to newest) until (i) enough funds are allocated to complete the transaction,
                      or (ii) there is no available balance left in your account. You understand and agree that at the
                      time of conversion, GoDaddy may also impose an additional administrative fee.</span></p>
                  <p><span style="font-size: medium;">You can verify your available in-store credit balance at any time
                      through your Account on the GoDaddy website. You acknowledge that in-store credit balances are
                      non-transferrable,&nbsp;may only be used in the Account in which they were acquired and may
                      expire. Complimentary in-store credits will expire two years after issuance.&nbsp;In the event
                      that GoDaddy terminates your Account, you acknowledge and agree that any remaining available
                      in-store credit balance will be forfeited.&nbsp;</span></p>
                  <p><span style="font-size: medium;">You also acknowledge that funds available in your in-store credit
                      balance will be held by GoDaddy and will not accrue or pay interest for your behalf. To the extent
                      any interest may accrue, you agree that GoDaddy is entitled to receive and keep any such amounts
                      to cover costs associated with supporting the in-store credit balance functionality.</span></p>

                  <p><span style="font-size: medium;">For expired domains names purchased through your account, you
                      agree that you are responsible for payment within forty-eight (48) hours of auction close for the
                      successful bid amount plus the one (1) year renewal or transfer fee (from the end of the domain
                      name’s previous registration period), plus ICANN fee, if applicable, or any valid payment method
                      associated with the account, will be charged on the third day following the auction close. If we
                      are unable to collect payment, you may lose the rights to purchase the domain name.</span></p>

                      arbitrator may award you the same damages as a court sitting in proper jurisdiction, as limited by
                      the Limitation of Liability set forth in Section 15 of this Agreement and may award declaratory or
                      injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent
                      necessary to provide relief warranted by that party’s individual claim. In addition, in some
                      instances, the costs of arbitration could exceed the costs of litigation and the right to
                      discovery may be more limited in arbitration than in court. The decision of the arbitrator shall
                      be final and enforceable by any court with jurisdiction over the parties.</span></p>

                      written statement that sets forth the name, address and contact information of the party giving
                      it, the facts giving rise to the Dispute, and the relief requested (the “Dispute Notice”). The
                      Dispute Notice to GoDaddy must be addressed to: GoDaddy , 14455 N. Hayden Rd., Scottsdale, AZ

                      you.&nbsp; If GoDaddy and you do not reach an agreement to resolve the Dispute within sixty (60)
                      days after the Dispute Notice is received, you or GoDaddy may commence an arbitration proceeding
                      pursuant to this Section. Following submission and receipt of the Dispute Notice, each of us
                      agrees to act in good faith to seek to resolve the Dispute before commencing arbitration.</span>

                      only of individual claims.&nbsp; The AAA Rules are at www.adr.org or by calling 1-800-778-7879. If

                      forth in these Terms shall govern. You may, in arbitration, seek any and all remedies otherwise
                      available to you pursuant to federal, state, or local laws, as limited by the Limitation of
                      Liability set forth in Section 15 of this Agreement. All Disputes shall be resolved by a single
                      neutral arbitrator, and both parties shall have a reasonable opportunity to participate in the
                      selection of the arbitrator. The arbitrator is bound by these Terms. The arbitrator, and not any
                      federal, state or local court or agency, shall have exclusive authority to resolve all disputes
                      arising out of or relating to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability or formation of
                      these Terms, including, but not limited to, any claim that all or any part of these Terms is void
                      or voidable.&nbsp; The arbitrator shall also have exclusive authority to rule on his or her own
                      jurisdiction, including any objections with respect to the existence, scope, or validity of the
                      arbitration agreement or to the arbitrability of any claim or counterclaim.&nbsp; Notwithstanding
                      this broad delegation of authority to the arbitrator, a court may determine the limited question
                      of whether a claim or cause of action is for (i) trade secret misappropriation, (ii) patent
                      infringement, (iii) copyright infringement or misuse, or (iv) trademark infringement or dilution,
                      which are excluded from the definition of “Disputes” as stated above. The arbitrator shall be
                      empowered to grant whatever relief would be available in a court under law or in equity. The
                      arbitrator’s award shall be binding on the parties and may be entered as a judgment in any court
                      of competent jurisdiction. You may choose to engage in arbitration hearings by telephone.
                      Arbitration hearings not conducted by telephone shall take place in a location reasonably
                      accessible from your primary residence (or principal place of business if you are a small
                      business), or in Maricopa County, Arizona, at your option.</span></p>

                      either you or GoDaddy decide to arbitrate a Dispute, we agree to the following procedure:</span>
                  </p>
                  <p><span style="font-size: medium;">i.&nbsp;&nbsp; Write a Demand for Arbitration. The demand must
                      include a description of the Dispute and the amount of damages sought to be recovered. You can
                      find a copy of a Demand for Arbitration at http://www.adr.org (“Demand for Arbitration: Consumer
                      Arbitration Rules”).</span></p>
                  <p><span style="font-size: medium;">ii. &nbsp;Send one copy of the Demand for Arbitration to AAA by
                      mail at American Arbitration Association Case Filing Services 1101 Laurel Oak Road, Suite 100
                      Voorhees, NJ 08043.&nbsp;</span></p>
                  <p><span style="font-size: medium;">iii. Send one copy of the Demand for Arbitration to the other
                      party at the same address as the Dispute Notice, or as otherwise agreed to by the parties.</span>
                  </p>
                  <p><span style="font-size: medium;">(H)&nbsp;<em>Hearing Format.&nbsp;</em>In all hearing formats, the
                      arbitrator shall issue a written decision that explains the essential findings and conclusions on
                      which an award, if any, is based. During the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made
                      by GoDaddy or you shall not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator determines
                      the amount, if any, to which you or GoDaddy is entitled. The discovery or exchange of
                      non-privileged information relevant to the Dispute may be allowed during the arbitration.</span>
                  </p>
                  <p><span style="font-size: medium;">(I)&nbsp;<em>Arbitration Fees and Payments.</em></span></p>
                  <p><span style="font-size: medium;">i. Disputes involving $75,000 or less. GoDaddy will promptly
                      reimburse your filing fees and pay the AAA’s and arbitrator’s fees and expenses. If you reject
                      GoDaddy’s last written settlement offer made before the arbitrator was appointed (“GoDaddy’s last
                      written offer”), your dispute goes all the way to an arbitrator’s decision (called an “award”),
                      and the arbitrator awards you more than GoDaddy’s last written offer, GoDaddy will: (i) pay the
                      greater of the award or $1,000; (ii) pay twice your reasonable attorney’s fees, if any; and (iii)
                      reimburse any expenses (including expert witness fees and costs) that your attorney reasonably
                      accrues for investigating, preparing, and pursuing your claim in arbitration. The arbitrator will
                      determine the amount of fees, costs, and expenses unless you and GoDaddy agree on them.</span></p>
                  <p><span style="font-size: medium;">ii. Disputes involving more than $75,000. The AAA rules will
                      govern payment of filing fees and the AAA’s and arbitrator’s fees and expenses.</span></p>
                  <p><span style="font-size: medium;">iii. Disputes involving any amount. In any arbitration you
                      commence, GoDaddy will seek its AAA or arbitrator’s fees and expenses, or your filing fees it
                      reimbursed, only if the arbitrator finds the arbitration frivolous or brought for an improper
                      purpose. In any arbitration GoDaddy commences, GoDaddy will pay all filing, AAA, and arbitrator’s
                      fees and expenses.&nbsp; GoDaddy will not seek its attorney’s fees or expenses from you in any
                      arbitration.&nbsp; Fees and expenses are not included in determining the amount in dispute.</span>

                      begins when the claim or Notice of Dispute first could be filed.&nbsp; If not filed within one
