<h3 id="the-github-terms-of-service"><a href="#the-github-terms-of-service">The GitHub Terms of Service</a></h3>
<p>Effective date: May 25, 2018</p>
<h3 id="a-definitions"><a href="#a-definitions">A. Definitions</a></h3>
<p><strong>Short version:</strong> <em>We use these basic terms throughout the agreement, and they have specific
    meanings. You should know what we mean when we use each of the terms. There's not going to be a test on it, but
    it's still useful information.</em></p>
<ol>
  <li>The “Agreement” refers, collectively, to all the terms, conditions, notices contained or referenced in this
    document (the “Terms of Service” or the "Terms") and all other operating rules, policies (including the GitHub
    Privacy Statement, available at <a href="https://github.com/site/privacy">github.com/site/privacy</a>) and
    procedures that we may publish from time to time on the Website. Most of our site policies are available at <a
      href="/en/categories/site-policy/">help.github.com/categories/site-policy</a>.</li>
  <li>The “Service” refers to the applications, software, products, and services provided by GitHub.</li>
  <li>The “Website” refers to GitHub’s website located at <a href="https://github.com/">github.com</a>, and all
    content, services, and products provided by GitHub at or through the Website. It also refers to GitHub-owned
    subdomains of github.com, such as <a href="https://education.github.com/">education.github.com</a> and <a
      href="https://pages.github.com/">pages.github.com</a>. These Terms also govern GitHub’s conference websites,
    such as <a href="https://githubuniverse.com/">githubuniverse.com</a>, and product websites, such as <a
      href="https://atom.io/">atom.io</a>. Occasionally, websites owned by GitHub may provide different or additional
    terms of service. If those additional terms conflict with this Agreement, the more specific terms apply to the
    relevant page or service.</li>
  <li>“The User,” “You,” and “Your” refer to the individual person, company, or organization that has visited or is
    using the Website or Service; that accesses or uses any part of the Account; or that directs the use of the
    Account in the performance of its functions. A User must be at least 13 years of age. Special terms may apply for
    business or government Accounts (See <a href="#5-additional-terms">Section B(5): Additional Terms</a>).</li>
  <li>“GitHub,” “We,” and “Us” refer to GitHub, Inc., as well as our affiliates, directors, subsidiaries, contractors,
    licensors, officers, agents, and employees.</li>
  <li>“Content” refers to content featured or displayed through the Website, including without limitation text, data,
    articles, images, photographs, graphics, software, applications, designs, features, and other materials that are
    available on the Website or otherwise available through the Service. "Content" also includes Services.
    “User-Generated Content” is Content, written or otherwise, created or uploaded by our Users. "Your Content" is
    Content that you create or own.</li>
  <li>An "Account" represents your legal relationship with GitHub. A “User Account” represents an individual User’s
    authorization to log in to and use the Service and serves as a User’s identity on GitHub. “Organizations” are
    shared workspaces that may be associated with a single entity or with one or more Users where multiple Users can
    collaborate across many projects at once. A User Account can be a member of any number of Organizations.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="b-account-terms"><a href="#b-account-terms">B. Account Terms</a></h3>
<p><strong>Short version:</strong> <em>User Accounts and Organizations have different administrative controls; a human
    must create your Account; you must be 13 or over; you must provide a valid email address; and you may not have
    more than one free Account. You alone are responsible for your Account and anything that happens while you are
    signed in to or using your Account. You are responsible for keeping your Account secure.</em></p>
<h4 id="1-account-controls"><a href="#1-account-controls">1. Account Controls</a></h4>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Users. Subject to these Terms, you retain ultimate administrative control over your User Account and the
      Content within it.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Organizations. The "owner" of an Organization that was created under these Terms has ultimate administrative
      control over that Organization and the Content within it. Within the Service, an owner can manage User access to
      the Organization’s data and projects. An Organization may have multiple owners, but there must be at least one
      User Account designated as an owner of an Organization. If you are the owner of an Organization under these
      Terms, we consider you responsible for the actions that are performed on or through that Organization.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
<h4 id="2-required-information"><a href="#2-required-information">2. Required Information</a></h4>
<p>You must provide a valid email address in order to complete the signup process. Any other information requested,
  such as your real name, is optional, unless you are accepting these terms on behalf of a legal entity (in which case
  we need more information about the legal entity) or if you opt for a <a href="#l-payment">paid Account</a>, in which
  case additional information will be necessary for billing purposes.</p>
<h4 id="3-account-requirements"><a href="#3-account-requirements">3. Account Requirements</a></h4>
<p>We have a few simple rules for User Accounts on GitHub's Service.</p>
<ul>
  <li>You must be a human to create an Account. Accounts registered by "bots" or other automated methods are not
    permitted. We do permit machine accounts: </li>
  <li>A machine account is an Account set up by an individual human who accepts the Terms on behalf of the Account,
    provides a valid email address, and is responsible for its actions. A machine account is used exclusively for
    performing automated tasks. Multiple users may direct the actions of a machine account, but the owner of the
    Account is ultimately responsible for the machine's actions. You may maintain no more than one free machine
    account in addition to your free User Account.</li>
  <li>One person or legal entity may maintain no more than one free Account (if you choose to control a machine
    account as well, that's fine, but it can only be used for running a machine).</li>
  <li>You must be age 13 or older. While we are thrilled to see brilliant young coders get excited by learning to
    program, we must comply with United States law. GitHub does not target our Service to children under 13, and we do
    not permit any Users under 13 on our Service. If we learn of any User under the age of 13, we will <a
      href="#m-cancellation-and-termination">terminate that User’s Account immediately</a>. If you are a resident of a
    country outside the United States, your country’s minimum age may be older; in such a case, you are responsible
    for complying with your country’s laws.</li>
  <li>Your login may only be used by one person — i.e., a single login may not be shared by multiple people. A paid
    Organization may only provide access to as many User Accounts as your subscription allows.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="4-user-account-security"><a href="#4-user-account-security">4. User Account Security</a></h4>
<p>You are responsible for keeping your Account secure while you use our Service. We offer tools such as two-factor
  authentication to help you maintain your Account's security, but the content of your Account and its security are up
  to you.</p>
<ul>
  <li>You are responsible for all content posted and activity that occurs under your Account (even when content is
    posted by others who have Accounts under your Account).</li>
  <li>You are responsible for maintaining the security of your Account and password. GitHub cannot and will not be
    liable for any loss or damage from your failure to comply with this security obligation.</li>
  <li>You will promptly <a href="https://github.com/contact">notify GitHub</a> if you become aware of any unauthorized
    use of, or access to, our Service through your Account, including any unauthorized use of your password or
    Account.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="5-additional-terms"><a href="#5-additional-terms">5. Additional Terms</a></h4>
<p>In some situations, third parties' terms may apply to your use of GitHub. For example, you may be a member of an
  organization on GitHub with its own terms or license agreements; you may download an application that integrates
  with GitHub; or you may use GitHub to authenticate to another service. Please be aware that while these Terms are
  our full agreement with you, other parties' terms govern their relationships with you.</p>
<p>If you are a government User or otherwise accessing or using any GitHub Service in a government capacity, this <a
    href="/en/articles/amendment-to-github-terms-of-service-applicable-to-u-s-federal-government-users/">Government
    Amendment to GitHub Terms of Service</a> applies to you, and you agree to its provisions.</p>
<p>If you have signed up for GitHub Enterprise Cloud, the <a
    href="/en/articles/github-enterprise-cloud-addendum/">Enterprise Cloud Addendum</a> applies to you, and you agree
  to its provisions.</p>
<h3 id="c-acceptable-use"><a href="#c-acceptable-use">C. Acceptable Use</a></h3>
<p><strong>Short version:</strong> <em>GitHub hosts a wide variety of collaborative projects from all over the world,
    and that collaboration only works when our users are able to work together in good faith. While using the service,
    you must follow this Acceptable Use Policy, which includes some restrictions on content you can post, conduct on
    the service, and other limitations. In short, be excellent to each other.</em></p>
<h4 id="1-compliance-with-laws-and-regulations"><a href="#1-compliance-with-laws-and-regulations">1. Compliance with
    Laws and Regulations</a></h4>
<p>Your use of the Website and Service must not violate any applicable laws, including copyright or trademark laws,
  export control laws, or other laws in your jurisdiction. You are responsible for making sure that your use of the
  Service is in compliance with laws and any applicable regulations.</p>
<h4 id="2-content-restrictions"><a href="#2-content-restrictions">2. Content Restrictions</a></h4>
<p>You agree that you will not under any circumstances upload, post, host, or transmit any content that:</p>
<ul>
  <li>is unlawful or promotes unlawful activities;</li>
  <li>is or contains sexually obscene content;</li>
  <li>is libelous, defamatory, or fraudulent;</li>
  <li>is discriminatory or abusive toward any individual or group;</li>
  <li>contains or installs any active malware or exploits, or uses our platform for exploit delivery (such as part of
    a command and control system); or</li>
  <li>infringes on any proprietary right of any party, including patent, trademark, trade secret, copyright, right of
    publicity, or other rights.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="3-conduct-restrictions"><a href="#3-conduct-restrictions">3. Conduct Restrictions</a></h4>
<p>While using GitHub, you agree that you will not under any circumstances:</p>
<ul>
  <li>harass, abuse, threaten, or incite violence towards any individual or group, including GitHub employees,
    officers, and agents, or other GitHub Users;</li>
  <li>use our servers for any form of excessive automated bulk activity (for example, spamming), or relay any other
    form of unsolicited advertising or solicitation through our servers, such as get-rich-quick schemes;</li>
  <li>attempt to disrupt or tamper with GitHub's servers in ways that could harm our Website or Service, to place
    undue burden on GitHub's servers through automated means, or to access GitHub's Service in ways that exceed your
    authorization (other than those authorized by the <a href="https://bounty.github.com/">GitHub Bug Bounty
      program</a>);</li>
  <li>impersonate any person or entity, including any of our employees or representatives, including through false
    association with GitHub, or by fraudulently misrepresenting your identity or site's purpose; or</li>
  <li>violate the privacy of any third party, such as by posting another person's personal information without
    consent.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="4-services-usage-limits"><a href="#4-services-usage-limits">4. Services Usage Limits</a></h4>
<p>You agree not to reproduce, duplicate, copy, sell, resell or exploit any portion of the Service, use of the
  Service, or access to the Service without GitHub's express written permission.</p>
<h4 id="5-scraping"><a href="#5-scraping">5. Scraping</a></h4>
<p>Scraping refers to extracting data from our Website via an automated process, such as a bot or webcrawler. It does
  not refer to the collection of information through GitHub's API. Please see <a href="#h-api-terms">Section H</a> for
  our API Terms. You may scrape the website for the following reasons:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Researchers may scrape public, non-personal information from GitHub for research purposes, only if any
    publications resulting from that research are open access.</li>
  <li>Archivists may scrape GitHub for public data for archival purposes.</li>
</ul>
<p>You may not scrape GitHub for spamming purposes, including for the purposes of selling GitHub users' personal
  information, such as to recruiters, headhunters, and job boards.</p>
<p>All use of GitHub data gathered through scraping must comply with the <a
    href="https://github.com/site/privacy">GitHub Privacy Statement</a>.</p>
<h4 id="6-privacy"><a href="#6-privacy">6. Privacy</a></h4>
<p>Misuse of GitHub Users' Personal Information is prohibited.</p>
<p>Any person, entity, or service collecting data from GitHub must comply with the <a
    href="https://github.com/site/privacy">GitHub Privacy Statement</a>, particularly in regards to the collection of
  our Users' Personal Information (as defined in the GitHub Privacy Statement). If you collect any GitHub User's
  Personal Information from GitHub, you agree that you will only use the Personal Information you gather for the
  purpose for which our User has authorized it. You agree that you will reasonably secure any Personal Information you
  have gathered from GitHub, and you will respond promptly to complaints, removal requests, and "do not contact"
  requests from GitHub or GitHub Users.</p>
<h4 id="7-excessive-bandwidth-use"><a href="#7-excessive-bandwidth-use">7. Excessive Bandwidth Use</a></h4>
<p>If we determine your bandwidth usage to be significantly excessive in relation to other GitHub customers, we
  reserve the right to suspend your Account or throttle your file hosting until you can reduce your bandwidth
  consumption.</p>
<h4 id="8-user-protection"><a href="#8-user-protection">8. User Protection</a></h4>
<p>You agree not to engage in activity that significantly harms our Users. We will resolve disputes in favor of
  protecting our Users as a whole.</p>
<h3 id="d-user-generated-content"><a href="#d-user-generated-content">D. User-Generated Content</a></h3>
<p><strong>Short version:</strong> <em>You own content you create, but you allow us certain rights to it, so that we
    can display and share the content you post. You still have control over your content, and responsibility for it,
    and the rights you grant us are limited to those we need to provide the service. We have the right to remove
    content or close Accounts if we need to.</em></p>
<h4 id="1-responsibility-for-user-generated-content"><a href="#1-responsibility-for-user-generated-content">1.
    Responsibility for User-Generated Content</a></h4>
<p>You may create or upload User-Generated Content while using the Service. You are solely responsible for the content
  of, and for any harm resulting from, any User-Generated Content that you post, upload, link to or otherwise make
  available via the Service, regardless of the form of that Content. We are not responsible for any public display or
  misuse of your User-Generated Content.</p>
<h4 id="2-github-may-remove-content"><a href="#2-github-may-remove-content">2. GitHub May Remove Content</a></h4>
<p>We do not pre-screen User-Generated Content, but we have the right (though not the obligation) to refuse or remove
  any User-Generated Content that, in our sole discretion, violates any GitHub terms or policies.</p>
<h4 id="3-ownership-of-content-right-to-post-and-license-grants"><a
    href="#3-ownership-of-content-right-to-post-and-license-grants">3. Ownership of Content, Right to Post, and
    License Grants</a></h4>
<p>You retain ownership of and responsibility for Your Content. If you're posting anything you did not create yourself
  or do not own the rights to, you agree that you are responsible for any Content you post; that you will only submit
  Content that you have the right to post; and that you will fully comply with any third party licenses relating to
  Content you post.</p>
<p>Because you retain ownership of and responsibility for Your Content, we need you to grant us — and other GitHub
  Users — certain legal permissions, listed in Sections D.4 — D.7. These license grants apply to Your Content. If you
  upload Content that already comes with a license granting GitHub the permissions we need to run our Service, no
  additional license is required. You understand that you will not receive any payment for any of the rights granted
  in Sections D.4 — D.7. The licenses you grant to us will end when you remove Your Content from our servers, unless
  other Users have forked it.</p>
<h4 id="4-license-grant-to-us"><a href="#4-license-grant-to-us">4. License Grant to Us</a></h4>
<p>We need the legal right to do things like host Your Content, publish it, and share it. You grant us and our legal
  successors the right to store, parse, and display Your Content, and make incidental copies as necessary to render
  the Website and provide the Service. This includes the right to do things like copy it to our database and make
  backups; show it to you and other users; parse it into a search index or otherwise analyze it on our servers; share
  it with other users; and perform it, in case Your Content is something like music or video.</p>
<p>This license does not grant GitHub the right to sell Your Content or otherwise distribute or use it outside of our
  provision of the Service.</p>
<h4 id="5-license-grant-to-other-users"><a href="#5-license-grant-to-other-users">5. License Grant to Other Users</a>
</h4>
<p>Any User-Generated Content you post publicly, including issues, comments, and contributions to other Users'
  repositories, may be viewed by others. By setting your repositories to be viewed publicly, you agree to allow others
  to view and "fork" your repositories (this means that others may make their own copies of Content from your
  repositories in repositories they control).</p>
<p>If you set your pages and repositories to be viewed publicly, you grant each User of GitHub a nonexclusive,
  worldwide license to use, display, and perform Your Content through the GitHub Service and to reproduce Your Content
  solely on GitHub as permitted through GitHub's functionality (for example, through forking). You may grant further
  rights if you <a
    href="/en/articles/adding-a-license-to-a-repository/#including-an-open-source-license-in-your-repository">adopt a
    license</a>. If you are uploading Content you did not create or own, you are responsible for ensuring that the
  Content you upload is licensed under terms that grant these permissions to other GitHub Users.</p>
<h4 id="6-contributions-under-repository-license"><a href="#6-contributions-under-repository-license">6. Contributions
    Under Repository License</a></h4>
<p>Whenever you make a contribution to a repository containing notice of a license, you license your contribution
  under the same terms, and you agree that you have the right to license your contribution under those terms. If you
  have a separate agreement to license your contributions under different terms, such as a contributor license
  agreement, that agreement will supersede.</p>
<p>Isn't this just how it works already? Yep. This is widely accepted as the norm in the open-source community; it's
  commonly referred to by the shorthand "inbound=outbound". We're just making it explicit.</p>
<h4 id="7-moral-rights"><a href="#7-moral-rights">7. Moral Rights</a></h4>
<p>You retain all moral rights to Your Content that you upload, publish, or submit to any part of the Service,
  including the rights of integrity and attribution. However, you waive these rights and agree not to assert them
  against us, to enable us to reasonably exercise the rights granted in Section D.4, but not otherwise.</p>
<p>To the extent this agreement is not enforceable by applicable law, you grant GitHub the rights we need to use Your
  Content without attribution and to make reasonable adaptations of Your Content as necessary to render the Website
  and provide the Service.</p>
<h3 id="e-private-repositories"><a href="#e-private-repositories">E. Private Repositories</a></h3>
<p><strong>Short version:</strong> <em>You may have access to private repositories. We treat the content of private
    repositories as confidential, and we only access it for support reasons, with your consent, or if required to for
    security reasons.</em></p>
<h4 id="1-control-of-private-repositories"><a href="#1-control-of-private-repositories">1. Control of Private
    Repositories.</a></h4>
<p>Some Accounts, such as paid Accounts, may have private repositories, which allow the User to control access to
  Content.</p>
<h4 id="2-confidentiality-of-private-repositories"><a href="#2-confidentiality-of-private-repositories">2.
    Confidentiality of Private Repositories.</a></h4>
<p>GitHub considers the contents of private repositories to be confidential to you. GitHub will protect the contents
  of private repositories from unauthorized use, access, or disclosure in the same manner that we would use to protect
  our own confidential information of a similar nature and in no event with less than a reasonable degree of care.</p>
<h4 id="3-access"><a href="#3-access">3. Access.</a></h4>
<p>GitHub employees may only access the content of your private repositories in the following situations:</p>
<ul>
  <li>With your consent and knowledge, for support reasons. If GitHub accesses a private repository for support
    reasons, we will only do so with the owner’s consent and knowledge.</li>
  <li>When access is required for security reasons, including when access is required to maintain ongoing
    confidentiality, integrity, availability and resilience of GitHub's systems and Service.</li>
</ul>
<p>You may choose to enable additional access to your private repositories. For example:</p>
<ul>
  <li>You may enable various GitHub services or features that require additional rights to Your Content in private
    repositories. These rights may vary depending on the service or feature, but GitHub will continue to treat your
    private repository Content as confidential. If those services or features require rights in addition to those we
    need to provide the GitHub Service, we will provide an explanation of those rights.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="4-exclusions"><a href="#4-exclusions">4. Exclusions.</a></h4>
<p>If we have reason to believe the contents of a private repository are in violation of the law or of these Terms, we
  have the right to access, review, and remove them. Additionally, we may be <a
    href="/en/articles/github-privacy-statement/#how-we-respond-to-compelled-disclosure">compelled by law</a> to
  disclose the contents of your private repositories.</p>
<h3 id="f-copyright-infringement-and-dmca-policy"><a href="#f-copyright-infringement-and-dmca-policy">F. Copyright
    Infringement and DMCA Policy</a></h3>
<p>If you believe that content on our website violates your copyright, please contact us in accordance with our <a
    href="/en/articles/dmca-takedown-policy/">Digital Millennium Copyright Act Policy</a>. If you are a copyright
  owner and you believe that content on GitHub violates your rights, please contact us via <a
    href="https://github.com/contact/dmca">our convenient DMCA form</a> or by emailing copyright@github.com. There may
  be legal consequences for sending a false or frivolous takedown notice. Before sending a takedown request, you must
  consider legal uses such as fair use and licensed uses.</p>
<p>We will terminate the Accounts of <a href="/en/articles/dmca-takedown-policy/#e-repeated-infringement">repeat
    infringers</a> of this policy.</p>
<h3 id="g-intellectual-property-notice"><a href="#g-intellectual-property-notice">G. Intellectual Property Notice</a>
</h3>
<p><strong>Short version:</strong> <em>We own the service and all of our content. In order for you to use our content,
    we give you certain rights to it, but you may only use our content in the way we have allowed.</em></p>
<h4 id="1-githubs-rights-to-content"><a href="#1-githubs-rights-to-content">1. GitHub's Rights to Content</a></h4>
<p>GitHub and our licensors, vendors, agents, and/or our content providers retain ownership of all intellectual

<h4 id="no-abuse-or-overuse-of-the-api"><a href="#no-abuse-or-overuse-of-the-api">No Abuse or Overuse of the API</a>
</h4>
<p>Abuse or excessively frequent requests to GitHub via the API may result in the temporary or permanent suspension of
  your Account's access to the API. GitHub, in our sole discretion, will determine abuse or excessive usage of the
  API. We will make a reasonable attempt to warn you via email prior to suspension.</p>
<p>You may not share API tokens to exceed GitHub's rate limitations.</p>
<p>You may not use the API to download data or Content from GitHub for spamming purposes, including for the purposes
  of selling GitHub users' personal information, such as to recruiters, headhunters, and job boards.</p>
<p>All use of the GitHub API is subject to these Terms of Service and the <a
    href="https://github.com/site/privacy">GitHub Privacy Statement</a>.</p>
<p>GitHub may offer subscription-based access to our API for those Users who require high-throughput access or access
  that would result in resale of GitHub's Service.</p>
<h3 id="i-additional-terms-for-github-pages"><a href="#i-additional-terms-for-github-pages">I. Additional Terms for
    GitHub Pages</a></h3>
<p><strong>Short version:</strong> <em>The GitHub Pages hosting service is subject to certain rules, in addition to
    the rest of the Terms.</em></p>
<p>Each GitHub Account comes with access to the <a href="https://pages.github.com/">GitHub Pages static hosting

  to some specific bandwidth and usage limits, and may not be appropriate for some high-bandwidth uses or other
  prohibited uses. Please see our <a href="/en/articles/what-is-github-pages/">GitHub Pages guidelines</a> for more

<p><strong>Short version:</strong> <em>You need to follow certain rules if you create an application for other Users,
    and there are additional Terms that cover the Marketplace.</em></p>
<h4 id="1-creating-applications"><a href="#1-creating-applications">1. Creating Applications</a></h4>
<p>If you create a third-party application or other developer product that collects User Personal Information or
  User-Generated Content and integrates with the Service through GitHub's API, OAuth mechanism, or otherwise
  ("Developer Product"), and make it available for other Users, then you must comply with the following requirements:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>You must comply with this Agreement and the GitHub Privacy Statement.</li>
  <li>Except as otherwise permitted, such as by law or by a license, you must limit your usage of the User Personal
