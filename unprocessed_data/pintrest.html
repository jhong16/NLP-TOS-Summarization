                  <p>For any dispute you have with Pinterest, you agree to first contact us and try to resolve the
                    dispute with us informally. If we need to contact you, we will do so at the email address on your
                    Pinterest account. If Pinterest hasn’t been able to resolve the dispute with you informally, we each
                    agree to resolve any claim, dispute, or controversy (excluding claims for injunctive or other
                    equitable relief) arising out of or in connection with or relating to these Terms through binding
                    arbitration or (for qualifying claims) in small claims court.</p>
                  <p>Arbitration is a more informal way to resolve our disagreements than a lawsuit in court. For
                    instance, arbitration uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, involves more limited
                    discovery, and is subject to very limited review by courts. Although the process is more informal,
                    arbitrators can award the same damages and relief that a court can award. You agree that, by
                    agreeing to these Terms of Service, the U.S. Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and
                    enforcement of this provision, and that you and Pinterest are each waiving the right to a trial by
                    jury or to participate in a class action. The arbitrator has exclusive authority to resolve any
                    dispute relating to the interpretation, applicability, or enforceability of this binding arbitration
                    agreement. This arbitration provision shall survive termination of this Agreement and the
                    termination of your Pinterest account.</p>
                  <p>Any arbitration will be administered by the American Arbitration Association ("AAA") under the
                    Consumer Arbitration Rules then in effect for the AAA, except as provided herein. You can find their
                    forms at <a href="https://www.adr.org/">www.adr.org</a>. Unless you and Pinterest agree otherwise,
                    the arbitration will be conducted in the county (or parish) where you reside. Each party will be
                    responsible for paying any AAA filing, administrative and arbitrator fees in accordance with AAA
                    Rules, except that Pinterest will pay for your reasonable filing, administrative, and arbitrator
                    fees if your claim for damages does not exceed $75,000 and is non-frivolous (as measured by the
                    standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)). If your claim is for $10,000 or less,
                    we agree that you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of
                    documents submitted to the arbitrator, through a telephonic hearing, or by an in-person hearing as
                    established by the AAA Rules. If your claim exceeds $10,000, the right to a hearing will be
                    determined by the AAA Rules. Regardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the
                    arbitrator shall issue a reasoned written decision explaining the essential findings and conclusions
                    on which the award is based, and any judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered
                    in any court of competent jurisdiction. Nothing in this Section shall prevent either party from
                    seeking injunctive or other equitable relief from the courts, including for matters related to data
                    security, intellectual property or unauthorized access to the Service. ALL CLAIMS MUST BE BROUGHT IN
                    THE PARTIES' INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR
                    REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING, AND, UNLESS WE AGREE OTHERWISE, THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE MORE
                    THAN ONE PERSON'S CLAIMS. YOU AGREE THAT, BY ENTERING INTO THESE TERMS, YOU AND PINTEREST ARE EACH
                    WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION.</p>
                  <p>NOTHING IN THESE TERMS OF SERVICE&nbsp;SHALL AFFECT ANY NON-WAIVABLE STATUTORY RIGHTS THAT APPLY TO
                    YOU. To the extent any claim, dispute or controversy regarding Pinterest or our Service isn’t
                    arbitrable under applicable laws or otherwise: you and Pinterest both agree that any claim or
                    dispute regarding Pinterest will be resolved exclusively in accordance with Section 12 of these
                    Terms.</p>
                  <p>If you're a consumer in the EEA, Section 11 doesn't apply to you.&nbsp;<br>
