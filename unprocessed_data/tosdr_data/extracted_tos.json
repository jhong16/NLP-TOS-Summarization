(\"Academia.edu\" or \"we\") provides this Privacy Policy to inform you of our policies and procedures regarding the collection, use and disclosure of personal information we receive from users of\u00a0academia.edu\u00a0(this \"Site\"). This Privacy Policy applies only to information that you provide to us through this Site. Unless otherwise defined in this Privacy Policy, terms used in this Privacy Policy have the same meanings as in our Terms of Use.\nAs used in this policy, the term \"Processing\" means any operation which is performed upon Personal Information, whether or not by automatic means, such as collection, recording, organization, structuring, storage, adaptation or alteration, retrieval, consultation, use, disclosure by transmission, dissemination or otherwise making available, alignment or combination, restriction, erasure, or destruction.\nInformation Collection and Use by Academia.edu\nOur primary goals in collecting information are to provide and improve our Site, services, features and content, to administer your membership (together, the \u201cAcademia.edu Service\u201d)  and to enable users to enjoy and easily navigate the Site.\nPersonally Identifiable Information\n---When you register with us through the Site to become an Academia.edu Member or when you choose to create your own profile webpage we will ask you for personally identifiable information. This refers to information about you that can be used to contact or identify you (\u201cPersonal Information\u201d). Personal Information may include, but is not limited to, your name, email address, telephone number, home and business postal addresses, age, research interests, gender, education and occupation.

Providing Personal Information and Non-Identifying Information enables you to derive more benefit from the Academia.edu Service by helping you share your research via a profile page, find other academics, opportunities, and information; and helps people and opportunities find you. It also enables us to serve you advertising and other relevant content on and off of the Academia.edu Services. \n---Certain Non-Identifying Information would be considered a part of your Personal Information if it were combined with other identifiers (for example,\u00a0combining your zip code with your street address)\u00a0in a way that enables you to be identified. But the same pieces of information are considered Non-Identifying Information when they are taken alone or combined only with other non-identifying information (for example,\u00a0your viewing preferences). We may combine your Personal Information with Non-Identifying Information and aggregate it with information collected from other Academia.edu Users (defined below) to attempt to provide you with a better experience, to improve the quality and value of the Academia.edu Service and to analyze and understand how our Site and Academia.edu Service are used. We may also use the combined information without aggregating it to serve you specifically, for instance to deliver a product to you according to your preferences or restrictions.\n---We also use your Personal Information to contact you with Academia.edu updates, newsletters, marketing or promotional materials and other information that may be of interest to you. If you decide at any time that you no longer wish to receive such communications from us, please follow the unsubscribe instructions provided in any of the communications or update your \u201cuser preferences\u201d information.

We may retain an archived copy of your records as required by law or for legitimate business purposes.\nAlthough Academia.edu makes good faith efforts to provide individuals with access to their Personal Information, there may be circumstances in which Academia.edu is unable to provide access, including but not limited to: where the information contains legal privilege, would compromise others\u2019 privacy or other legitimate rights, where the burden or expense of providing access would be disproportionate to the risks to the individual\u2019s privacy in the case in question or where it is commercially proprietary. If Academia.edu determines that access should be restricted in any particular instance, we will provide you with an explanation of why that determination has been made and a contact point for any further inquiries. To protect your privacy, Academia.edu will take commercially reasonable steps to verify your identity before granting access to or making any changes to your Personal Information.\nOpt-Out (Right to Object to Processing)\nYou have the right to object to and opt out of certain uses and disclosures of your Personal Information. Where you have consented to Academia.edu's Processing of your Personal Information, you may withdraw that consent at any time and opt out of further Processing by contacting privacy@academia.edu. Even if you opt out, we may still collect and use non-Personal Information regarding your activities on our Sites and/or information from the advertisements on Third Party websites for non-interest based advertising purposes, such as to determine the effectiveness of the advertisements.\nEmail and Telephone Communications\nIf you receive an unwanted email from us, you can use the unsubscribe link found at the bottom of the email to opt out of receiving future emails. We will process your request within a reasonable time after receipt. Note that you will continue to receive transaction-related emails regarding products or services you have requested. We may also send you certain non-promotional communications regarding Academia.edu and our services and you will not be able to opt out of those communications (e.g., communications regarding updates to our Terms or this Privacy Policy).\nWe maintain telephone \"do-not-call\" and \"do-not-mail\" lists as mandated by law. We process requests to be placed on do-not-mail, do-not-phone and do-not-contact lists within 60 days after receipt, or such shorter time as may be required by law.\nData Retention\nAcademia.edu retains the Personal Information we receive as described in this Privacy Policy for as long as you use the Academia.edu Service or as necessary to fulfill the purpose(s) for which it was collected, provide the Academia.edu Service, resolve disputes, establish legal defenses, conduct audits, pursue legitimate business purposes, enforce our agreements, and comply with applicable laws.\nSecurity\nAcademia.edu is very concerned with safeguarding your information. We use reasonable physical, technological, and administrative security measures to protect Member information and attempt to ensure they are applicable under the circumstances. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however, and we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you provide to us. We do not accept liability for unintentional disclosure. Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your Personal Information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.\nWe will make any legally required disclosures of any breach of the security, confidentiality, or integrity of your unencrypted electronically stored \u201cpersonal data\u201d (as defined in applicable state statutes on security breach notification) to you via email or conspicuous posting on this Site in the most expedient time possible and without unreasonable delay, insofar as consistent with (i) the legitimate needs of law enforcement or (ii) any measures necessary to determine the scope of the breach and restore the reasonable integrity of the data system.

We may ask you to supply additional information relevant to your Transaction, including, without limitation, your credit card number, the expiration date of your credit card, your billing address and additional information to verify your identity before completing your Transaction (such information, \u201cPayment Information\u201d). You represent and warrant that you have the legal right to use all payment method(s) represented by any such Payment Information. When you initiate a Transaction, you authorize us to store and continue billing you using your Payment Information and to provide your Payment Information to our third party payment processors as needed to complete your Transactions.  We may also periodically authorize your payment method in anticipation of applicable fees or related charges. Further, as part of our order processing procedures, we may screen orders for fraud or other undesirable activity. If we feel an order could be fraudulent, unauthorized, or illegal, we reserve the right to refuse to process that order. Your Subscription continues until cancelled by you or we terminate your access to or use of the Services or the Subscription in accordance with these Terms.\nIf you elect to purchase an annual or monthly Subscription, you will be charged the annual or monthly Subscription fee (\u201cSubscription Fee\u201d) plus any applicable taxes, at the beginning of your Subscription and each year or month thereafter, respectively, at the then-current rate. If you elect to purchase an annual Subscription, we (or our third party payment processor) will automatically charge you on the anniversary of the commencement of your Subscription using the Payment Information you have provided. If you elect to purchase a monthly Subscription, we (or our third party payment processor) will automatically charge you each month, on the calendar day corresponding to the commencement of your Subscription, using the Payment Information you have provided. In the event your Subscription began on a day not contained in a given month, your payment method will be charged on a day in the applicable month or such other day as we deem appropriate. For example, if you started your Subscription on January 31st, your next payment date is likely to be February 28th, and your payment method would be billed on that date. \nBy agreeing to these Terms and electing to purchase a Subscription, you acknowledge that your Subscription has recurring payment features and you accept responsibility for all recurring payment obligations prior to cancellation of your Subscription by you or Academia.edu.\nFree Trials. We may offer Subscriptions on a free trial basis (\u201cFree Trial\u201d) for a specified period of time. If we offer you a Free Trial, the specific terms of your Free Trial will be provided at signup and/or in the promotional materials describing the Free Trial and your use of the Free Trial is subject to your compliance with such specific terms. Free Trials may not be combined with any other offer. Except as may otherwise be provided in the specific terms for the Free Trial offer, Free Trials are only available to users who have not previously subscribed to the service in connection with which the Free Trial is being offered. When you agree to a Free Trial, you are also agreeing to sign up for a Subscription as described above and, consequently, unless you cancel your Subscription prior to the end of your Free Trial, we (or our third party payment processor) will begin charging your payment method on a recurring basis for the Subscription Fee (plus any applicable taxes) until you cancel your Subscription. Instructions for cancelling your Subscription are stated below in the \u201cCancelling Subscriptions\u201d section. We reserve the right to modify or terminate Free Trials at any time, without notice and in our sole discretion.\nCancelling Subscriptions\nYou may cancel your Subscription at any time.

AFTER THE FIRST THIRTY (30) DAY PERIOD FOLLOWING THE START OF YOUR SUBSCRIPTION YOU WILL NOT RECEIVE A REFUND OF ANY PORTION OF THE SUBSCRIPTION FEE PAID FOR THE THEN CURRENT SUBSCRIPTION PERIOD AT THE TIME OF CANCELLATION. To cancel, you can either (i) email us at support@academia.edu and follow instructions, if any, we provide to you in response to your cancellation request, or (ii) initiate a cancellation through your account settings within the Services. You will be responsible for all Subscription fees incurred for the then current Subscription period. If you cancel, your cancellation will be effective immediately, but Academia.edu will allow you to access the Subscription features until the most recently paid-up Subscription period ends, and then we will terminate your access. Cancelling your Subscription won\u2019t cancel your Account. See the Termination and Account Cancellation section below for information on canceling your Account.\nPlease be aware that any fee or subscription plan is exclusive of all taxes.

Any other trademarks, service marks, logos, trade names and any other proprietary designations are the trademarks or registered trademarks of their respective parties.\nControlling Law\nThese Terms and any action related thereto will be governed by the laws of the State of California without regard to its conflict of laws provisions.\nEntire Agreement\nThese Terms constitute the entire and exclusive understanding and agreement between Academia.edu and you regarding the Site, Services and Collective Content, and these Terms supersede and replace any and all prior oral or written understandings or agreements between Academia.edu and you regarding the Site, Services and Collective Content.\nAssignment\nYou may not assign or transfer these Terms, by operation of law or otherwise, without Academia.edu\u2019s prior written consent.  Any attempt by you to assign or transfer these Terms, without such consent, will be null and of no effect.  Academia.edu may assign or transfer these Terms, at its sole discretion, without restriction.  Subject to the foregoing, these Terms will bind and inure to the benefit of the parties, their successors and permitted assigns.\nNotices\nAny notices or other communications permitted or required hereunder, including those regarding modifications to these Terms, will be in writing and given by Academia.edu (i) via email (in each case to the address that you provide); or (ii) by posting to the Site.  For notices made by e-mail, the date of receipt will be deemed the date on which such notice is transmitted.\nDispute Resolution\nYou and Academia.edu agree that any dispute, claim or controversy arising out of or relating to these Terms or the breach, termination, enforcement, interpretation or validity thereof or the use of the Site or Services (collectively, \u201cDisputes\u201d) will be settled by binding arbitration, except that each party retains the right: (i) to bring an individual action in small claims court and (ii) to seek injunctive or other equitable relief in a court of competent jurisdiction to prevent the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation or violation of a party\u2019s copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, patents or other intellectual property rights (the action described in the foregoing clause (ii), an \u201cIP Protection Action\u201d). (The actions described in clauses (i) and (ii) are the \u201cLitigable Actions.\u201d). Without limiting the preceding sentence, you will also have the right to litigate any Dispute other than a Litigable Action, if you provide Academia.edu with written notice of your desire to do so by email or regular mail at 580 California St, Suite 400, San Francisco, CA, 94104 within thirty (30) days following the date you first agree to these Terms (such notice, an \u201cArbitration Opt-out Notice\u201d). If you don\u2019t provide Academia.edu with an Arbitration Opt-out Notice within the thirty (30) day period, you will be deemed to have knowingly and intentionally waived your right to litigate any Dispute except for Litigable Actions. The exclusive jurisdiction and venue of any IP Protection Action or, if you timely provide Academia.edu with an Arbitration Opt-out Notice, any Dispute other than an individual action brought in small claims court, will be the state and federal courts located in the Northern District of California and each of the parties hereto waives any objection to jurisdiction and venue in such courts.\u00a0Unless you timely provide CIR with an Arbitration Opt-out Notice, you acknowledge and agree that you and Academia.edu are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class action or representative proceeding.\u00a0Further, unless both you and Academia.edu otherwise agree in writing, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person's claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of any class or representative proceeding. If this specific paragraph is held unenforceable, then the entirety of this \u201cDispute Resolution\u201d section will be deemed void. Except as provided in the preceding sentence, this \u201cDispute Resolution\u201d section will survive any termination of these Terms.\nArbitration Rules and Governing Law.  The arbitration will be administered by the American Arbitration Association (\u201cAAA\u201d) in accordance with the Commercial Arbitration Rules and the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (the \u201cAAA Rules\u201d) then in effect, except as modified by this \u201cDispute Resolution\u201d section.  (The AAA Rules are available at www.adr.org/arb_med or by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879.)  The Federal Arbitration Act will govern the interpretation and enforcement of this Section.\nArbitration Process.  A party who desires to initiate arbitration must provide the other party with a written Demand for Arbitration as specified in the AAA Rules.  (The AAA provides a form Demand for Arbitration at http://www.adr.org/aaa/ShowPDF?doc=ADRSTG_004175 and a separate form for California residents at http://www.adr.org/aaa/ShowPDF?doc=ADRSTG_015822.)  The arbitrator will be either a retired judge or an attorney licensed to practice law and will be selected by the parties from the AAA\u2019s roster of arbitrators.  If the parties are unable to agree upon an arbitrator within seven (7) days of delivery of the Demand for Arbitration, then the AAA will appoint the arbitrator in accordance with the AAA Rules.\nArbitration Location and Procedure.  Unless you and Academia.edu otherwise agree, the arbitration will be conducted in the county where you reside.  If your claim does not exceed $10,000, then the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of the documents that you and Academia.edu submit to the arbitrator, unless you request a hearing or the arbitrator determines that a hearing is necessary.  If your claim exceeds $10,000, your right to a hearing will be determined by the AAA Rules.  Subject to the AAA Rules, the arbitrator will have the discretion to direct a reasonable exchange of information by the parties, consistent with the expedited nature of the arbitration.\nArbitrator\u2019s Decision.  The arbitrator will render an award within the time frame specified in the AAA Rules.  The arbitrator\u2019s decision will include the essential findings and conclusions upon which the arbitrator based the award.  Judgment on the arbitration award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof.  The arbitrator\u2019s award damages must be consistent with the terms of the \u201cLimitation of Liability\u201d section above as to the types and the amounts of damages for which a party may be held liable.  The arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the claimant and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by the claimant\u2019s individual claim.  If you prevail in arbitration you will be entitled to an award of attorneys\u2019 fees and expenses, to the extent provided under applicable law.  Academia.edu will not seek, and hereby waives all rights it may have under applicable law to recover, attorneys\u2019 fees and expenses if it prevails in arbitration.\nFees.  Your responsibility to pay any AAA filing, administrative and arbitrator fees will be solely as set forth in the AAA Rules.  However, if your claim for damages does not exceed $75,000, Academia.edu will pay all such fees unless the arbitrator finds that either the substance of your claim or the relief sought in your Demand for Arbitration was frivolous or was brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)).\nChanges.  Notwithstanding the provisions of the \u201cModification\u201d section above, if Academia.edu changes this \u201cDispute Resolution\u201d section after the date you first accepted these Terms (or accepted any subsequent changes to these Terms), you may reject any such change by sending us written notice (including by email to feedback@academia.edu) within 30 days of the date such change became effective, as indicated in the \u201cLast Updated Date\u201d above or in the date of Academia.edu\u2019s email to you notifying you of such change.  By rejecting any change, you are agreeing that you will arbitrate any Dispute between you and Academia.edu in accordance with the provisions of this \u201cDispute Resolution\u201d section as of the date you first accepted these Terms (or accepted any subsequent changes to these Terms).\nGeneral\nThe failure of Academia.edu to enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not constitute a waiver of future enforcement of that right or provision. The waiver of any such right or provision will be effective only if in writing and signed by a duly authorized representative of Academia.edu. Except as expressly set forth in these Terms, the exercise by either party of any of its remedies under these Terms will be without prejudice to its other remedies under these Terms or otherwise. If for any reason a court of competent jurisdiction finds any provision of these Terms invalid or unenforceable, that provision will be enforced to the maximum extent permissible and the other provisions of these Terms will remain in full force and effect.\nContacting Academia.edu\nIf you have any questions about these Terms, please contact Academia.edu at feedback@academia.edu.\n\u00d7CloseLog InLog In\u00a0with\u00a0FacebookLog In\u00a0with\u00a0GoogleorEmail:Password:Remember me on this computeror\u00a0reset passwordEnter the email address you signed up with and we'll email you a reset link.\n"}, "airbnb.com": {"https://www.airbnb.com/terms": "\nAccess Denied\n \nYou don't have permission to access \"http://www.airbnb.com/terms\" on this server.\nReference #18.56bf1cb8.1555601923.b834893\n"}, "allrecipes.com": {"http://www.meredith.com/legal/privacy": "\nMeredith Privacy Policy | Meredith\n \n \n \n---To read our EU privacy policy click here---To read our detailed privacy policy click here---To opt-out of many third-party tracking technologies for interest-based advertising, follow the instructions here---To opt-out of precise location tracking of your mobile device, follow the instructions here---To opt-out of promotions sent by mail from third parties, click here.---To opt-out of promotions sent by mail from Meredith Corporation, click here.---To update or correct your information with Meredith, click here\u00a0---We\u2019ve updated our description of how our service providers and provider partners may collect information directly from you to support services they perform for us and services or features they provide to our users through our sites.\u00a0Please read this summary and our updated privacy policy carefully so you understand what types of information Meredith collects about you, how we use and share that information and your related choices.\u00a0(As provided by California Civil Code Section 1798.83)California residents have the right to request and obtain from us, once a year and free of charge, a list of the third parties to whom we have disclosed certain types of personal information (if any) for their direct marketing purposes in the prior calendar year.

Third-party companies that provide some of the tools and features accessible through our Services and advertisers and other companies involved in the delivery of advertisements you see on our Services and other websites also may use tracking technologies to collect information about your use of our Services.\u00a0Cookies are small amounts of data (often containing a unique identifier) that are stored in separate files within your computer or device\u2019s Internet browser. Cookies are accessed and recorded by the websites you visit, and by the companies that deliver the advertisements you see on our services, so they can recognize the same browser navigating online. You can set your browser to accept or reject most cookies, or to notify you when a cookie is set. (Each browser is different, so check the \"Help\" menu of your browser to learn how to change your cookie preferences.) It is up to you to decide whether to allow us or third parties to set cookies, but if you block cookies, you may not be able to view or access some of the features of our Services.

For information about how to delete Flash cookies, please visit the Adobe website here.\u00a0Web beacons (sometimes called \"transparent GIFs,\" \"clear GIFs,\" or \"pixel tags\") are small strings of code that embed a small graphic image (usually invisible) on a web page or in an email or advertisement. When your browser downloads a web beacon, the server that sends the corresponding image to your browser can recognize and store certain types of information such as cookies previously set, the time and date that you viewed the page embedded with the beacon and a description of that page.\u00a0Certain mobile devices, including smart phones and tablet devices, contain unique device IDs that can be used to identify their physical location. Some mobile device IDs are persistent, while others may be resettable by accessing the device\u2019s privacy settings. Mobile devices also typically transmit caller ID data (which may include a phone number) when used to transmit a telephone call or text message. When you use mobile devices to access our Services, we may collect and transmit unique device IDs and collect caller ID data, as well as other information about your device, including without limitation, your wireless carrier, the make, model, operating system, capacity and settings of your device, the names, package IDs and versions of other software you have downloaded to your device and information about how you interact with and navigate within our Service. With your consent, we or our authorized service providers and partners also may use precise geolocation technology such as GPS or Wi-Fi triangulation or mobile Bluetooth beacon technology to collect information about the exact location of your mobile device. Precise location information may be collected both while you are using one of our mobile applications and continuously over time while our apps are not in use but are running in the background of your device. This information may be used for the purposes described below in \"How We Use The Information We Collect,\" including to tailor special offers and advertising to your interests, both in our Services, and in third-party marketing channels.

When you visit a page that includes one of these sharing tools, the third-party company that operates the tool may be collecting information about your browser, device and online activity through its own tracking technologies and subject to its own separate privacy policy, which may differ from ours.\u00a0Some of our advertisers may participate in a program operated by the Nielsen Company to develop an Online Campaign Ratings service that is comparable to Nielsen's television ratings. When one of their ads appears on our Services, it may contain a web beacon that will record your exposure to the ad, read certain cookies on your browser, and forward this information to one or more operators of third-party websites or other online service on which you may have registered. If the third-party operator recognizes a cookie that identifies you as one of its registered users, it will append the impression data it receives, which may identify you as a user our Services, with age and gender information before returning the data to Nielsen. Nielsen aggregates the data it receives about a given campaign to create ratings reports for advertisers and publishers. According to Nielsen, these reports measure campaign performance on an aggregate level within various demographic categories and do not identify you personally.

The following describes some of the circumstances in which we may share information about our users:\u00a0We share our users' email addresses with service providers that send email messages and deliver targeted advertising on our behalf. These service providers may collect data about how you interact with those messages (including information about whether and when you opened a particular message or clicked on a link within a message and the device you used to do so) and analyze it in conjunction with similar information they collect when you respond to emails they send on behalf of their other clients who are not affiliated with us. They use this email response information in combination with your email address to target and optimize the delivery of emails and email advertising they send on our behalf and for their other clients. We may also provide our service providers with lists of our user email addresses in a hashed, encrypted or anonymized form that they use to recognize our users as they navigate online or use third-party email services and enable the delivery of interest-based advertising to those users. We do not authorize our service providers to share your email address with their other clients.If you use our Services to sign up for special email offers from third-party advertisers, we will also share your email address and any other information you provided with your request with the advertisers you selected. Except as described in this policy, we will not sell or rent your email address to unaffiliated third parties for their email marketing purposes, without your consent.\u00a0If, during or immediately following registration, you choose to access offers for goods or services that are available from selected third-party companies (\u201cCo-Registration Vendors\u201d), we may make certain contact and demographic information you provide (e.g., name, age, and/or email address) available to these vendors with your consent.\u00a0To make your experience with our Services more useful and enjoyable, we may offer some features (such as social sharing tools and chat rooms) in conjunction with third-party providers (\"Provider Partners\") that specialize in operating such services.

IF SUCCESSFUL ON SUCH CLAIMS, YOU COULD BE AWARDED MONEY OR OTHER RELIEF BY AN ARBITRATOR. YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT YOU HAVE BEEN ADVISED THAT YOU MAY CONSULT WITH AN ATTORNEY IN DECIDING WHETHER TO ACCEPT THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT.15.2 Arbitration Rules and Forum. The Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this Arbitration Agreement. To begin an arbitration proceeding, you must send a letter requesting arbitration and describing your claim to John Zieser, General Counsel, Meredith Corporation, 1716 Locust Street, Des Moines, IA 50309. The arbitration will be conducted by JAMS, an established alternative dispute resolution provider. Disputes involving claims and counterclaims with an amount in controversy under $250,000, not inclusive of attorneys' fees and interest, shall be subject to JAMS' most current version of the Streamlined Arbitration Rules and procedures available at http://www.jamsadr.com/rules-streamlined-arbitration/; all other claims shall be subject to JAMS's most current version of the Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and Procedures, available at http://www.jamsadr.com/rules-comprehensive-arbitration/. JAMS's rules are also available at www.jamsadr.comor by calling JAMS at 800-352-5267. If JAMS is not available to arbitrate, the parties will select an alternative arbitral forum. If the arbitrator finds that you cannot afford to pay JAMS's filing, administrative, hearing and/or other fees and you cannot obtain a waiver from JAMS, Meredith will pay them for you. In addition, Meredith will reimburse all such JAMS' filing, administrative, hearing and/or other fees for claims with an amount in controversy totaling less than $10,000 unless the arbitrator determines the claims are frivolous.You may choose to have the arbitration conducted by telephone, based on written submissions, or in person in the county where you live or at another mutually agreed location. Any judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.15.3 Authority of Arbitrator. The arbitrator, and not any federal, state or local court or agency shall have exclusive authority to resolve any dispute related to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability or formation of this Arbitration Agreement including, but not limited to any claim that all or any part of this Arbitration Agreement is void or voidable. The arbitrator will decide the rights and liabilities, if any, of you and Meredith. The arbitration proceeding will not be consolidated with any other matters or joined with any other proceedings or parties. The arbitrator shall have the authority to grant motions dispositive of all or part of any claim or dispute. The arbitrator shall have the authority to award monetary damages and to grant any non-monetary remedy or relief available to an individual under applicable law, the arbitral forum's rules, and this Agreement (including the Arbitration Agreement). The arbitrator shall issue a written award and statement of decision describing the essential findings and conclusions on which any award (or decision not to render an award) is based, including the calculation of any damages awarded. The arbitrator shall follow the applicable law. The arbitrator has the same authority to award relief on an individual basis that a judge in a court of law would have. The award of the arbitrator is final and binding upon you and us.15.4 Waiver of Jury Trial. YOU AND MEREDITH HEREBY WAIVE ANY CONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY RIGHTS TO SUE IN COURT (OTHER THAN SMALL CLAIMS COURT AS PERMITTED HEREIN) AND HAVE A TRIAL IN FRONT OF A JUDGE OR A JURY. You and Meredith are instead electing that all covered claims and disputes shall be resolved by arbitration under this Arbitration Agreement, except as specified in section 15.1 above. An arbitrator can award on an individual basis the same damages and relief as a court and must follow this Agreement as a court would. However, there is no judge or jury in arbitration, and court review of an arbitration award is subject to very limited review.15.5 Waiver of Class or Consolidated Actions. ALL CLAIMS AND DISPUTES WITHIN THE SCOPE OF THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT MUST BE ARBITRATED ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT ON A CLASS, COLLECTIVE OR REPRESENTATIVE BASIS. ONLY INDIVIDUAL RELIEF IS AVAILABLE FOR CLAIMS COVERED BY THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT, AND CLAIMS OF MORE THAN ONE CUSTOMER OR USER CANNOT BE ARBITRATED OR CONSOLIDATED WITH THOSE OF ANY OTHER CUSTOMER OR USER. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, in the event that this section 15.5 is deemed invalid or unenforceable with respect to a particular claim or dispute, neither you nor we shall be entitled to arbitration of such claim or dispute and instead the applicable claim or dispute shall be resolved in a court as set forth in section 16.5.15.6 30-Day Right to Opt Out. You have the right to opt out of the provisions of this Arbitration Agreement by sending a timely written notice of your decision to opt out to the following address: Meredith Corporation, 1716 Locust Street, Des Moines, IA 50309-3023, Attn: General Counsel or email to arbitrationoptout@meredith.com, within 30 days after first becoming subject to this Arbitration Agreement. Your notice must include your name and address, your Meredith username (if any), the email address you used to set up your Meredith account (if you have one), and a clear statement that you want to opt out of this Arbitration Agreement. If you opt out of this Arbitration Agreement, all other parts of this Agreement will continue to apply to you. Opting out of this Arbitration Agreement has no effect on any other arbitration agreements that you may currently have with us, or may enter into in the future with us.15.7 Severability. Subject to section 15.5, if any part or parts of this Arbitration Agreement are found under the law to be invalid or unenforceable, then such specific part or parts shall be of no force and effect and shall be severed and the remainder of the Arbitration Agreement shall continue in full force and effect.15.8 Survival of Agreement. This Arbitration Agreement will survive the termination or expiration of the Agreement or your relationship with Meredith.15.9 Modification. Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the contrary, we agree that if Meredith makes any future material change to this Arbitration Agreement, it will not apply to any individual claim(s) of which you had already provided notice to Meredith.16. General Provisions.16.1 Electronic Communications. The communications between you and Meredith use electronic means, whether you visit the Services or send Meredith e-mails, or whether Meredith posts notices on the Services or communicates with you via e-mail. For contractual purposes, you (1) consent to receive communications from Meredith in an electronic form; and (2) agree that all terms and conditions, agreements, notices, disclosures, and other communications and documents that Meredith provides to you electronically will have the same legal effect that such communications or documents would have if they were set forth in \"writing.\" The foregoing sentence does not affect your statutory rights.16.2 Assignment. This Agreement, and your rights and obligations hereunder, may not be assigned, subcontracted, delegated or otherwise transferred by you without Meredith's prior written consent, and any attempted assignment, subcontract, delegation, or transfer in violation of the foregoing will be null and void.16.3 Force Majeure. Meredith shall not be liable for any delay or failure to perform resulting from causes outside its reasonable control, including, but not limited to, acts of God, war, terrorism, riots, embargos, acts of civil or military authorities, fire, floods, accidents, strikes or shortages of transportation facilities, fuel, energy, labor or materials.16.4 Questions, Complaints, Claims. If you have any questions, complaints or claims with respect to the Services, please contact our customer service department using the contact information available on the Services. We will do our best to address your concerns.16.5 Exclusive Venue. To the extent the parties are permitted under this Agreement to initiate litigation in a court, both you and Meredith agree that all claims and disputes arising out of or relating to this Agreement will be litigated exclusively in the state courts in Polk County, Iowa or federal courts located in the Southern District of Iowa.16.6 Governing Law. THIS AGREEMENT AND ANY ACTION RELATED THERETO WILL BE GOVERNED AND INTERPRETED BY AND UNDER THE LAWS OF THE STATE OFIOWA, CONSISTENT WITH THE FEDERAL ARBITRATION ACT, WITHOUT GIVING EFFECT TO ANY CONFLICT OF LAW OR OTHER PRINCIPLES THAT PROVIDE FOR THE APPLICATION OF THE LAW OF ANOTHER JURISDICTION. THE UNITED NATIONS CONVENTION ON CONTRACTS FOR THE INTERNATIONAL SALE OF GOODS DOES NOT APPLY TO THIS AGREEMENT.16.7 Notice. Where Meredith requires that you provide an e-mail address, you are responsible for providing Meredith with your most current e-mail address. In the event that the last e-mail address you provided to Meredith is not valid, or for any reason is not capable of delivering to you any notices required/ permitted by this Agreement, Meredith's dispatch of the e-mail containing such notice will nonetheless constitute effective notice. You may give notice to Meredith at the following address: Meredith Corporation, 1716 Locust Street, Des Moines, IA 50309-3023, Attn: General Counsel. Such notice shall be deemed given when received by Meredith by letter delivered by nationally recognized overnight delivery service or first class postage prepaid mail at the above address.16.8 Waiver. Any waiver or failure to enforce any provision of this Agreement on one occasion will not be deemed a waiver of any other provision or of such provision on any other occasion.16.9 Severability. Subject to Section 15.5, if any portion of this Agreement is held invalid or unenforceable, that portion shall be construed in a manner to reflect, as nearly as possible, the original intention of the parties, and the remaining portions shall remain in full force and effect.16.10 Export Control. You may not use, export, import, or transfer the Services except as authorized by U.S. law, the laws of the jurisdiction in which you obtained the Services, and any other applicable laws. In particular, but without limitation, the Services may not be exported or re-exported (a) into any United States embargoed countries, or (b) to anyone on the U.S. Treasury Department's list of Specially Designated Nationals or the U.S. Department of Commerce's Denied Person's List or Entity List. By using the Services, you represent and warrant that (i) you are not located in a country that is subject to a U.S. Government embargo, or that has been designated by the U.S. Government as a \"terrorist supporting\" country and (ii) you are not listed on any U.S. Government list of prohibited or restricted parties. You also will not use the Services for any purpose prohibited by U.S. law.16.11 Consumer Complaints. In accordance with California Civil Code \u00a71789.3, you may report complaints to the Complaint Assistance Unit of the Division of Consumer Services of the California Department of Consumer Affairs by contacting them in writing at 400 R Street, Sacramento, CA 95814, or by telephone at (800) 952-5210.16.12 Entire Agreement.

to such subject matter. \n \n \n \n \n"}, "amazon.com": {"https://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=201809740": "\nAmazon.com Help: Alexa Terms of Use\n= t) {\n          if(typeof P

Please take a moment to familiarize yourself with our privacy practices and contact us if you have any questions.\n\u00a0\nYour California Privacy Disclosures\u00a0\nInformation Regarding Commercial Electronic Messages in Canada\nPersonal information is data that can be used to identify or contact a single person.You may be asked to provide your personal information anytime you are in contact with Apple or an Apple affiliated company. Apple and its affiliates may share this personal information with each other and use it consistent with this Privacy Policy. They may also combine it with other information to provide and improve our products, services, content, and advertising. You are not required to provide the personal information that we have requested, but, if you chose not to do so, in many cases we will not be able to provide you with our products or services or respond to any queries you may have.Here are some examples of the types of personal information Apple may collect and how we may use it:---When you create an Apple ID, apply for commercial credit, purchase a product, download a software update, register for a class at an Apple Retail Store, connect to our services, contact us including by social media or participate in an online survey, we may collect a variety of information, including your name, mailing address, phone number, email address, contact preferences, device identifiers, IP address, location information, credit card information and profile information where the contact is via social media.---When you share your content with family and friends using Apple products, send gift certificates and products, or invite others to participate in Apple services or forums, Apple may collect the information you provide about those people such as name, mailing address, email address, and phone number. Apple will use such information to fulfill your requests, provide the relevant product or service, or for anti-fraud purposes.---In certain jurisdictions, we may ask for a government issued ID in limited circumstances including when setting up a wireless account and activating your device, for the purpose of extending commercial credit, managing reservations, or as required by law.We may process your personal information: for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy, with your consent, for compliance with a legal obligation to which Apple is subject or when we have assessed it is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by Apple or a third party to whom it may be necessary to disclose information.---The personal information we collect allows us to keep you posted on Apple\u2019s latest product announcements, software updates, and upcoming events. If you don\u2019t want to be on our mailing list, you can opt-out anytime by updating your preferences.---We also use personal information to help us create, develop, operate, deliver, and improve our products, services, content and advertising, and for loss prevention and anti-fraud purposes. We may also use your personal information for account and network security purposes, including in order to protect our services for the benefit of all our users. Where we use your information for anti-fraud purposes it arises from the conduct of an online transaction with us. We limit our uses of data for anti-fraud purposes to those which are strictly necessary and within our assessed legitimate interests to protect our customers and our services. For certain online transactions we may also validate the information provided by you with publicly accessible sources.---We may use your personal information, including date of birth, to verify identity, assist with identification of users, and to determine appropriate services. For example, we may use date of birth to determine the age of Apple ID account holders.---From time to time, we may use your personal information to send important notices, such as communications about purchases and changes to our terms, conditions, and policies. Because this information is important to your interaction with Apple, you may not opt out of receiving these communications.---We may also use personal information for internal purposes such as auditing, data analysis, and research to improve Apple\u2019s products, services, and customer communications.---If you enter into a sweepstake, contest, or similar promotion we may use the information you provide to administer those programs.---If you apply for a position at Apple or we receive your information in connection with a potential role at Apple, we may use your information to evaluate your candidacy and to contact you. If you are a candidate, you will receive more information about how Apple handles candidate personal information at the time of application.We may have received your personal information from other persons if that person has shared their content with you using Apple products, sent gift certificates and products, or invited you to participate in Apple services or forums. We may also validate the information provided by you when creating an Apple ID with a third party for security and fraud prevention purposes.If you are a potential candidate for employment with Apple, we may have received your personal information from third parties such as recruiters or external websites. We will use the personal information we receive to contact you about a potential opportunity or in evaluating your candidacy. If you did not provide us your personal information directly, we will inform you of the source when we first contact you regarding your candidacy.For research and development purposes, we may use datasets such as those that contain images, voices or other data that could be associated with an identifiable person. When acquiring such datasets, we do so in accordance with applicable law in the jurisdiction in which the dataset is hosted. When using such datasets for research and development, we do not attempt to re-identify individuals who may appear therein.We also collect data in a form that does not, on its own, permit direct association with any specific individual. We may collect, use, transfer, and disclose non-personal information for any purpose. The following are some examples of non-personal information that we collect and how we may use it:---We may collect information such as occupation, language, zip code, area code, unique device identifier, referrer URL, location, and the time zone where an Apple product is used so that we can better understand customer behavior and improve our products, services, and advertising.---We may collect information regarding customer activities on our website, iCloud services, our iTunes Store, App Store, Mac App Store, App Store for Apple TV and iBooks Stores and from our other products and services. This information is aggregated and used to help us provide more useful information to our customers and to understand which parts of our website, products, and services are of most interest. Aggregated data is considered non\u2011personal information for the purposes of this Privacy Policy.---We may collect and store details of how you use our services, including search queries. This information may be used to improve the relevancy of results provided by our services. Except in limited instances to ensure quality of our services over the Internet, such information will not be associated with your IP address.---With your explicit consent, we may collect data about how you use your device and applications in order to help app developers improve their apps.If we do combine non-personal information with personal information the combined information will be treated as personal information for as long as it remains combined.Apple\u2019s websites, online services, interactive applications, email messages, and advertisements may use \"cookies\" and other technologies such as pixel tags and web beacons. These technologies help us better understand user behavior, tell us which parts of our websites people have visited, and facilitate and measure the effectiveness of advertisements and web searches. We treat information collected by cookies and other technologies as non\u2011personal information. However, to the extent that Internet Protocol (IP) addresses or similar identifiers are considered personal information by local law, we also treat these identifiers as personal information. Similarly, to the extent that non-personal information is combined with personal information, we treat the combined information as personal information for the purposes of this Privacy Policy.Ads that are delivered by Apple\u2019s advertising platform may appear in Apple News and in the App Store. If you do not wish to receive ads targeted to your interests from Apple's advertising platform, you can choose to enable Limit Ad Tracking, which will opt your Apple ID out of receiving such ads regardless of what device you are using. If you enable Limit AdTracking on your mobile device, third-party apps cannot use the Advertising Identifier, a non-personal device identifier, to serve you targeted ads. You may still see ads in the App Store or News based on context like your search query or the channel you are reading. In third-party apps, you may see ads based on other information.Apple and our partners also use cookies and other technologies to remember personal information when you use our website, online services, and applications. Our goal in these cases is to make your experience with Apple more convenient and personal. For example, knowing your first name lets us welcome you the next time you visit the Apple Online Store. Knowing your country and language \u2212 and if you are an educator, your school \u2212 helps us provide a customized and more useful shopping experience. Knowing someone using your computer or device has shopped for a certain product or used a particular service helps us make our advertising and email communications more relevant to your interests. And knowing your contact information, hardware identifiers, and information about your computer or device helps us personalize your operating system, set up your iCloud service, and provide you with better customer service.If you want to disable cookies and you\u2019re using the Safari web browser, go to Safari preferences and then to the privacy pane to manage your preferences. On your Apple mobile device, go to Settings, then Safari, scroll down to the Privacy & Security section, and tap on \u201cBlock Cookies\u201d to manage your preferences. For other browsers, check with your provider to find out how to disable cookies. Please note that certain features of the Apple website will not be available once cookies are disabled.As is true of most internet services, we gather some information automatically and store it in log files. This information includes Internet Protocol (IP) addresses, browser type and language, Internet service provider (ISP), referring and exit websites and applications, operating system, date/time stamp, and clickstream data. We use this information to understand and analyze trends, to administer the site, to learn about user behavior on the site, to improve our product and services, and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole. Apple may use this information in our marketing and advertising services.In some of our email messages, we use a \u201cclick-through URL\u201d linked to content on the Apple website. When customers click one of these URLs, they pass through a separate web server before arriving at the destination page on our website. We track this click-through data to help us determine interest in particular topics and measure the effectiveness of our customer communications. If you prefer not to be tracked in this way, you should not click text or graphic links in the email messages. Pixel tags enable us to send email messages in a format customers can read, and they tell us whether mail has been opened. We may use this information to reduce or eliminate messages sent to customers.At times Apple may provide third parties with certain personal information to provide or improve our products and services, including to deliver products at your request, or to help Apple market to consumers. When we do, we require those third parties to handle it in accordance with relevant laws. Personal information will never be shared with third parties for their marketing purposes. For example, when you purchase and activate your iPhone, you authorize Apple and your carrier to exchange the information you provide during the activation process to carry out service, including information about your device. If you are approved for service, your account will be governed by Apple and your carrier\u2019s respective privacy policies.Apple shares personal information with companies who provide services such as information processing, extending credit, fulfilling customer orders, delivering products to you, managing and enhancing customer data, providing customer service, assessing your interest in our products and services, and conducting customer research or satisfaction surveys. These companies are obligated to protect your information and may be located wherever Apple operates.It may be necessary \u2212 by law, legal process, litigation, and/or requests from public and governmental authorities within or outside your country of residence \u2212 for Apple to disclose your personal information. We may also disclose information about you if we determine that for purposes of national security, law enforcement, or other issues of public importance, disclosure is necessary or appropriate. We may also disclose information about you, but only where there is a lawful basis for doing so, if we determine that disclosure is reasonably necessary to enforce our terms and conditions or protect our operations or users.\u00a0 This could include providing information to public or governmental authorities. Additionally, in the event of a reorganization, merger, or sale we may transfer any and all personal information we collect to the relevant third party.Apple takes the security of your personal information very seriously. Apple online services such as the Apple Online Store and iTunes Store protect your personal information during transit using encryption such as Transport Layer Security (TLS). When your personal data is stored by Apple, we use computer systems with limited access housed in facilities using physical security measures. With the exception of iCloud Mail, iCloud data is stored in encrypted form including when we utilize third-party storage.When you use some Apple products, services, or applications or post on an Apple forum, chat room, or social networking service, the personal information and content you share is visible to other users and can be read, collected, or used by them. You are responsible for the personal information you choose to share or submit in these instances. For example, if you list your name and email address in a forum posting, that information is public. Please take care when using these features.If you or anyone else using Family Sharing logs on to a device that is owned by a third party, any information shared within your Family\u2014including calendar, location, photos, and iTunes purchases\u2014may be downloaded on to that third-party device thereby disclosing any such shared information. Visit Family Sharing for more information.The existence of Automated Decision-Making, Including ProfilingApple does not take any decisions involving the use of algorithms or profiling that significantly affects you.Integrity and Retention of Personal InformationApple makes it easy for you to keep your personal information accurate, complete, and up to date. We will retain your personal information for the period necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy and our service specific privacy summaries. When assessing these periods we carefully examine our need to collect personal information at all and if we establish a relevant need we only retain it for the shortest possible period to realize the purpose of collection unless a longer retention period is required by law.Access to Personal InformationYou can help ensure that your contact information and preferences are accurate, complete, and up to date by signing in to your Apple ID account page. For other personal information we hold, we will provide you with access (including a copy) for any purpose including to request that we correct the data if it is inaccurate or delete the data if Apple is not required to retain it by law or for legitimate business purposes.We may decline to process requests that are frivolous/vexatious, jeopardize the privacy of others, are extremely impractical, or for which access is not otherwise required by local law. We may also decline aspects of deletion or access requests if we believe doing so would undermine our legitimate use of data for anti-fraud and security purposes as described earlier. Online tools for the exercise of access, correction, or deletion requests are available on a regional basis by signing in to privacy.apple.com. Where the online tool is not currently available for access requests in your region, a request may be made directly to apple.com/legal/privacy/contact.Children & EducationWe understand the importance of taking extra precautions to protect the privacy and safety of children using Apple products and services. Children under the age of 13, or equivalent minimum age in the relevant jurisdiction, are not permitted to create their own Apple IDs, unless their parent provided verifiable consent or as part of the child account creation process in Family Sharing or they have obtained a Managed Apple ID account (where available) through their school. For example, a parent must review the Apple ID and Family Sharing Disclosure and agree to the Consent to Apple\u2019s Collection, Use and Disclosure of Your Child\u2019s Information; and the iTunes Store Terms and Conditions, before they can begin the Apple ID account creation process for their child. In addition, schools that participate in Apple School Manager and have reviewed and consented to the Managed Apple IDs for Students Disclosure may create Managed Apple IDs for students. The Managed Apple IDs for Students Disclosure describes how Apple handles student information and supplements Apple\u2019s Privacy Policy. Learn more about Family Sharing, the Managed Apple IDs and Restrictions for children\u2019s accounts. If we learn that we have collected the personal information of a child under 13, or equivalent minimum age depending on jurisdiction, outside the above circumstances we will take steps to delete the information as soon as possible. If at any time a parent needs to access, correct, or delete data associated with their Family Sharing account or child\u2019s Apple ID, they may contact us through one of the options provided at the bottom of this page.Location-Based ServicesTo provide location-based services on Apple products, Apple and our partners and licensees, such as maps data providers, may collect, use, and share precise location data, including the real-time geographic location of your Apple computer or device. Where available, location-based services may use GPS, Bluetooth, and your IP Address, along with crowd-sourced Wi-Fi hotspot and cell tower locations, and other technologies to determine your devices\u2019 approximate location. Unless you provide consent, this location data is collected anonymously in a form that does not personally identify you and is used by Apple and our partners and licensees to provide and improve location-based products and services. For example, your device may share its geographic location with application providers when you opt in to their location services.Some location-based services offered by Apple, such as the \u201cFind My iPhone\u201d feature, require your personal information for the feature to work.Third\u2011Party Sites and ServicesApple websites, products, applications, and services may contain links to third-party websites, products, and services. Our products and services may also use or offer products or services from third parties \u2212 for example, a third\u2011party iPhone app.Information collected by third parties, which may include such things as location data or contact details, is governed by their privacy practices. We encourage you to learn about the privacy practices of those third parties.If you purchase a subscription in a third party app or within News, we create a Subscriber ID that is unique to you and the developer or publisher which we use to provide reports to the developer or publisher that include information about the subscription you purchased, and your country of residence. If you cancel all of your subscriptions with a particular developer or publisher, the Subscriber ID will reset after 180 days if you do not resubscribe. This information is provided to developers so that they can understand the performance of their subscriptions.International UsersAll the information you provide may be transferred or accessed by entities around the world as described in this Privacy Policy. Personal information, relating to Apple services, regarding individuals who reside in a member state of the European Economic Area and Switzerland is controlled by Apple Distribution International in Ireland, and processed on its behalf by Apple Inc.

Apple, as a global company, has a number of legal entities in different jurisdictions which are responsible for the personal information which they collect and which is processed on their behalf by Apple Inc. For example, point of sale information in our Retail entities outside the U.S. is controlled by our individual Retail entities in each country. Apple, Online Store and iTunes related personal information may also be controlled by legal entities outside the U.S. as reflected in the terms of each service.Apple abides by the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) Cross Border Privacy Rules System.

If you pre-order Content, you will be charged when the Content is delivered to you (unless you cancel prior to the Content\u2019s availability). In accordance with local law, Apple may update information regarding your payment method if provided such information by your financial institution.

The Organizer hereby agrees (1) to pay for such Transactions, and (2) that Transactions initiated by Family members are authorized. Organizers are responsible for complying with their payment method contract, and assume all risk related to sharing access to the payment method with Family members. A receipt or invoice for any Family member Transaction is sent to the initiating Family member and the Organizer.Ask to Buy: Ask to Buy is a convenient feature that allows an Organizer to approve each Transaction initiated by a Family member under age 18 (or the equivalent age of majority in your Home Country). The Organizer must be the parent or legal guardian of any Family member for whom Ask to Buy is activated. Content downloaded from Family members or acquired via redemption codes are not subject to Ask to Buy.Family Member changes: When a Family member leaves or is removed from the Family, the remaining Family members may no longer be able to access the former member\u2019s Content, including Content acquired with the Organizer\u2019s payment method.Family Sharing Rules: You can only belong to one Family at a time, and may join any Family no more than twice per year. You can change the Apple ID you associate with a Family no more than once every 90 days. All Family members must share the same Home Country.

Season Pass or Multi-Pass Content is available for download up to 90 days after the last episode becomes available.

ADDITIONAL APP STORE TERMSLICENSE OF APP STORE CONTENTApp licenses are provided to you by Apple or a third party developer (\u201cApp Provider\u201d). If you are a customer of Apple Distribution International, the merchant of record is Apple Distribution International, which means that you acquire the App license from Apple Distribution International, but the App is licensed by the App Provider. An App licensed by Apple is an \u201cApple App;\u201d an App licensed by an App Provider is a \u201cThird Party App.\u201d Apple acts as an agent for App Providers in providing the App Store and is not a party to the sales contract or user agreement between you and the App Provider. Any App that you acquire is governed by the Licensed Application End User License Agreement (\u201cStandard EULA\u201d) set forth below, unless Apple or the App Provider provides an overriding custom license agreement (\u201cCustom EULA\u201d). The App Provider of any Third Party App is solely responsible for its content, warranties, and claims that you may have related to the Third Party App. You acknowledge and agree that Apple is a third-party beneficiary of the Standard EULA or Custom EULA applicable to each Third Party App and may therefore enforce such agreement. Certain Apps, such as stickers and iMessage apps, may not appear on the device springboard but can be accessed and used in the Messages app drawer.IN-APP PURCHASESApps may offer content, services or functionality for use within such Apps (\u201cIn-App Purchases\u201d).

We also have dedicated teams to look after your information security and privacy.\nAt the same time, no service can be completely secure - if you have any concerns that your BBC account or personal information has been put at risk, for example if someone could have found out your password, please get in touch straight away.\nWhere we store your information\nSome companies that provide services to us run their services from outside the European Economic Area. We only let that happen if we are satisfied with their levels of security. Keep in mind that when you give us personal information it could be being transferred, stored or processed in a location outside the EEA.\nBack to top\nWe'll give details about why we need your personal information and how we'll use it before you begin, unless it's obvious.\na. Information that you give us\nWe might ask for your name and contact details, your date of birth or financial details, depending on what you're doing. If you apply to take part in a programme on politics, for example, we might ask you about your political opinions. This could include information in a creation you share with us such as people's names that appear in the creation.\nb. Device information\nDevices are lots of things like:\n---your computer\n---your mobile\n---your TV\n---your tablet\n---your voice-enabled device\nWe automatically collect some technical information from these devices and web browsers even when you're not signed in to a BBC account. This might include:\n---IP (internet protocol) address\n---device ID\n---app ID\n---vendor ID\nc. Information on your activities outside the BBC when you talk about us\nLike if you've mentioned us in a Twitter post, we'll collect your Twitter handle.\nWhat if I have a BBC account?\nWhen you register for a BBC account, or update your details or settings we ask for some personal information, like your email address and age.\nWe also collect information about how you use our services, like the articles you read and the programmes you watch.\nBack to top\nWhen you give us any personal information we'll let you know how long we'll hold it for. And always stick to these principles:\n---we only hold your information for as long as we do the activities we told you about or have a valid reason to keep it\n---we think about what type of information it is, the amount collected, how sensitive it might be and any legal requirements\n---we design our services so that we don't hold your information any longer than we have to\n---we may close your BBC account if you haven't used it in the last year. We'll send you an email to tell you that we plan to do this before we delete anything, so please check to see if we've sent you any emails about this\nBack to top\nWe have to have a valid reason to use your personal information. It's called the \"lawful basis for processing\". Sometimes we might ask your permission to do things, like when you subscribe to an email. Other times, when you'd reasonably expect us to use your personal information, we don't ask your permission, but only when:\n---the law says it's fine to use it, and\n---it fits with the rights you have\nWe use your information for these types of things:\na. to deliver our services and to provide you with information about them\nb. to deal with your requests, complaints and enquiries\nc. to check if you're using BBC iPlayer and to keep the licensing database accurate and up to date\nd. to personalise services and give you things more tailored to your tastes\nPersonalisation is turned on in your account settings.\nIf you don't want to receive personalised services you can turn this option off.\nEven if you have personalisation turned off, we still collect information about how you use the BBC, but it will be anonymous. For example, we'd be able to see that someone looked at a particular story on BBC News but we wouldn't be able to tell that it was you.\ne. to show you relevant advertising on another company's site\nf. to help us understand what kind of services you might use\nAnd sometimes how you might share things with other people.\ng. to recommend things we think might interest you\nh. to show you advertising when you access a BBC service from outside the UK\nSome of this advertising might be tailored to you.\ni. to research and innovate\nYou're not a guinea-pig here, but knowing how you use our services could lead to the next big technology breakthrough.\nj. to contact you about various things\nBack to top\nWe might use your information to contact you about different things, like:\n---to update you on any changes to the BBC's policies, practices and Terms of Use\n---to check with you about any service or activity you've signed up for. For example we might tell you if your BBC account hasn't been used in a long time. Or it might be about creating a child account\n---to contact you about a creation you sent us, like things you've sent in to School Report news day\n---to answer you when you've contacted us, or to respond to a comment or complaint\n---to invite you to take part in surveys about the BBC services, which are always voluntary\n---for marketing purposes\n---to send you notification on your device if you've selected them in your settings\nWe'll only contact you when we need to or when you've given us permission.\nWe'll never contact you to ask for your BBC account password.\nBack to top\nWe'll only send you marketing emails or contact you about BBC programmes, services and your views on issues about the BBC if you've agreed to this.\nKeep in mind, even if you unsubscribe, we may still contact you.\nWill my personal information be used when the BBC advertises with other companies?\nIf you have a BBC account we might use information that we hold about you to show you relevant and \"targeted advertising\" through other companies' sites, like Facebook, Google, Snapchat or Twitter for example. This could be showing you a BBC advertising message where we know you have a BBC account and have used BBC services.\nIf you don't want to see our targeted advertising, you can set ad preferences in your social media companies' settings. Also, you can visit your BBC account and turn off personalisation, but it will also turn off all personalised services.\nBack to top\nWe'll never sell your personal information. We do share it with others in these ways:\na. When you make something public\nLike post a comment which the public can see.\nb. When we use other companies to power our services\nIn order for us to give you quality experiences and to understand how you're using our services we often use other companies to process your personal information on our behalf. For example, sending you emails about things we think might interest you, or to ask you what you think about our services.\nWe make sure that your personal information is looked after as if we were handling it directly. We carefully select these companies, only share with them what they need to do the work and we make sure they keep your information secure.\nc. When we share personal information with companies in the BBC family\nd. When you use another company's service that connects to us, like voice-enabled devices\nTo access our services through a voice-enabled device, like Amazon Alexa, you need to connect your device to your BBC account. We'll share an identifier for your BBC account with the voice service. It's completely up to you if you want to use the BBC in this way.\ne. When we do collaborative research\nWe do research activities and sometimes collaborate with research partners. Every now and then we share our content and data with them. This might include information we've collected about you. But we're careful about what we share and what our research partners can do with it.\nf. TV Licensing\nWe share some personal information with TV Licensing, to check if you're using BBC iPlayer and to keep the licensing database accurate and up to date.\ng. Sometimes by law we have to pass on your information to other organisations\nWe might also share your information if we have to by law, or when we need to protect you or other people from harm.\nBack to top\nThe BBC has services that are kid-friendly and for teens.Here's what happens when you use them.\na. Why do we collect information about you in the first place?\nWe keep information about you so that we can:\n---get the right services for you\n---plan and improve our services\n---keep in touch with you\nb. We'll always tell you why we're collecting your personal information\nWe'll explain why and how we use it and for how long. It's called a \"privacy notice\". And if we need your parent or guardian's permission we'll give you clear details about what's needed at the time.\nc. We can only use your personal information if we have a valid reason\nd. We share personal information about you to others but we follow some rules\nThe main rule is we never sell your personal information to anyone.\ne. We might ask you to tell us your age\nTo make sure you use parts of the BBC that are suitable for you. For example:\n---so that adults don't post comments on kid's message boards\n---when you want to get a BBC account\n---when you're watching a programme, like on BBC iPlayer, and it's a bit edgy\nf. Sometimes we'll ask to get your parent or guardian's consent\nYou'll see a notification. We might also ask for some details from them, so that we can contact them. Other times we may contact your parent or guardian:\n---so you can get notifications from us\n---so we can show you more things we think you'll like, based on what you do\n---so you can post comments\n---so you can upload your contributions to us\ng. Sometimes we'll tell your parents about your activities\nFor example, if you're under 13 and your parent has asked to see every creation you upload, we'll share it with them before it goes public.\nh. When we contact you\nSometimes we'll need to get in touch with you but we'll always follow these rules.\ni. It's safe to use us\nIt's our job to keep your personal information safe and secure. That's why we design our services with your safety in mind. And we're always looking for the best ways to improve this.\nThere are also things that you can do to keep safe, like thinking about what information you share and how to keep your devices secure.\nj. Human beings and not robots will make the big decisions that affect you\nk. You might not be able to use our services if you're outside the UK\nIf you're outside the UK you might not be able to access some services. Like CBBC and CBeebies.\nAnd you may not be able to get a BBC account. Sorry about that.\nl. You're in control of how we use cookies and tracking\nCookies are bits of data that are stored on your device. Some things on our websites wouldn't be able to work without these cookies. So they're always on when you visit us.\nWe use cookies and tracking to make things easier for you, like remembering where you got to in a game or what emoji you selected.\nYou can switch off some cookies and similar tracking technologies. Or your parent or guardian can do this if you're under 13.\nm. What we do when you post, upload or share a creation\nWhen you share your creation with us we'll try to tell you exactly what we're going to do with it.\nn. You've got privacy rights, the same as adults, so get to know what they are\nYou can:\n---ask us what personal information we hold about you\n---ask us to correct or delete your personal information\n---tell us to stop using your personal information\nIf you're 13 or older, you can do this yourself, but not always.\nSometimes we'll be asking for your parent or guardian to do that.\nIf you're under 13 your parent or guardian probably has to do it for you.\nBack to top\nThis depends on what information you're talking about.\na. If you're talking about BBC account\nYou can delete your account. Your account information is immediately deleted. Keep in mind:\n---we keep a record of how you've used our services, but this information can't be linked back to you\n---we also keep anything you've uploaded or commented on\nb. What about other information I've shared with you?\nWe might have collected other personal information that you might ask to be deleted that has nothing to do with BBC account.\nBack to top\nRemember, you're in control of your personal information.\nYou have the right to:\n---request a copy of your information\n---not let robots make big decisions about you\n---to ask us to correct information that's wrong, to delete it or to request that we only use it for certain purposes\n---to change your mind, and ask us to stop using your information. For example, unsubscribing from any marketing emails or turning off personalisation\nBear in mind, sometimes we might not be able to help. Like if the law tells us we can't or it forms part of our journalistic output.\nBack to top\na. What are cookies and tracking technologies?\nCookies are bits of data which are stored in your computer or mobile when you visit a website or app.\nThere are also similar pieces of tracking information we collect.\nb. Why do we use cookies and other tracking?\nTo do a few different things:\n---to remember information about you, so you don't have to give it to us again. And again. And again\n---to keep you signed in, even on different devices\n---to help us understand how people are using our services, so we can make them better\n---to deliver advertising to websites outside of the UK\n---to help us personalise the BBC to you by remembering your preferences and settings. And your progress, so you can pause and pick up where you left off watching a programme, even on a different device\n---to find out if our emails have been read and if you find them useful\nA few things on our websites wouldn't work without some cookies. Tech people call these \"strictly necessary cookies\". They're always on when you visit us.\nBut we want to use others like functional, performance and advertising cookies to make your experience more enjoyable. We'll only use them if you've agreed. You can always change your mind.\nBear in mind there are some other cookies out there from other companies. These \"third-party cookies\" might track how you use different websites, including ours. For example, you might get a social media company's cookie when you see the option to share something. You can turn them off, but not through us.\nc. How long do cookies last?\nSome are erased when you close the browser on your website or app. Others stay longer, sometimes forever, and are saved onto your device so they're there when you come back.\nd. How do I control my cookies and tracking?\nWhen you first visit us, we'll tell you about our cookies and ask you to agree if we can use them. You can always change your mind by going to your settings.\nStopping all cookies might mean you can't access some BBC services, or that some of them might not work properly for you.\nAnother way to control some tracking is in the settings on your device.\nBack to top\nWe update this policy sometimes. If we make important changes, like how we use your personal information, we'll let you know. It might be a notice, an email, or a message in your app.\nIf you don't agree to the changes, then you can always stop using our services, delete your account and stop giving us any more personal information.

We won't pay you for it\nWe appreciate you sharing your creation with us but sadly we can\u2019t pay you.\nc.

Use, host or store it in BBC services and content\nSo you might see your creation on TV, on BBC Online, social media or on other sites who have our permission to feature some of our content.\nb. Copy, change or translate it, or make things inspired by it\nWe will only edit your news related content where necessary.\u00a0Read about how we use your news related comments and creations here.\nc.

Share it to do research\nWe do research activities and sometimes collaborate with research partners. Every now and then we share our content and data with them. But we're careful about what we share and what our research partners can do with it.\ne. Moderate it\nWhich means we can review, edit, remove or decide not to display it.

Google will post notice of modifications to these terms at www.google.com/analytics/, the\n            Google Analytics Policies at www.google.com/analytics/policies/, or other policies referenced in\n            these terms at the applicable URL for such policies.

This Agreement (including any amendment agreed upon by the parties in writing)\n            represents the complete agreement between You and Google concerning its subject matter,\n            and supersedes all prior agreements and representations between the parties. If any\n            provision of this Agreement is held to be unenforceable for any reason, such provision\n            will be reformed to the extent necessary to make it enforceable to the maximum extent\n            permissible so as to effect the intent of the parties, and the remainder of this\n            Agreement will continue in full force and effect. This Agreement will be governed by\n            and construed under the laws of the state of California without reference to its\n            conflict of law principles. In the event of any conflicts between foreign law, rules,\n            and regulations, and California law, rules, and regulations, California law, rules and\n            regulations will prevail and govern.

In particular, we use data to:---Provide our products, which includes updating, securing, and troubleshooting, as well as providing support. It also includes sharing data, when it is required to provide the service or carry out the transactions you request.---Improve and develop our products.---Personalize our products and make recommendations.---Advertise and market to you, which includes sending promotional communications, targeting advertising, and presenting you with relevant offers.We also use the data to operate our business, which includes analyzing our performance, meeting our legal obligations, developing our workforce, and doing research. In carrying out these purposes, we combine data we collect from different contexts (for example, from your use of two Microsoft products) or obtain from third parties to give you a more seamless, consistent, and personalized experience, to make informed business decisions, and for other legitimate purposes.Full textMicrosoft uses the data we collect to provide you rich, interactive experiences. In particular, we use data to:---Provide our products, which includes updating, securing, and troubleshooting, as well as providing support. It also includes sharing data, when it is required to provide the service or carry out the transactions you request.---Improve and develop our products.---Personalize our products and make recommendations.---Advertise and market to you, which includes sending promotional communications, targeting advertising, and presenting you relevant offers.We also use the data to operate our business, which includes analyzing our performance, meeting our legal obligations, developing our workforce, and doing research. For these purposes, we combine data we collect from different contexts (for example, from your use of two Microsoft products). For example, Cortana uses the favorite sports teams you add to the Microsoft Sports app to provide information relevant to your interests, and Microsoft Store uses information about the apps and services you use to make personalized app recommendations. However, we have built in technological and procedural safeguards designed to prevent certain data combinations where required by law. For example, where required by law, we store data we collect from you when you are unauthenticated (not signed in) separately from any account information that directly identifies you, such as your name, email address, or phone number.When we process personal data about you, we do so with your consent and/or as necessary to provide the products you use, operate our business, meet our contractual and legal obligations, protect the security of our systems and our customers, or fulfill other legitimate interests of Microsoft as described in this section and in the\r\nReasons we share personal data\u00a0section of this privacy statement. When we transfer personal data from the European Economic Area, we do so based on a variety of legal mechanisms, as described in the\r\nWhere we store and process personal data\u00a0section of this privacy statement.More on the purposes of processing:---Provide our products. We use data to operate our products and provide you with rich, interactive experiences. For example, if you use OneDrive, we process the documents you upload to OneDrive to enable you to retrieve, delete, edit, forward, or otherwise process it, at your direction as part of the service. Or, for example, if you enter a search query in the Bing search engine, we use that query to display search results to you. Additionally, as communications are a feature of various products, programs, and activities, we use data to contact you. For example, we may contact you by phone or email or other means to inform you when a subscription is ending or discuss your licensing account. We also communicate with you to secure our products, for example by letting you know when product updates are available.---Product improvement. We use data to continually improve our products, including adding new features or capabilities. For example, we use error reports to improve security features, search queries and clicks in Bing to improve the relevancy of the search results, usage data to determine what new features to prioritize, and voice data to improve speech recognition accuracy.---Personalization. Many products include personalized features, such as recommendations that enhance your productivity and enjoyment. These features use automated processes to tailor your product experiences based on the data we have about you, such as inferences we make about you and your use of the product, activities, interests, and location. For example, depending on your settings, if you stream movies in a browser on your Windows device, you may see a recommendation for an app from the Microsoft Store that streams more efficiently. If you have a Microsoft account, with your permission, we can sync your settings on several devices. Many of our products provide controls to disable personalized features.---Product activation. We use data\u2014such as device and application type, location, and unique device, application, network, and subscription identifiers\u2014to activate products that require activation.---Product development. We use data to develop new products. For example, we use data, often de-identified, to better understand our customers\u2019 computing and productivity needs which can shape the development of new products.---Customer support. We use data to troubleshoot and diagnose product problems, repair customers\u2019 devices, and provide other customer care and support services.---Help secure and troubleshoot. We use data to help secure and troubleshoot our products. This includes using data to protect the security and safety of our products and customers, detecting malware and malicious activities, troubleshooting performance and compatibility issues to help customers get the most out of their experiences, and notifying customers of updates to our products. This may include using automated systems to detect security and safety issues.---Safety. We use data to protect the safety of our products and our customers. Our security features and products can disrupt the operation of malicious software and notify users if malicious software is found on their devices. For example, some of our  products, such as Outlook or OneDrive, systematically scan content in an automated manner to identify suspected spam, viruses, abusive actions, or URLs that have been flagged as fraud, phishing, or malware links; and we reserve the right to block delivery of a communication or remove content if it violates our terms.---Updates. We use data we collect to develop product updates and security patches.

We also share data with Microsoft-controlled affiliates and subsidiaries; with vendors working on our behalf; when required by law or to respond to legal process; to protect our customers; to protect lives; to maintain the security of our products; and to protect the rights and property of Microsoft and its customers.\r\nFull text\r\n    We share your personal data with your consent or as necessary to complete any transaction or provide any product you have requested or authorized. For example, we share your content with third parties when you tell us to do so, such as when you send an email to a friend, share photos and documents on OneDrive, or link accounts with another service. If you use a Microsoft product provided by an organization you are affiliated with, such as an employer or school, or use an email address provided by such organization to access Microsoft products, we share certain data, such as interaction data and diagnostic data to enable your organization to manage the products. When you provide payment data to make a purchase, we will share payment data with banks and other entities that process payment transactions or provide other financial services, and for fraud prevention and credit risk reduction. \r\n\r\n    In addition, we share personal data among Microsoft-controlled affiliates and subsidiaries. We also share personal data with vendors or agents working on our behalf for the purposes described in this statement. For example, companies we've hired to provide customer service support or assist in protecting and securing our systems and services may need access to personal data to provide those functions. In such cases, these companies must abide by our data privacy and security requirements and are not allowed to use personal data they receive from us for any other purpose. We may also disclose personal data as part of a corporate transaction such as a merger or sale of assets.\r\n\r\n    Finally, we will retain, access, transfer, disclose, and preserve personal data, including your content (such as the content of your emails in Outlook.com, or files in private folders on OneDrive), when we have a good faith belief that doing so is necessary to do any of the following:\r\n---Comply with applicable law or respond to valid legal process, including from law enforcement or other government agencies. ---Protect our customers, for example, to prevent spam or attempts to defraud users of our products, or to help prevent the loss of life or serious injury of anyone.---Operate and maintain the security of our products, including to prevent or stop an attack on our computer systems or networks.---Protect the rights or property of Microsoft, including enforcing the terms governing the use of the services\u2014however, if we receive information indicating that someone is using our services to traffic in stolen intellectual or physical property of Microsoft, we will not inspect a customer's private content ourselves, but we may refer the matter to law enforcement.\r\n    For more information about data we disclose in response to requests from law enforcement and other government agencies, please see our Law Enforcement Requests Report. \r\n    Please note that some of our products include links to products of third parties whose privacy practices differ from those of Microsoft.

In some cases, your ability to access or control your personal data will be limited, as required or permitted by applicable law.\r\n\r\n    If your organization, such as your employer, school, or service provider, provides you with access to and is administering your use of Microsoft products, contact your organization to learn more about how to access and control your personal data.\r\n\r\n    You can access and control your personal data that Microsoft has obtained, and exercise your data protection rights, using various tools we provide. The tools most useful to you will depend on our interactions with you and your use of our products. Here is a general list of tools we provide to help you control your personal data; specific products may provide additional controls.\r\n---Microsoft privacy dashboard. You can control some of the data Microsoft processes through your use of a Microsoft account on the Microsoft privacy dashboard. From here, for example, you can view and clear the browsing, search, and location data associated with your Microsoft account. You can also manage data in your Cortana Notebook and Microsoft Health services. ---Microsoft account. If you wish to access, edit, or remove the profile information and payment information in your Microsoft account, change your password, add security information or close your account, you can do so by visiting the \r\nMicrosoft account website.---Volume Licensing Service Center (VLSC). If you are a Volume Licensing customer, you can control your contact information and subscription and licensing data in one location by visiting the Volume Licensing Service Center website.---Skype. If you wish to access, edit, or remove some profile and payment information in your account for Skype or change your password, sign in to your account.---Xbox.

You can access your Microsoft Store profile and account information by visiting Microsoft Store and selecting View account or Order history.---Microsoft.com. You can access and update your profile on microsoft.com by visiting your Microsoft account profile page.---If you have a Microsoft Developer Network (MSDN) public profile, you can access and edit your data by signing in at MSDN forum.\r\n    Not all personal data processed by Microsoft can be accessed or controlled via the tools above. If you want to access or control personal data processed by Microsoft that is not available via the tools above or directly through the Microsoft products you use, you can always contact Microsoft at the address in the How to contact us section or by using our web form. We will respond to requests to control your personal data within 30 days.Your communications preferences \r\n    You can choose whether you wish to receive promotional communications from Microsoft by email, SMS, physical mail, and telephone. If you receive promotional email or SMS messages from us and would like to opt out, you can do so by following the directions in that message. You can also make choices about the receipt of promotional email, telephone calls, and postal mail by signing in with your personal Microsoft account, and viewing your communication permissions where you can update contact information, manage Microsoft-wide contact preferences, opt out of email subscriptions, and choose whether to share your contact information with Microsoft partners. If you do not have a personal Microsoft account, you can manage your Microsoft email contact preferences by using this \r\nweb form. These choices do not apply to mandatory service communications that are part of certain Microsoft products, programs, activities, or to surveys or other informational communications that have their own \r\n    unsubscribe method.\r\nYour advertising choices\r\n    To opt out of receiving interest-based advertising from Microsoft, visit our opt-out page. When you opt out, your preference is stored in a cookie that is specific to the web browser you are using. The opt-out cookie has an expiration date of five years. If you delete the cookies on your device, you need to opt out again.\r\n\r\n    You can also link your opt-out choice with your personal Microsoft account. It will then apply on any device where you use that account and will continue to apply until someone signs in with a different personal Microsoft account on that device. If you delete the cookies on your device, you will need to sign in again for the settings to apply.\r\n\r\n    For Microsoft-controlled advertising that appears in apps on Windows, you may use the opt-out linked to your personal Microsoft account, or opt out of interest-based advertising by turning off the advertising ID in Windows settings.\r\n    Because the data used for interest-based advertising is also used for other necessary purposes (including providing our products, analytics, and fraud detection), opting out of interest-based advertising does not stop that data collection. You will continue to get ads, although they may be less relevant to you.\r\n\r\n    You can opt out of receiving interest-based advertising from third parties we partner with by visiting their sites (see above).Browser-based controls \r\n    When you use a browser, you can control your personal data using certain features. For example:---Cookie controls. You can control the data stored by cookies and withdraw consent to cookies by using the browser-based cookie controls described in the Cookies section of this privacy statement. ---Tracking protection. You can control the data third-party sites can collect about you using Tracking Protection in Internet Explorer (versions 9 and up). This feature will block third-party content, including cookies, from any site that is listed in a Tracking Protection List you add. ---Browser controls for \"Do Not Track.\" Some browsers have incorporated \"Do Not Track\" (DNT) features that can send a signal to the websites you visit indicating you do not wish to be tracked. Because there is not yet a common understanding of how to interpret the DNT signal, Microsoft services do not currently respond to browser DNT signals. We continue to work with the online industry to define a common understanding of how to treat DNT signals. In the meantime, you can use the range of other tools we provide to control data collection and use, including the ability to opt out of receiving interest-based advertising from Microsoft as described above.

See opt-out links below.---Companies that deliver content, such as videos or news, or ads on Microsoft sites, place cookies on their own. These companies use the data they process in accordance with their privacy policies, which may enable these companies to collect and combine information about your activities across websites, apps, or online services.How to control cookiesMost web browsers automatically accept cookies but provide controls that allow you to block or delete them. For example, in Microsoft Edge, you can block or delete cookies by selecting Settings > Privacy > Advanced Settings > Cookies. Please refer to your browser's privacy or help documentation to find Instructions for blocking or deleting cookies in other browsers.Certain features of Microsoft products depend on cookies.

Additional privacy controls that can impact cookies, including the Tracking Protection feature of Microsoft browsers, are described in the How to access and control your personal data section of this privacy statement. Our use of web beacons and analytics servicesSome Microsoft webpages contain electronic tags known as web beacons that we use to help deliver cookies on our websites, count users who have visited those websites, and deliver co-branded products. We also include web beacons or similar technologies in our electronic communications to determine whether you open and act on them.In addition to placing web beacons on our own websites, we sometimes work with other companies to place our web beacons on their websites or in their advertisements. This helps us develop statistics on how often clicking on an advertisement on a Microsoft website results in a purchase or other action on the advertiser's website. Finally, Microsoft products often contain web beacons or similar technologies from third-party analytics providers, which help us compile aggregated statistics about the effectiveness of our promotional campaigns or other operations. These technologies enable the analytics providers to set or read their own cookies or other identifiers on your device, through which they can collect information about your online activities across applications, websites, or other products. However, we prohibit these analytics providers from using web beacons on our sites to collect or access information that directly identifies you (such as your name or email address). You can opt out of data collection or use by some of these analytics providers by clicking any of the following links: Adjust, \r\nAppsFlyer, \r\nClicktale, \r\nFlurry Analytics, \r\nGoogle Analytics (requires you to install a browser add-on), \r\nKissmetrics, \r\nMixpanel, \r\nNielsen, \r\nVisible Measures, or \r\nWebTrends.\r\nOther similar technologiesIn addition to standard cookies and web beacons, our products can also use other similar technologies to store and read data files on your computer. This is typically done to maintain your preferences or to improve speed and performance by storing certain files locally. But, like standard cookies, these technologies can also store a unique identifier for your computer, which can then track behavior. These technologies include Local Shared Objects (or \"Flash cookies\") and Silverlight Application Storage.Local Shared Objects or \"Flash cookies.\" Websites that use Adobe Flash technologies can use Local Shared Objects or \"Flash cookies\" to store data on your computer.

Signing in to your Microsoft account enables personalization and consistent experiences across products and devices, permits you to use cloud data storage, allows you to make payments using payment instruments stored in your Microsoft account, and enables other features.\r\n\r\n    There are three types of Microsoft account:\r\n---When you create your own Microsoft account tied to your personal email address, we refer to that account as a personal Microsoft account. ---When you or your organization (such as an employer or your school) create your Microsoft account tied to your email address provided by that organization, we refer to that account as a work or school account. ---When you or your service provider (such as a cable or internet service provider) create your Microsoft account tied to your email address with your service provider\u2019s domain, we refer to that account as a third-party account. \r\n    If you sign into a service offered by a third party with your Microsoft account, you will share with that third party the account data required by that service.\r\nFull textWith a Microsoft account, you can sign into Microsoft products, as well as those of select Microsoft partners. Personal data associated with your Microsoft account includes credentials, name and contact data, payment data, device and usage data, your contacts, information about your activities, and your interests and favorites. Signing into your Microsoft account enables personalization, consistent experiences across products and devices, permits you to use cloud data storage, allows you to make payments using payment instruments stored in your Microsoft account, and enables other features. There are three types of Microsoft account:---When you create your own Microsoft account tied to your personal email address, we refer to that account as a personal Microsoft account. ---When you or your organization (such as an employer or your school) create your Microsoft account tied to your email address provided by that organization, we refer to that account as a work or school account. ---When you or your service provider (such as a cable or internet service provider) create your Microsoft account tied to your email address with your service provider\u2019s domain, we refer to that account as a third-party account. Personal Microsoft accounts. The data associated with your personal Microsoft account, and how that data is used, depends on how you use the account.---Creating your Microsoft account. When you create a personal Microsoft account, you will be asked to provide certain personal data and we will assign a unique ID number to identify your account and associated information. While some products, such as those involving payment, require a real name, you can sign in to and use other Microsoft products without providing your real name. Some data you provide, such as your display name, email address, and phone number, can be used to help others find and connect with you within Microsoft products. For example, people who know your display name, email address, or phone number can use it to search for you on Skype and send you an invite to connect with them. Note that if you use a work or school email address to create a personal Microsoft account, your employer or school may gain access to your data. In some cases, you will need to change the email address to a personal email address in order to continue accessing consumer-oriented products (such \r\n        as Xbox Live). ---Signing in to Microsoft account. When you sign in to your Microsoft account, we create a record of your sign-in, which includes the date and time, information about the product you signed in to, your sign-in name, the unique number assigned to your account, a unique identifier assigned to your device, your IP address, and your operating system and browser version.---Signing in to Microsoft products. Signing in to your account enables improved personalization, provides seamless and consistent experiences across products and devices, permits you to access and use cloud data storage, allows you to make payments using payment instruments stored in your Microsoft account, and enables other enhanced features and settings. When you sign in to your account, you will stay signed in until you sign out. If you add your Microsoft account to a Windows device (version 8 or higher), Windows will automatically sign you in to products that use Microsoft account when you access those products on that device. When you are signed in, some products will display your name or username and your profile photo (if you have added one to your profile) as part of your use of Microsoft products, including in your communications, social interactions, and public posts.---Signing in to third-party products. If you sign in to a third-party product with your Microsoft account, you will share data with the third party in accordance with the third party\u2019s privacy policy. The third party will also receive the version number assigned to your account (a new version number is assigned each time you change your sign-in data); and information that describes whether your account has been deactivated. If you share your profile data, the third party can display your name or user name and your profile photo (if you have added one to your profile) when you are signed in to that third-party product. If you chose to make payments to third-party merchants using your Microsoft account, Microsoft will pass information stored in your Microsoft account to the third party or its vendors (e.g., payment processors) as necessary to process your payment and fulfill your order (such as name, credit card number, billing and shipping addresses, and relevant contact information). The third party can use or share the data it receives when you sign in or make a purchase according to its own practices and policies. You should carefully review the privacy statement for each product you sign in to and each merchant you purchase from to determine how it will use the data it collects.Work or school accounts. The data associated with a work or school account, and how it will be used, is generally similar to the use and collection of data associated with a personal Microsoft account.If your employer or school uses Azure Active Directory (AAD) to manage the account it provides you, you can use your work or school account to sign in to Microsoft products, such as Office 365, and third-party products provided to you by your organization. If required by your organization, you will also be asked to provide a phone number or an alternative email address for additional security verification. And, if allowed by your organization, you may also use your work or school account to sign in to Microsoft or third-party products that you acquire for yourself.If you sign in to Microsoft products with a work or school account, note:---The owner of the domain associated with your email address may control and administer your account, and access and process your data, including the contents of your communications and files, including data stored in products provided to you by your organization, and products you acquire by yourself.---Your use of the products is subject to your organization\u2019s policies, if any. You should consider both your organization\u2019s policies and whether you are comfortable enabling your organization to access your data before you choose to use your work or school account to sign in to products you acquire for yourself. ---If you lose access to your work or school account (if you change employers, for example), you may lose access to products, including content associated with those products, you acquired on your own behalf if you used your work or school account to sign in to such products.---Microsoft is not responsible for the privacy or security practices of your organization, which may differ from those of Microsoft.---If your organization is administering your use of Microsoft products, please direct your privacy inquiries, including any requests to exercise your data subject rights, to your administrator. See also the Notice to end users section of this privacy statement. Third-party accounts. The data associated with a third-party Microsoft account, and how it will be used, is generally similar to the use and collection of data associated with a personal Microsoft account.  Your service provider has control over your account, including the ability to access or delete your account. You should carefully review the terms the third party provided you to understand what it can do with your account.Other important privacy informationmainotherimportantprivacyinformationmoduleSummaryBelow you will find additional privacy information, such as how we secure your data, where we process your data, and how long we retain your data.

For example, their laws may not guarantee you the same rights, or there may not be a privacy supervisory authority there that is capable of addressing your complaints. When we engage in such transfers, we use a variety of legal mechanisms, including contracts, to help ensure your rights and protections travel with your data. To learn more about the European Commission\u2019s decisions on the adequacy of the protection of personal data in the countries where Microsoft processes personal data, see this article on the European Commission website.\r\n    Microsoft Corporation complies with the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework and Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal information transferred from the European Union, the United Kingdom, and Switzerland to the United States. Microsoft Corporation has certified to the Department of Commerce that it adheres to the Privacy Shield Principles. If third-party agents process personal data on our behalf in a manner inconsistent with the principles of either Privacy Shield framework, we remain liable unless we prove we are not responsible for the event giving rise to the damage. The controlled U.S. subsidiaries of Microsoft Corporation, as identified in our self-certification submission, also adhere to the Privacy Shield Principles\u2014for more info, see the list of Microsoft U.S. entities or subsidiaries adhering to the Privacy Shield Principles.\r\n    If there is any conflict between the terms in this privacy policy and the Privacy Shield Principles, the Privacy Shield Principles shall govern. To learn more about the Privacy Shield program, and to view our certification, visit the Privacy Shield website.\r\n    If you have a question or complaint related to participation by Microsoft in the EU-U.S. or Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield, we encourage you to contact us via our web form. For any complaints related to the Privacy Shield frameworks that Microsoft cannot resolve directly, we have chosen to cooperate with the relevant EU Data Protection Authority, or a panel established by the European data protection authorities, for resolving disputes with EU individuals, and with the Swiss Federal Data Protection and Information Commissioner (FDPIC) for resolving disputes with Swiss individuals. Please contact us if you\u2019d like us to direct you to your data protection authority contacts. As further explained in the Privacy Shield Principles, binding arbitration is available to address residual complaints not resolved by other \r\n    means. Microsoft is subject to the investigatory and enforcement powers of the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC). Our retention of personal datamainOurretentionofpersonaldatamoduleSummaryMicrosoft retains personal data for as long as necessary to provide the products and fulfill the transactions you have requested, or for other legitimate purposes such as complying with our legal obligations, resolving disputes, and enforcing our agreements. Because these needs can vary for different data types, the context of our interactions with you or your use of products, actual retention periods can vary significantly.Other criteria used to determine the retention periods include:---Do customers provide, create, or maintain the data with the expectation we will retain it until they affirmatively remove it? Examples include a document you store in OneDrive, or an email message you keep in your Outlook.com inbox. In such cases, we would aim to maintain the data until you actively delete it, such as by moving an email from your Outlook.com inbox to the Deleted Items folder, and then emptying that folder (when your Deleted Items folder is emptied, those emptied items remain in our system for up to 30 days before final deletion). (Note that there may be other reasons why the data has to be deleted sooner, for example if you exceed limits on how much data can be stored in your account.)---Is there an automated control, such as in the Microsoft privacy dashboard, that enables the customer to access and delete the personal data at any time? If there is not, a shortened data retention time will generally be adopted.---Is the personal data of a sensitive type? If so, a shortened retention time would generally be adopted. ---Has Microsoft adopted and announced a specific retention period for a certain data type? For example, for Bing search queries, we de-identify stored queries by removing the entirety of the IP address after 6 months, and cookie IDs and other cross-session identifiers after 18 months.---Has the user provided consent for a longer retention period? If so, we will retain data in accordance with your consent.---Is Microsoft subject to a legal, contractual, or similar obligation to retain or delete the data? Examples can include mandatory data retention laws in the applicable jurisdiction, government orders to preserve data relevant to an investigation, or data retained for the purposes of litigation. Conversely, if we are required by law to remove unlawful content, we will do so.AdvertisingmainadvertisingmoduleSummaryAdvertising allows us to provide, support, and improve some of our products. Microsoft does not use what you say in email, chat, video calls or voice mail, or your documents, photos, or other personal files to target ads to you. We use other data, detailed below, for advertising in our products and on third-party properties. For example:---Microsoft may use data we collect to select and deliver some of the ads you see on Microsoft web properties, such as Microsoft.com, MSN, and Bing.---When the advertising ID is enabled in Windows 10 as part of your privacy settings, third parties can access and use the advertising ID (much the same way that websites can access and use a unique identifier stored in a cookie) to select and deliver ads in such apps.---We may share data we collect with third parties, such as Oath, AppNexus, or Facebook (see below), so that the ads you see in our products, their products, or other sites and apps serviced by these partners are more relevant and valuable to you. ---Advertisers may choose to place our web beacons on their sites, or use similar technologies, in order to allow Microsoft to collect information on their sites such as activities, purchases, and visits; we use this data on behalf of our advertising customers to provide ads. The ads that you see may be selected based on data we process about you, such as your interests and favorites, your location, your transactions, how you use our products, your search queries, or the content you view. For example, if you view content on MSN about automobiles, we may show advertisements about cars; if you search \u201cpizza places in Seattle\u201d on Bing, you may see advertisements in your search results for restaurants in Seattle.The ads that you see may also be selected based on other information learned about you over time using demographic data, location data, search queries, interests and favorites, usage data from our products and sites, as well as the sites and apps of our advertisers and partners. We refer to these ads as \"interest-based advertising\" in this statement. For example, if you view gaming content on xbox.com, you may see offers for games on MSN. To provide interest-based advertising, we combine cookies placed on your device using information that we collect (such as IP address) when your browser interacts with our websites. If you opt out of receiving interest-based advertising, data associated with these cookies will not be used.Further details regarding our advertising-related uses of data include:---Advertising industry best practices and commitments. Microsoft is a member of the Network Advertising Initiative (NAI) and adheres to the NAI Code of Conduct. We also adhere to the following self-regulatory programs:\r\n        In the US: Digital Advertising Alliance (DAA)In Europe: European Interactive Digital Advertising Alliance (EDAA)In Canada: Ad Choices: Digital Advertising Alliance of Canada (DAAC) / Choix de Pub: l'Alliance de la publicit\u00e9 num\u00e9rique du Canada (DAAC)---Health-related ad targeting. In the United States, we provide interest-based advertising based on a limited number of standard, non-sensitive health-related interest categories, including allergies, arthritis, cholesterol, cold and flu, diabetes, gastrointestinal health, headache / migraine, healthy eating, healthy heart, men\u2019s health, oral health, osteoporosis, skin health, sleep, and vision / eye care. We will also target ads based on custom, non-sensitive health-related interest categories as requested by advertisers.---Children and advertising. We do not deliver interest-based advertising to children whose birthdate in their Microsoft account identifies them as under 16 years of age.---Data retention. For interest-based advertising, we retain data for no more than 13 months, unless we obtain your consent to retain the data longer.---Data sharing. In some cases, we share with advertisers reports about the data we have collected on their sites or ads. Data collected by other advertising companies. Advertisers sometimes include their own web beacons (or those of their other advertising partners) within their advertisements that we display, enabling them to set and read their own cookie. Additionally, Microsoft partners with third-party ad companies to help provide some of our advertising services, and we also allow other third-party ad companies to display advertisements on our sites. These third parties may place cookies on your computer and collect data about your online activities across websites or online services. These companies currently include, but are not limited to: A9, AppNexus, Criteo, Facebook, MediaMath, nugg.adAG, Oath, Rocket Fuel, and Yahoo!. Select any of the preceding links to find more information on each company's practices, including the choices it offers. Many of these companies are also members of the NAI or DAA, which each provide a simple way to opt out of ad targeting from participating companies.Collection of data from childrenmaincollectionofdatafromchildrenmoduleSummary\r\n    When a Microsoft product collects age, and there is an age in your jurisdiction under which parental consent or authorization is required to use the product, the product will either block users under that age or will ask them to provide consent or authorization from a parent or guardian before they can use it. We will not knowingly ask children under that age to provide more data than is necessary to provide for the product.\r\n\r\n    Once parental consent or authorization is granted, the child's account is treated much like any other account. The child can access communication services, like Outlook and Skype, and can freely communicate and share data with other users of all ages.\r\n    Parents can change or revoke the consent choices previously made, and review, edit, or request the deletion of the personal data of children for whom they provided consent or authorization. For example, parents can access their personal Microsoft account and select Permissions. For users of Minecraft for PC/Java and other Mojang games, parents can visit the Mojang Account page.Preview or free-of-charge releasesmainpreviewreleasesmoduleSummaryMicrosoft offers preview, insider, beta or other free-of-charge products and features (\"previews\") to enable you to evaluate them while providing Microsoft with data about your use of the product, including feedback and device and usage data. As a result, previews can automatically collect additional data, provide fewer controls, and otherwise employ different privacy and security measures than those typically present in our products. If you participate in previews, we may contact you about your feedback or your interest in continuing to use the product after general release.Changes to this privacy statementmainchangestothisprivacystatementmoduleSummary\r\n    We update this privacy statement when necessary to provide greater transparency or in response to:---Feedback from customer, regulators, industry, or other stakeholders.---Changes in our products.---Changes in our data processing activities or policies.\r\n    When we post changes to this statement, we will revise the \"last updated\" date at the top of the statement and describe the changes on the Change history page. If there are material changes to the statement, such as a change to the purposes of processing of personal data that is not consistent with the purpose for which it was originally collected, we will notify you either by prominently posting a notice of such changes before they take effect or by directly sending you a notification. We encourage you to periodically review this privacy statement to learn how Microsoft is protecting your information.How to contact usmainhowtocontactusmoduleSummaryIf you have a privacy concern, complaint, or question for the Microsoft Chief Privacy Officer or EU Data Protection Officer, please contact us by using our web form.

They include:\r\n---Cloud services, referred to as Online Services in the Microsoft Online Services Terms (OST), such as Office 365, Microsoft Azure, Microsoft Dynamics365, Microsoft Intune, and Microsoft Azure Stack, for which an organization (our customer) contracts with Microsoft for the services (\u201cEnterprise Online Services\u201d). ---Other enterprise and developer cloud-based services, such as PlayFab Services. ---Server and developer products, such as Windows Server, SQL Server, Visual Studio, and System Center (\u201cEnterprise and Developer Software\u201d).---Appliances and hardware used for storage infrastructure, such as StorSimple (\u201cEnterprise Appliances\u201d).---Developer services such as Bot Framework, Cortana Skills Kit, and Botlet Store.---Professional services referred to in the OST that are available with Enterprise Online Services, such as onboarding services, data migration services, data science services, or services to supplement existing features in the Enterprise Online Services.In the event of a conflict between this Microsoft privacy statement and the terms of any agreement(s) between a customer and Microsoft for Enterprise and Developer Products, the terms of those agreement(s) will control.You can also learn more about our Enterprise and Developer Products\u2019 features and settings, including choices that impact your privacy or your end users\u2019 privacy, in product documentation.\r\n    If any of the terms below are not defined in this Privacy Statement or the OST, they have the definitions below.\r\nGeneral. When a customer tries, purchases, uses, or subscribes to Enterprise and Developer Products, or obtains support for or professional services with such products, Microsoft collects data to provide the service (including uses compatible with providing the service), provide the best experiences with our products, operate our business, and communicate with the customer. For example:\r\n---When a customer engages with a Microsoft sales representative, we collect the customer\u2019s name and contact data, along with information about the customer\u2019s organization, to support that engagement.---When a customer interacts with a Microsoft support professional, we collect device and usage data or error reports to diagnose and resolve problems.---When a customer pays for products, we collect contact and payment data to process the payment.---When Microsoft sends communications to a customer, we use data to personalize the content of the communication.---When a customer engages with Microsoft for professional services, we collect the name and contact data of the customer\u2019s designated point of contact and use information provided by the customer to perform the services that the customer has requested.\r\n    The Enterprise and Developer Products enable you to purchase, subscribe to, or use other products and online services from Microsoft or third parties with different privacy practices, and those other products and online services are governed by their respective privacy statements and policies.\r\nEnterprise online servicesmainenterpriseservicesmoduleSummary\r\n    To provide the Enterprise Online Services, Microsoft collects Customer Data, Administrator Data, Payment Data, and Support Data.\r\n\r\n    We use Customer Data, Support Data, and Personal Data as described in the OST and the Microsoft Trust Center. Customer is the controller of Personal Data and Microsoft is the processor of such data, except when (a) Customer acts as a processor of Personal Data, in which case Microsoft is a subprocessor or (b) stated otherwise in the OST.Administrator Data is the information provided to Microsoft during sign-up, purchase, or administration of Enterprise Online Services. We use Administrator Data to provide the Enterprise Online Services, complete transactions, service the account, detect and prevent fraud, and comply with our legal obligations. Administrator Data includes the name, address, phone number, and email address you provide, as well as aggregated usage data related to your account, such as the controls you select. Administrator Data also includes contact information of your colleagues and friends if you agree to provide it to Microsoft for the limited purpose of sending them \r\n    an invitation to use the Enterprise Online Services; we contact those individuals with communications that include information about you, such as your name and profile photo.\r\n    As needed, we use Administrator Data to contact you to provide information about your account, subscriptions, billing, and updates to the Enterprise Online Services, including information about new features, security, or other technical issues. We also contact you regarding third-party inquiries we receive regarding use of the Enterprise Online Services, as described in your agreement. You cannot unsubscribe from these non-promotional communications. We may also contact you regarding information and offers about other products and services, or share your contact information with Microsoft's partners. When such a partner has specific services or solutions to meet your needs, or to optimize your use of the Enterprise Online Services, we may share limited, aggregated information about your organization\u2019s account with the partner. Microsoft will not share your confidential information or contact information with the authorized partner unless we have sufficient rights to do so. You can manage \r\n    your contact preferences or update your information in your account profile.\r\n    We use payment data to complete transactions, as well as to detect and prevent fraud.\r\n    Some Enterprise Online Services require, or are enhanced by, the installation of local software (e.g., agents, device management applications) on a device. At your direction, the local software may transmit (i) data, which can include Customer Data, from a device or appliance to or from the Enterprise Online Services; or (ii) logs or error reports to Microsoft for troubleshooting purposes. The Enterprise Online Services, including local software, collect device and usage data that is transmitted to Microsoft and analyzed to improve the quality, security, and integrity of our products.Bing Search Services, as defined in the OST, use data such as search queries as described in the Bing section of this privacy statement.\r\nEnterprise and developer software and enterprise appliancesmainenterprisedevsoftwareappsmoduleSummaryEnterprise and developer software and enterprise appliances collect data to operate effectively and provide you the best experiences. The data we collect depends on the features you use, as well as your configuration and settings, but it is generally limited to device and usage data. Customers have choices about the data they provide. Here are examples of the data we collect:---During installation or when you upgrade an enterprise and developer software, we may collect device and usage data to learn whether you experience any difficulties.---When you use enterprise software or enterprise appliances, we may collect device and usage data to learn about your operating environment to improve security features.---When you experience a crash using enterprise software or enterprise appliances, you may choose to send Microsoft an error report to help us diagnose the problem and deliver customer support.\r\n    Microsoft uses the data we collect from enterprise and developer software and enterprise appliances to provide and improve our products, to deliver customer support, to activate the product, to communicate with you, and to operate our business.\r\n\r\n    Microsoft SQL Server is a relational database management platform and includes products that can be installed separately (such as SQL Server Management Studio). For detailed information about what data we collect, how we use it, and how to manage your privacy options, visit the  \r\n    SQL Server privacy page. \r\n    If you work in an organization, your administrator can set certain telemetry settings in SQL Server via Group Policy.\r\nProductivity and communications productsmainprodcommproductsmoduleSummaryProductivity and communications products are applications, software, and services you can use to create, store, and share documents, as well as communicate with others.OfficemainofficeservicesmoduleSummary\r\n    Office is a collection of productivity services and applications including Word, Excel, PowerPoint, and Outlook, among others. For more details about Outlook, see the Outlook section of this privacy statement. Office is a service that is comprised of client software applications and connected online services that span many platforms and have numerous interdependent experiences. Various Office services enable you to use your file content for designs and recommendations, collaborate with others within your documents, and provide you functionality from other Microsoft products, such as Bing and third-party connected products. If you work in an organization, your administrator may turn off or disable these connected services. Prior to Office 365 version 1904, you can change your privacy settings in the Privacy Options of the Microsoft Office Trust Center. For more information, see View my options and settings in the Microsoft Office Trust Center. Starting with Version 1904 of Office 365, \r\n    you can access new, updated, and improved privacy controls by selecting File > Account > Account Privacy. See Account Privacy Settings for more information.\r\nOffice Roaming Service. The Office Roaming Service helps keep your Office settings up to date across your devices running Office. When you sign in to Office with your Microsoft account or an account issued by your organization, the Office Client Policy Service is turned on and syncs some of your customized Office settings to Microsoft servers (such as a list of most recently used documents and the last location viewed within a document). When you sign in to Office on another device with the same account, the Office Roaming Service downloads your settings from Microsoft servers and applies them to the additional device. The Office Roaming Service also applies some of your customized Office settings when you sign in to Office.com. When you sign out of Office, the Office Roaming Service removes your Office settings from your device. Any changes you made to your customized Office settings are sent to Microsoft servers.Microsoft Updates. Office uses either Microsoft Update or Click-to-Run services to provide you with security and other important updates. See the Update Services section of this privacy statement for more information about Microsoft Update.Click-to-Run Update Service. The Click-to-Run Update Service allows you to install certain Microsoft Office products over the internet. The Click-to-Run Update Service also automatically detects online updates to Click-to-Run-enabled products on your device and downloads and installs them automatically.Diagnostic Data. Diagnostic data is used to (i) keep Office secure and up to date; (ii) detect, diagnose, and remediate problems; and (iii) make product improvements. This data does not include a user's name or email address, the content of the user's files, or information about apps unrelated to Office. Users have a choice between two different levels of diagnostic data collection, Required and Optional. ---Required. The minimum data necessary to help keep Office secure, up to date, and performing as expected on the device it's installed on.\r\n        ---Optional. Additional data that helps us make product improvements and provides enhanced information to help us detect, diagnose, and remediate issues.\r\n    See Diagnostic Data in Office for more information.\r\nConnected Experiences. Office continues to provide more experiences in client applications that are connected to and backed by cloud-based services. In order to ensure that all these connected experiences will be reliable, up to date, remain secure, and perform as expected, necessary service data may be collected whenever you use a connected experience.\r\n\r\n    Office consists of client software applications and connected experiences designed to enable you to create, communicate, and collaborate more effectively. Working with others on a document stored on OneDrive for Business or translating the contents of a Word document into a different language are examples of connected experiences. There are two types of connected experiences. ---Experiences that analyze your content. Experiences that use your Office content to provide you with design recommendations, editing suggestions, data insights, and similar features. For example, PowerPoint Designer or Editor in Word.---Experiences that download online content. Experiences that allow you to search and download online content including templates, images, 3D models, videos, and reference materials to enhance your documents. For example, Office templates or PowerPoint QuickStarter. \r\n    Prior to Office 365 version 1904, you can change your privacy settings in the Privacy Options of the Microsoft Office Trust Center.\r\n    Starting with Version 1904 of Office 365, you can access new, updated, and improved privacy controls by selecting File > Account > Account Privacy. These privacy settings allow you to configure your connected experiences. For example, you can choose to enable connected experiences that download online content, but not connected experiences that analyze content. Turning off connected experiences will also turn off additional experiences, such as document co-authoring and online file storage. But even if you use this privacy setting to turn off connected experiences, certain Office functionality will remain available, such as syncing your mailbox in Outlook, as well as essential services described below.\r\n\r\n    If you choose to disable certain types of connected experiences, either the ribbon or menu command for those connected experiences will be grayed out or you will get an error message when you try to use those connected experiences.\r\n\r\n    There are a set of services that are essential to how Office functions and cannot be disabled. For example, the licensing service that confirms that you are properly licensed to use Office is essential. Necessary service data about these services is collected and sent to Microsoft, regardless of any other settings that you have configured. See\r\nEssential Services for more information. Necessary service data for connected experiences\r\n    Necessary service data is data that enables us to deliver cloud-based connected experiences and help make these experiences secure and perform as expected. There are three types of information that are considered as necessary service data. ---Customer Content, which is content you create using Office, such as text typed in a Word document. ---Functional Data, which includes information needed by a connected experience to perform its task, such as configuration information about the app. ---Service Diagnostic Data, which is the data necessary to keep the service secure, up to date, and performing as expected. Because this data is strictly related to the connected experience, it is separate from Required or Optional diagnostic data levels. \r\n    To help you understand necessary service data, the following is an example scenario using PowerPoint Designer, which is a connected experience you can use when creating slides for a presentation. PowerPoint Designer helps you improve your slides by automatically generating design ideas to choose from. While you're putting content on a slide, Designer works in the background to match that content to professionally designed layouts. \r\n    The necessary service data that is sent to Microsoft to enable this connected experience for you could include the following: ---Customer content, such as the text or images you added to your slide. ---Functional data, such as which slide you are working on and its layout. ---Service diagnostic data, such as events that tell us if the design idea was correctly applied to your slide and that the service calls were performing correctly. \r\n    If you choose to disable the category of connected experiences that includes PowerPoint Designer, the feature will be turned off and none of this necessary service data is sent to us. See Connected Experiences in Office for more information OneDrivemainonedrivemoduleSummary\r\n    OneDrive lets you store and access your files on virtually any device. You can also share and collaborate on your files with others. Some versions of the OneDrive application enable you to access both your personal OneDrive by signing in with your personal Microsoft account and your OneDrive for Business by signing in with your work or school Microsoft account as part of your organization's use of Office 365.\r\n\r\n    When you use OneDrive, we collect data about your usage of the service, as well as the content you store, to provide, improve, and protect the services. Examples include indexing the contents of your OneDrive documents so that you can search for them later and using location information to enable you to search for photos based on where the photo was taken. We also collect device information so we can deliver personalized experiences, such as enabling you to sync content across devices and roam customized settings.\r\n\r\n    When you store content in OneDrive, that content will inherit the sharing permissions of the folder in which you store it. For example, if you decide to store content in the public folder, the content will be public and available to anyone on the internet who can find the folder. If you store content in a private folder, the content will be private.\r\n\r\n    When you share content to a social network like Facebook from a device that you have synced with your OneDrive account, your content is either uploaded to that social network, or a link to that content is posted to that social network. Doing this makes the content accessible to anyone on that social network. To delete the content, you need to delete it from the social network (if it was uploaded there, rather than a link to it) and from OneDrive.\r\n\r\n    When you share your OneDrive content with your friends via a link, an email with the link is sent to those friends. The link contains an authorization code that allows anyone with the link to access your content. If one of your friends sends the link to other people, they will also be able to access your content, even if you did not choose to share the content with them. To revoke permissions for your content on OneDrive, sign in to your account and then select the specific content to manage the permission levels. Revoking permissions for a link effectively deactivates the link. No one will be able to use the link to access the content unless you decide to share the link again.\r\n\r\n    Files managed with OneDrive for Business are stored separately from files stored with your personal OneDrive. OneDrive for Business collects and transmits personal data for authentication, such as your email address and password, which will be transmitted to Microsoft and/or to the provider of your Office 365 service.\r\nOutlookmainoutlookmoduleSummaryOutlook products are designed to improve your productivity through improved communications and include Outlook.com, Outlook applications, and related services.Outlook.com. Outlook.com is the primary consumer email service from Microsoft and includes email accounts with addresses that end in outlook.com, live.com, hotmail.com, and msn.com. Outlook.com provides features that let you connect with your friends on social networks. You will need to create a Microsoft account to use Outlook.com.When you delete an email or item from a mailbox in Outlook.com, the item generally goes into your Deleted Items folder where it remains for approximately 7 days unless you move it back to your inbox, you empty the folder, or the service empties the folder automatically, whichever comes first. When the Deleted Items folder is emptied, those emptied items remain in our system for up to 30 days before final deletion, unless we are legally required to retain the data for longer.Outlook applications. Outlook client applications are software you install on your device that permits you to manage email, calendar items, files, contacts, and other data from email, file storage, and other services, like Exchange Online or Outlook.com, or servers, like Microsoft Exchange. You can use multiple accounts from different providers, including third-party providers, with Outlook applications.To add an account, you must provide permission for Outlook to access data from the email or file storage services.When you add an account to Outlook, your mail, calendar items, files, contacts, settings and other data from that account will automatically sync to your device. If you are using the mobile Outlook application, that data will also sync to Microsoft servers to enable additional features such as faster search, personalized filtering of less important mail, and an ability to add email attachments from linked file storage providers without leaving the Outlook application. If you are using the desktop Outlook application, you can choose whether to allow the data to sync to our servers. At any time, you can remove an account or make changes to the data that is synced from your account.If you add an account provided by an organization (such as your employer or school), the owner of the organizational domain can implement policies and controls (for example, requiring multi-factor authentication or the ability to remotely wipe data from your device) that can affect your use of Outlook.To learn more about the data the Outlook applications collect and process, please see the Office section of this privacy statement.SkypemainskypemoduleSummary\r\n    Skype lets you send and receive voice, video, and instant message communications. This section applies to the consumer version of Skype; if you are using Skype for Business, see the Enterprise and developer products section of this privacy statement.\r\n\r\n    As part of providing these features, Microsoft collects usage data about your communications that includes the time and date of the communication and the numbers or user names that are part of the communication.\r\nSkype profile. Your Skype profile includes information you provided when you set up a Microsoft account. To enable other people to find you on Skype (or products that interact with Skype, such as Skype for Business), depending on your profile settings, your Skype profile is included in the Skype public search directory and may be recommended to other users. Your profile includes your user name, avatar, and any other data you choose to add to your profile or display to others.\r\nSkype Contacts. If you use a Microsoft service, such as Outlook.com, to manage contacts, Skype will automatically add the people you know to your Skype contact list until you tell us to stop. With your permission, Skype will also check your device or other address books from time to time to automatically add your friends as Skype contacts. You can block users if you don\u2019t want to receive their communications.\r\nPartner companies. To make Skype available to more people, we partner with other companies to allow Skype to be offered via those companies\u2019 services. If you use Skype through a company other than Microsoft, that company\u2019s privacy policy governs how it handles your data. To comply with applicable law or respond to valid legal process, or to help our partner company or local operator comply or respond, we may access, transfer, disclose, and preserve your data. That data could include, for example, your private content, such as the content of your instant messages, stored video messages, voicemails, or file transfers.\r\nSkype Manager. Skype Manager lets you manage a group\u2019s (such as your family\u2019s) Skype usage from one central place. When you set up a group, you will be the Skype Manager Administrator and can see the patterns of usage, including detailed information, like traffic data and details of purchases, of other members of the group who have consented to such access. If you add information like your name, other people in the group will be able to see it. Members of the group can withdraw consent for Skype Manager by visiting their Skype account page.\r\nPush notifications. To let you know of incoming calls, chats, and other messages, Skype apps use the notification service on your device. For many devices, these services are provided by another company. To tell you who is calling, for example, or to give you the first few words of the new chat, Skype has to tell the notification service so that they can provide the notification to you. The company providing the notification service on your device will use this information in accordance with their own terms and privacy policy. Microsoft is not responsible for the data collected by the company providing the notification service. If you don\u2019t want to use the notification services for incoming Skype calls and messages, turn it off in the settings found in the Skype application or your device.\r\nSkype advertising. Some Skype software includes interest-based advertising, so that you\u2019re more likely to see ads you\u2019ll like. In some versions of the software, you can opt out of interest-based advertising in the privacy options or account settings menu. If you sign in to Skype with a Microsoft account, you can opt out of interest-based advertising on the Microsoft privacy dashboard. If you opt out, you\u2019ll still see ads displayed in the Skype software based on your country of residence, language preference, and IP address location, but other data is not used for ad targeting.\r\nTranslation features. To help you communicate with people in different languages, some Skype apps offer audio and/or text translation features. When you use translation features, your voice and text data are used to provide and improve Microsoft speech recognition and translation services.\r\nRecording features. Some versions of Skype have a recording feature that allows you to capture and share all or part of your audio / video call. The recording will be stored and shared as part of your conversation history with the person or group with whom the call occurred. You should understand your legal responsibilities before recording any communication. This includes whether you need to get consent from all parties to the communication in advance. Microsoft is not responsible for how you use your recordings or the recording features.\r\nSkype bots. Bots are programs offered by Microsoft or third parties that can do many useful things like search for news, play games, and more. Depending on their capabilities, bots may have access to your display name, Skype ID, country, region, language, and any messages, audio, video, or content that you share with the bot. Please review the bot profile and its privacy statement before engaging in a one-to-one or group conversation with a bot. You can delete a bot that you no longer wish to engage with. Prior to adding a bot to a group, please ensure that your group participants have consented to their information being shared with the bot.\r\nCortana in Skype. Subject to availability, you can use Cortana in Skype to help manage your time and tasks, find information, and get things done using Microsoft and third-party services. Cortana works best when you give her permission to use data, such as your location and IM conversations from Skype to personalize experiences across Microsoft products that offer Cortana functionality. If you choose not to give permission, Cortana may still provide you with non-personalized suggestions and responses within Skype.\r\nCaptioning. Certain Skype features include accessibility functionality such as captioning. During Skype calls, a call participant can activate a voice-to-text feature, which allows the user to view the audio chat as text. If a user activates this feature, other call participants will not receive a notification. Microsoft uses this voice and text data to provide captioning of audio for users and to improve Microsoft speech recognition and related services.\r\nLinkedInmainlinkedinmoduleSummaryTo learn about the data LinkedIn collects and how it is used and shared, please see LinkedIn\u2019s Privacy Policy.Search and artificial intelligencemainsearchaimoduleSummarySearch and artificial intelligence products connect you with information and intelligently sense, process, and act on information\u2014learning and adapting over time.BingmainbingmoduleSummary\r\n    Bing services include search and mapping services, as well as the Bing Toolbar and Bing Desktop apps. Bing services collect and process data in many forms, including text that has been inked or typed, speech data, and images. Bing services are also included within other Microsoft services, such as MSN Apps, Office, Cortana, and certain features in Windows (which we refer to as Bing-powered experiences).\r\n\r\n    When you conduct a search, or use a feature of a Bing-powered experience that involves conducting a search or entering a command on your behalf, Microsoft will collect the searches or commands you provide (which may be in the form of text, voice data, or an image), along with your IP address, location, the unique identifiers contained in our cookies or similar technologies, the time and date of your search, and your browser configuration. For example, if you use Bing voice-enabled services, your voice input and performance data associated with the speech functionality will be sent to Microsoft. And, if you use Bing image-enabled services, the image you provide will be sent to Microsoft. When you use Bing-powered experiences, such as Ask Cortana or Bing Lookup to search a particular word or phrase within a webpage or document, that word or phrase is sent to Bing along with some surrounding content in order to provide contextually relevant search results.\r\nSearch suggestions. For the search suggestions feature, the characters that you type into a Bing-powered experience to conduct a search will be sent to Microsoft. This allows us to provide you with suggestions as you type your searches. To turn this feature on or off, while using Bing Search, go to Bing Settings. Search Suggestions cannot be turned off in Cortana. On Windows, you can always hide Cortana and the search box so as not to use the feature.\r\nBing experience improvement program for Bing Desktop and Bing Toolbar. If you are using Bing Desktop or Bing Toolbar and choose to participate in the Bing Experience Improvement Program, we also collect additional data about how you use these specific Bing apps, such as the addresses of the websites you visit, to help improve search ranking and relevance. To help protect your privacy, we do not use the data collected through the Bing Experience Improvement Program to identify or contact you or target advertising to you. You can turn off the Bing Experience Improvement Program at any time in the Bing Desktop or Bing Toolbar settings. Finally, we delete the information collected through the Bing Experience Improvement Program after 18 months.\r\nRetention and de-identification. We de-identify stored search queries by removing the entirety of the IP address after 6 months, and cookie IDs and other cross-session identifiers after 18 months.\r\nPersonalization through Microsoft account. Some Bing services provide you with an enhanced experience when you sign in with your personal Microsoft account, for example, syncing your search history across devices. You can use these personalization features to customize your interests, favorites, and settings, and to connect your account with third-party services. Visit Bing Settings to manage your personalization settings, or the Microsoft privacy dashboard to manage your data.\r\nManaging search history. When you\u2019re signed-in to a personal Microsoft account, you can erase your search history on the Microsoft privacy dashboard. The Search History service from Bing, located in Bing Settings, provides another method of revisiting the search terms you've entered and results you've clicked when using Bing search through your browser. You may clear your search history on a device through this service. Clearing your history prevents that history from being displayed on the Search History site, but does not delete information from our search logs, which are retained and de-identified as described above or as you have instructed through the privacy dashboard.\r\nThird-party services that use Bing. You may access Bing-powered experiences when using third-party services, such as those from Yahoo!. In order to provide these services, Bing receives data from these and other partners, including your search query and related data (such as date, time, IP address, and a unique identifier). This data will be sent to Microsoft to provide the search service. Microsoft will use this data as described in this statement or as further limited by our contractual obligations with our partners. You should refer to the privacy policies of the third-party services for any questions about how they collect and use data.\r\nSearch query passed in referral URL. When you select a search result or advertisement from a Bing search results page and go to the destination website, the destination website will receive the standard data your browser sends to every web site you visit\u2014such as your IP address, browser type and language, and the URL of the site you came from (in this case, the Bing search results page). Because the URL of the Bing search results page contains the text of the search query you entered (which could include names, addresses, or other identifying information), the destination website will be able to determine the search term you entered.\r\n\r\n    If your browser is enabled to allow pages to pre-load in the background for faster performance, when your browser loads a page in the background, it will have the same effect as if you visited that page, including sending the Bing search results page URL (containing your search query) and downloading any cookies or similar technologies that page sets.\r\nSharing data from Bing and Bing-powered experiences with third parties. We share some de-identified data (data where the identity of a specific person is not known) from Bing and Bing-powered experiences with selected third parties. Before we do so, we run the data through a process designed to remove certain sensitive data that users may have included in the search terms themselves (such as social security numbers or credit card numbers). Additionally, we require these third parties to keep the data secure and to not use the data for purposes other than for which it is provided.\r\nCortanamaincortanamoduleSummary\r\n    Cortana is your intelligent assistant that provides smart features and personalized experiences across a variety of devices, apps, and services. As described below, the data we collect when you use Cortana depends on the choices you make (including your privacy settings and whether or not you are signed-in), the data you share with Cortana, and Cortana\u2019s capabilities (which vary depending on your operating system, device, and the services and apps you use). Cortana works best when you sign in and let her use data from your device, your Microsoft account, other Microsoft services, and third-party services to which you choose to connect.\r\n\r\n    You can manage what data Cortana uses, and what she knows about you in Cortana Settings, Permissions, and Notebook. More about Cortana\u2019s features and how to manage them can be found at Cortana and privacy.\r\n    The data Cortana collects is used to provide, improve, personalize, and develop Cortana and other Microsoft products. For example:---Cortana uses information about your interests to recommend features you may enjoy.---Cortana shares information with third parties at your direction to complete a task or transaction you\u2019ve requested, such as making a restaurant reservation or booking a ride share service.---Microsoft uses your voice data to improve speech recognition and user intent understanding to improve Cortana and other Microsoft products.\r\n    On Windows devices, if you choose not to sign in to Cortana, you can still chat with Cortana and use Cortana to search, using either your voice, inking, or typing. For more information, see the Windows Search section of this privacy statement. If you choose not to sign in to Cortana on Skype, you can still receive non-personalized suggestions and responses within Skype. See the Skype section of this privacy statement for more information.\r\n\r\n    When you use Cortana when you are signed out, we collect:---Voice data. To help Cortana better understand the way you speak and your voice commands, we collect voice data and use it to build speech models and improve speech recognition and user intent understanding. If you choose to sign in, the speech models are more personalized.---Searches and commands. We collect your searches and commands to provide, improve, and develop Cortana and other products. Your Bing search queries and the Search Suggestion feature, even if Cortana does the searching for you, are treated like any other Bing search queries and are used as described in the Bing section of this privacy statement.---Device and usage data. We collect information about your device as well as the hardware and software you use. For example, Cortana can access data about your device and how you use it. For instance, Cortana can determine if Bluetooth is on, whether you\u2019ve locked your screen, your alarm settings, and which apps you install and use.\r\n    If you sign in with your Microsoft account, you can enable Cortana to perform additional tasks and to provide personalized experiences and suggestions. Cortana can process the demographic data (such as your age, postal code, and gender) associated with your Microsoft account and data collected through other Microsoft services to provide personalized suggestions. For example, Cortana uses data collected by the Sports app to automatically display information about the teams you follow. Cortana also learns your favorite places from the Microsoft Maps app, and what you view and purchase in Microsoft Store to improve her suggestions. Your interests in Cortana's Notebook can be used by other Microsoft services, such as Bing or MSN, to customize your interests, preferences, and favorites in those experiences as well.\r\n    When you sign in to Cortana, in addition to the information described above, we also collect:Location data. You can choose whether Cortana processes your location information to give you the most relevant notices and results and to make suggestions that help save you time, such as local traffic information and location-based reminders. If you grant permission, Cortana will regularly collect and use your current location, location history, and other location signals (such as locations tagged on photos you upload to OneDrive). Location data Cortana collects is used to provide you with personalized experiences across our products, such as making Bing search results more relevant. It may also be used in de-identified form to improve the Windows Location Services. See more details in the Location services section of this privacy statement.Contacts, communications, and other inputs. You can choose to let Cortana collect and access your device and cloud-based email and other communications, your calendar, and your contacts to enable additional features and personalization. If you give permission, Cortana will collect and process additional data, including:---Contacts, text messages, and email. Cortana uses your contacts and messages to do a variety of things, such as: making calls when Cortana is connected to Skype, allowing you to add events to your calendar, apprising you of important messages or important contacts, and keeping you up to date on events or other things that are important to you, like package tracking. Cortana also uses your contacts and messages to help you with planning around your events and offers other helpful suggestions and recommendations.---Communications history. Cortana learns who is most important to you by analyzing your call, text message, and email history. Cortana uses this data to keep track of people most relevant to you and your preferred methods of communication, flag important messages for you (such as missed calls), and improve the performance of Cortana features, such as speech recognition.---Calendar appointments. Cortana uses your calendars to provide reminders and information relevant to your appointments.Browse history. If you choose, Cortana can use your Microsoft Edge browse history associated with your Microsoft account. Cortana uses this data to learn about you and provide you with intelligent answers and timely, personalized suggestions, or to complete web tasks for you. Cortana can also help you pick up where you left off on one device when browsing in Microsoft Edge on another device. Cortana won\u2019t collect information about sites you visit in InPrivate tabs.Connected services and Skills. To enable greater personalization and productivity, you can give Cortana permission to (i) collect data from other Microsoft and third-party services, and (ii) share your information with those services. When you enable data sharing, Cortana shares your requests and responses with those services or third parties to enable your commands. With your permission, Cortana may also share additional information (e.g., your location). Information you share with a third party is governed by the third party\u2019s privacy policy and terms. Cortana also uses data about your use of Connected services and Skills to improve and develop Cortana and other Microsoft products. For example, we use this data, including your query sent to the third party, to improve speech recognition and user-intent understanding within Microsoft products, especially Cortana. Below are examples of how your data is processed when you use Connected services and Skills:\r\n---If you choose to connect Cortana to your work or school account, Cortana can access data stored in Office 365 to help you stay up to date, manage your email and calendar, and get insights about your meetings and relationships. ---Choosing to sign in to LinkedIn within Cortana allows Microsoft to access your LinkedIn data so Cortana can give you more personalized information and recommendations. Please note that Cortana enables LinkedIn to access the name, email address, job title, and company name of people are you are meeting with, so she can retrieve relevant information about those contacts.---Cortana allows you to connect to third-party services to enable her to do more and provide additional personalized experiences based upon data from the third-party service. Not all Skills require your authentication. With your permission, Cortana can also send information about you along with your request to certain third-parties. For instance, when you ask Cortana to request you a ride, Cortana will send Uber your request along with your current location and destination.Microsoft TranslatormainMicrosoftTranslatormoduleSummaryMicrosoft Translator is a machine translation system designed to automatically translate text and speech between numerous supported languages.Microsoft Translator (which includes apps for Android, iOS, Windows, Translator Hub, Translator for Bing, and Translator for Microsoft Edge, collectively \u201cTranslator\u201d) processes the text, image, and speech data you submit, as well as device and usage data. We use this data to provide Translator, personalize your experiences, and improve our products. Microsoft has implemented business and technical measures designed to help de identify the data you submit to Translator. For example, when we randomly sample text to improve Translator, we delete identifiers and certain text, such as email addresses and some number sequences, detected in the sample that could contain personal data.For more information on the Cognitive Services Translator Text API, Custom Translator, and Translator Speech API, see the Enterprise and developer products section of this privacy statement. For the Translate feature in Office, see the Productivity and communications products section of this privacy statement.SwiftKeymainswiftkeymoduleSummary\r\n    SwiftKey Keyboard and related products (collectively, the \u201cSwiftKey Services\u201d) process data about how you type and write, and use this data to learn your writing style and provide personalized autocorrection and predictive text that adapts to you. We also use this data to offer a range of other features, such as hashtag and emoji prediction.\r\n\r\n    SwiftKey prediction technology learns from the way you use language to build a personalized language model. This model is an optimized view of the words and phrases that you use most often in context and reflects your unique writing style. The model itself contains the words you commonly type arranged in a way to enable SwiftKey\u2019s algorithms to make predictions based on what you type. The model draws from all scenarios in which you use your keyboard, including when you type while using apps or visiting websites. The SwiftKey keyboard and model attempts to avoid collecting sensitive data, such as fields flagged as containing password or payment data. SwiftKey Services do not log, store, or learn from data you type, or the data contained in your model, unless you choose to share your data with us (as described further below). When you use SwiftKey Services, we also collect device and usage data. We use de-identified device and usage data to analyze service performance and help improve \r\n    our products.\r\n\r\n    The SwiftKey Services also include an optional cloud component called a SwiftKey Account. If you choose to create a SwiftKey Account, your language model will be synced with the SwiftKey Account cloud service, so you can benefit from that model on the different devices you use and access additional services such as personalization, prediction synchronization, and backup. When you create a SwiftKey Account, Microsoft will also collect your email address and basic demographic data. All data collected is transferred to our servers over encrypted channels.\r\n\r\n    SwiftKey Account holders have the option to use the SwiftKey personalization service, which more quickly establishes and improves personalized predictions by allowing SwiftKey to access content on your device, including content you send through SMS, and certain apps such as Outlook.com, Gmail, Facebook and Twitter when you choose to connect them to the service.\r\n\r\n    You may also opt in to send short snippets of what and how you type for product improvement. To preserve your privacy, SwiftKey Services de-identifies these snippets, so they are not linked to your account. You can withdraw your consent to share these snippets at any time in SwiftKey Settings. You can also withdraw your consent to allow SwiftKey Services to use and retain your personal data at any time in SwiftKey Settings. When you withdraw consent, personal data collected through your use of the SwiftKey Services will be deleted.\r\n\r\n\r\n    You may receive occasional notifications on your device alerting you to product updates and features that may be of interest to you. You can disable these notifications at any time in the SwiftKey Settings.\r\nWindowsmainwindowsmoduleSummaryWindows is a personalized computing environment that enables you to seamlessly roam and access services, preferences, and content across your computing devices from phones to tablets to the Surface Hub. Rather than residing as a static software program on your device, key components of Windows are cloud-based, and both cloud and local elements of Windows are updated regularly, providing you with the latest improvements and features. In order to provide this computing experience, we collect data about you, your device, and the way you use Windows. And because Windows is personal to you, we give you choices about the personal data we collect and how we use it. Note that if your Windows device is managed by your organization (such as your employer or school), your organization may use centralized management tools provided by Microsoft or others to access and process your data and to control device settings (including privacy settings), device policies, software updates, data collection by \r\n    us or the organization, or other aspects of your device. Additionally, your organization may use management tools provided by Microsoft or others to access and process your data from that device, including your interaction data, diagnostic data, and the contents of your communications and files. For \r\n    more information about data collection and privacy in Windows, see Windows 10 and your online services. Earlier versions of Windows (including Windows Vista, Windows 7, Windows 8, and Windows 8.1) are subject to their own privacy statements. ActivationmainactivationmoduleSummaryWhen you activate Windows, a specific product key is associated with the device on which your software is installed. The product key and data about the software and your device is sent to Microsoft to help validate your license to the software. This data may be sent again if there is a need to re-activate or validate your license. On phones running Windows, device and network identifiers, as well as device location at the time of the first power-up of the device, are also sent to Microsoft for the purpose of warranty registration, stock replenishment, and fraud prevention.Activity historymainactivityhistorymoduleSummary\r\n    Activity history helps keep track of the things you do on your device, such as the apps and services you use, the files you open, and the websites you browse. Your activity history is stored locally on your device when using different apps and features such as Microsoft Edge, some Microsoft Store apps, and Office apps. If you've signed in to your device with a Microsoft account and given your permission, Windows sends your activity history to Microsoft. Once your activity history is in the cloud, Microsoft uses that data to enable cross-device experiences, to provide you with the ability to continue those activities on other devices, to provide personalized experiences (such as ordering your activities based on duration of use) and relevant suggestions (such as anticipating what your needs might be based on your activity history), and to help improve Microsoft products.\r\n\r\n    Activity history is also created and sent to Microsoft when you use Microsoft apps, such as Microsoft Edge, and Office apps like Word, Excel, and PowerPoint, on mobile devices such as iOS and Android phones and tablets. If you are signed in with your Microsoft account, you can continue activities on your Windows\u00a010 device that you started in Microsoft apps on your Android or iOS device. You can turn settings off or on for sending your activity history to Microsoft and storing activity history locally on your device, and you can also clear your device\u2019s activity history at any time by going to Start > Settings > Privacy > Activity history. Learn more about activity history in Windows 10.Advertising IDmainadvertisingidmoduleSummary\r\n    Windows generates a unique advertising ID for each person using a device, which app developers and advertising networks can then use to provide more relevant advertising in apps. When the advertising ID is enabled, both Microsoft apps and third-party apps can access and use the advertising ID in much the same way that websites can access and use a unique identifier stored in a cookie. Thus, your advertising ID can be used by app developers and advertising networks to provide more relevant advertising and other personalized experiences across their apps and on the web. Microsoft collects the advertising ID for the uses described here only when you choose to enable the advertising ID as part of your privacy setting. \r\n    The advertising ID setting applies to Windows apps using the Windows advertising identifier to provide interest-based advertising. You can turn off access to this identifier at any time by turning off the advertising ID in Settings. If you choose to turn it on again, the advertising ID will be reset and a new identifier will be generated. When a third-party app accesses the advertising ID, its use of the advertising ID will be subject to its own privacy policy. Learn more about advertising ID in Windows 10.\r\n    The advertising ID setting does not apply to other methods of interest-based advertising delivered by Microsoft or third parties, such as cookies used to provide interest-based display ads on websites. Third-party products accessed through or installed on Windows may also deliver other forms of interest-based advertising subject to their own privacy policies. Microsoft delivers other forms of interest-based ads in certain Microsoft products, both directly and by partnering with third-party ad providers. For more information on how Microsoft uses data for advertising, see the How we use personal data section of this statement. DiagnosticsmaindiagnosticsmoduleSummary\r\n    Microsoft collects Windows diagnostic data to solve problems and to keep Windows up to date, secure, and operating properly. It also helps us improve Windows and related Microsoft products and services and, for customers who have turned on the \u201cTailored experiences\u201d setting, to provide more relevant tips and recommendations to tailor Microsoft and third-party products and services for Windows to the customer\u2019s needs. This data is transmitted to Microsoft and stored with one or more unique identifiers that can help us recognize an individual user on an individual device and understand the device's service issues and use patterns. There are two levels of diagnostic and activity data: Basic and Full. If an organization (such as your employer or school) uses Microsoft management tools or engages Microsoft to manage your device, we and the organization will use and process diagnostic and error data from your device to allow the management, monitoring, and \r\n    troubleshooting of the organization's devices, and for other purposes of the organization.\r\nBasic data includes information about your device, its settings and capabilities, and whether it is performing properly. We collect the following data at the Basic level:---Device, connectivity, and configuration data:\r\n        Data about the device such as the processor type, OEM manufacturer, type of battery and capacity, number and type of cameras, firmware, and memory attributes.Network capabilities and connection data such as the device\u2019s IP address, mobile network (including IMEI and mobile operator), and whether the device is connected to a free or paid network.Data about the operating system and its configuration such as the OS version and build number, region and language settings, diagnostics level, and whether the device is part of the Windows Insider program.Data about connected peripherals such as model, manufacturer, drivers, and compatibility data.Data about the applications installed on the device such as application name, version, and publisher.---Whether a device is ready for an update and whether there are factors that may impede the ability to receive updates, such as low battery, limited disk space, or connectivity through a paid network.---Whether updates complete successfully or fail.---Data about the reliability of the diagnostics collection system itself.---Basic error reporting, which is health data about the operating system and applications running on your device. For example, basic error reporting tells us if an application, such as Microsoft Paint or a third-party game, hangs or crashes. Full data includes everything collected with Basic data, plus additional information about device health, device activity (also sometimes referred to as usage), and enhanced error reporting that helps Microsoft to fix and improve products and services for all users. We collect the following additional information at the Full level:---Additional data about the device, connectivity, and configuration, beyond that collected at Basic.---Status and logging information about the health of operating system and other system components (in addition to data about the update and diagnostics systems collected at Basic).---App activity, such as which programs are launched on a device, how long they run, and how quickly they respond to input.---Browser activity, including browsing history and search terms, in Microsoft browsers (Microsoft Edge or Internet Explorer).---Enhanced error reporting, including the memory state of the device when a system or app crash occurs (which may unintentionally contain user content, such as parts of a file you were using when the problem occurred). Crash data is never used for Tailored experiences as described below.\r\n    Some of the data described above may not be collected from your device even if your Diagnostic data setting is set to Full. Microsoft minimizes the volume of data it collects from all devices by collecting some of the data at the Full level from only a subset of devices (sample). By running the Diagnostic Data Viewer tool, you can see an icon which indicates whether your device is part of a sample and also which specific data is collected from your device. Instructions for how to download the Diagnostic Data Viewer tool can be found at Start > Settings > Privacy > Diagnostics & feedback.\r\n    Specific data items collected in Windows diagnostics are subject to change to give Microsoft flexibility to collect the data needed for the purposes described. For example, to ensure Microsoft can troubleshoot the latest performance issue impacting users\u2019 computing experience or update a Windows 10 device that is new to the market, Microsoft may need to collect data items that were not collected previously. For a current list of data types collected at both levels of diagnostics, see Windows 10 diagnostic data at the Full level or Windows 10 diagnostic data at the Basic level for the current list of data collected at Basic. We provide limited portions of error report information to partners (such as the device manufacturer) to help them troubleshoot products and services which work with Windows and other Microsoft product and services. They are only permitted to use this information to repair or improve those products and services. We may also share some aggregated, de-identified \r\n    diagnostic data, such as general usage trends for Windows apps and features, with selected third parties. Learn more about diagnostic data in Windows 10.Inking and typing Recognition. You also can choose to help Microsoft improve inking and typing recognition by sending inking and typing diagnostic data. If you choose to do so, Microsoft will collect samples of the content you type or write to improve features such as handwriting recognition, autocompletion, next word prediction, and spelling correction in the many languages used by Windows customers. When Microsoft collects inking and typing diagnostic data, it is divided into small samples and processed to remove unique identifiers, sequencing information, and other data (such as email addresses and numeric values) which could be used to reconstruct the original content or associate the input to you. It also includes associated performance data, such as changes you manually make to text, as well as words you've added to the dictionary. Learn more about improving inking and typing in Windows 10.\r\n    If you choose to turn on Tailored experiences, we will use your Windows diagnostic data (Basic or Full as you have selected) to offer you personalized tips, ads, and recommendations to enhance Microsoft products and services for your needs. If you have selected Basic as your diagnostic data setting, personalization is based on information about your device, its settings and capabilities, and whether it is performing properly. If you have selected Full, personalization is also based on information about the websites you browse, how you use apps and features, plus additional information about the health of your device. However, we do not use the content of crash dumps, speech, typing, or inking input data for personalization when we receive such data from customers who have selected Full.\r\n\r\n    Tailored experiences include suggestions on how to customize and optimize Windows, as well as ads and recommendations for Microsoft and third-party products and services, features, apps, and hardware for your Windows experiences. For example, to help you get the most out of your device, we may tell you about features you may not know about or that are new. If you are having a problem with your Windows device, you may be offered a solution. You may be offered a chance to customize your lock screen with pictures, or to be shown more pictures of the kind you like, or fewer of the ones you don\u2019t. If you stream movies in your browser, you may be recommended an app from the Microsoft Store that streams more efficiently. Or, if you are running out of space on your hard drive, Windows may recommend you try OneDrive or purchase hardware to gain more space. Learn more about tailored experiences in Windows 10.Feedback HubmainfeedbackhubmoduleSummary\r\n    Feedback Hub is a preinstalled app that provides a way to gather feedback on Microsoft products and installed first party and third-party apps. You can sign into Feedback Hub using either your personal Microsoft account or an account provided by your organization (such as your employer or school) that you use to sign into Microsoft products. Signing in with your work or school account allows you to submit feedback to Microsoft in association with your organization.\r\n    Any feedback you provide whether using your work or school account or personal Microsoft account is publicly viewable. Additionally, if feedback is provided using your work or school account, your feedback can be viewed through the Feedback Hub by your organization\u2019s IT administrators.\r\n    When you submit feedback to Microsoft about a problem, or upvote a problem, diagnostic data will be sent to Microsoft to improve Microsoft products and services. Depending on your Diagnostic data settings in Start > Settings > Privacy > Diagnostics & feedback, Feedback Hub will either send diagnostic data automatically or you will have the option to send it to Microsoft at the time you provide feedback. Microsoft may also share your feedback and diagnostic data with Microsoft partners (such as a device manufacturer, or firmware developer) to help them troubleshoot products and services that work with Windows and other Microsoft products and services. Learn more about diagnostic data in Windows 10.Location services, motion sensing, and recordingmainlocationservicesmotionsensingmoduleSummaryWindows location service. Microsoft operates a location service that helps determine the precise geographic location of a specific Windows device. Depending on the capabilities of the device, the device\u2019s location can be determined with varying degrees of accuracy and may in some cases be determined precisely. When you have enabled location on a Windows device, or you have given permission for Microsoft apps to access location information on non-Windows devices, data about cell towers and Wi-Fi access points and their locations is collected by Microsoft and added to the location database after removing any data identifying the person or device from which it was collected. This de-identified copy of location information is used to improve Microsoft's location services and, in some instances, shared with our location service provider partners, currently HERE (see https://www.here.com/), to improve the location services of the provider.\r\n    Windows services and features (such as browsers and Cortana), apps running on Windows, and websites opened in Windows browsers can access the device\u2019s location through Windows if you allow them to do so. Some features and apps request location permission when you first install Windows, some ask the first time you use the app, and others ask every time you access the device\u2019s location. For information about certain Windows apps that use the device\u2019s location, see the Windows apps section of this privacy statement. \r\n    When an app or feature accesses the device\u2019s location and you are signed in with a Microsoft account, your Windows device will also upload its location to the cloud where it is available across your devices to other apps or services that use your Microsoft account and for which you\u2019ve granted permission. We will retain only the last known location (each new location replaces the previous one). Data about a Windows device's recent location history is also stored on the device even if not using a Microsoft account, and certain apps and Windows features can access this location history. You can clear your device's location history at any time in the device's Settings menu.\r\n\r\n    In Settings, you can also view which apps have access to the device\u2019s precise location or your device's location history, turn off or on access to the device\u2019s location for particular apps, or turn off access to the device\u2019s location. You can also set a default location, which will be used when the location service can\u2019t detect a more exact location for your device.\r\n    Even when you\u2019ve turned off access to the device\u2019s location, some third-party desktop apps and services could use other technologies (such as Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, cellular modem, etc.) to determine the device\u2019s precise location. \r\nLearn more about third-party desktop apps and how they may still be able to determine your device\u2019s location when the device\u2019s location setting is off.\r\n    In addition, to facilitate getting help in an emergency, whenever you make an emergency call, Windows will attempt to determine and share your precise location, regardless of your location settings. If your device has a SIM card or is otherwise using cellular service, your mobile operator will have access to your device\u2019s location. \r\nLearn more about location in Windows 10.General Location. If you turn on the General Location feature, apps that cannot use your precise location will have access to your general location, such as your city, postal code, or region.Find My Phone. The Find My Phone feature allows you to find the location of your Windows phone from the Microsoft account website, even if you have turned off all access to the location service on the phone. If you have turned on the \"save my location every few hours\" feature in the Find My Phone settings on your phone, the Find My Phone feature will periodically send and store a single last-known location of your phone, even if you have turned off location services on your phone. Each time a new location is sent, it replaces the previously-stored location.\r\nFind my device. The Find my device feature allows an administrator of a Windows portable device to find the location of that device from account.microsoft.com/devices. To enable Find my device, an administrator needs to be signed in with a Microsoft account and have the location setting enabled. This feature will work even if other users have denied access to location for all their apps. When the administrator attempts to locate the device, users will see a notification in the notification area. \r\nLearn more about Find my device in Windows 10.Windows motion sensing. Windows devices with motion activity detection can collect motion activity. This data can enable features such as a pedometer to count the number of steps you take, so a fitness application can estimate how many calories you burn. This data and history is stored on your device and can be accessed by applications you give permission to access and use that data.\r\nRecording. Some Windows devices have a recording feature that allows you to capture audio and video clips of your activity on the device, including your communications with others. If you choose to record a session, the recording will be saved locally on your device. In some cases, you may have the option to transmit the recording to a Microsoft product or service that broadcasts the recording publicly. Important: You should understand your legal responsibilities before recording and/or transmitting any communication. This includes whether you need to get consent from all parties to the communication in advance. Microsoft is not responsible for how you use recording features or your recordings.Security and safety featuresmainsecurityandsafetyfeaturesmoduleSummaryDevice encryption. Device encryption helps protect the data stored on your device by encrypting it using BitLocker Drive Encryption technology. When device encryption is on, Windows automatically encrypts the drive Windows is installed on and generates a recovery key. The BitLocker recovery key for your personal device is automatically backed up online in your personal Microsoft OneDrive account. Microsoft doesn't use your individual recovery keys for any purpose.\r\nMalicious Software Removal Tool. The Malicious Software Removal Tool (MSRT) runs on your device at least once per month as part of Windows Update. MSRT checks devices for infections by specific, prevalent malicious software (\"malware\") and helps remove any infections found. When the MSRT runs, it will remove the malware listed on the Microsoft Support website if the malware is on your device. During a malware check, a report will be sent to Microsoft with specific data about malware detected, errors, and other data about your device. If you do not want MSRT to send this data to Microsoft, you can disable MSRT's reporting component.\r\nMicrosoft Family. Parents can use Microsoft Family to understand and set boundaries on how their child is using their device. There are many features available to Family members, so please carefully review the information provided when you create or join a Family. When Family activity reporting is turned on for a child, Microsoft will collect details about how the child uses their device and provide parents with reports of that child's activities. Activity reports are routinely deleted from Microsoft servers after a short period of time.\r\nWindows Defender SmartScreen. Windows Defender SmartScreen helps protect you when using our services by checking downloaded files and web content for malicious software, potentially unsafe web content, and other threats to you or your device. When checking a file, data about that file is sent to Microsoft, including the file name, a hash of the file's contents, the download location, and the file's digital certificates. If Windows Defender SmartScreen identifies the file as unknown or potentially unsafe, you will see a warning prior to opening the file. When checking web content, data about the content and your device is sent to Microsoft, including the full web address of the content. If Windows Defender SmartScreen detects that content is potentially unsafe, you will see a warning in place of the content. Windows Defender SmartScreen can be turned on or off in Settings.\r\nWindows Defender Antivirus. Windows Defender Antivirus looks for malware and other unwanted software on your device. Windows Defender Antivirus is automatically turned on to help protect your device if no other antimalware software is actively protecting your device. If Windows Defender Antivirus is turned on, it will monitor the security status of your device. When Windows Defender Antivirus is turned on, or is running because Limited Periodic Scanning is enabled, it will automatically send reports to Microsoft that contain data about suspected malware and other unwanted software, and it may also send files that could contain malware. If a report is likely to contain personal data, the report is not sent automatically, and you'll be prompted before it is sent. You can configure Windows Defender Antivirus not to send reports and suspected malware to Microsoft.\r\nSpeech, Inking, and TypingmainspeechinkingtypingmoduleSummaryOnline Speech Recognition. Windows provides both a device-based speech recognition feature (available through the Windows Speech Recognition app) and an online speech recognition service, in regions where Cortana is available. To learn more about what languages and regions speech currently supports, see Cortana\u2019s regions and languages.\r\n\r\n    Turning on the online speech recognition setting lets you use Windows cloud-based speech recognition in Cortana, the Mixed Reality Portal, dictation in Windows from the software keyboard, supported Microsoft Store apps, and over time other parts of Windows. \r\n    When you use the Windows online speech recognition service, Microsoft collects and uses your voice recordings to create a text transcription of the spoken words in the voice data. The voice data is used in the aggregate to help improve our ability to correctly recognize all users\u2019 speech.\r\n\r\n    You can use device-based speech recognition without sending your voice data to Microsoft. However, the Windows cloud-based speech service provides more powerful recognition than the device-based speech recognition. When the online speech recognition setting is turned off, speech services that don\u2019t rely on the cloud and only use device-based recognition, like the Narrator app or the Windows Speech Recognition app, will still work, and Microsoft won\u2019t collect any voice data.\r\n\r\n    If you\u2019ve given permission in Cortana, we also collect your name and nickname, your recent calendar events, and the names of the people in your appointments, information about your contacts including names and nicknames, names of your favorite places, apps you use, and information about your music preferences. This additional data enables us to better recognize people, events, places, and music when you dictate commands, messages, or documents.\r\n    You can turn off online speech recognition at any time. This will stop the data collection for this feature. To control the voice data Microsoft has associated with your Microsoft account, please visit the Microsoft privacy dashboard. When you turn off the online speech recognition setting, any voice data collected while you were not signed in with a Microsoft account will be disassociated from your device. Learn more about the online speech recognition in Windows 10.\r\nInking & Typing Personalization. Your typed and handwritten words are collected to provide you with: a personal dictionary, better character recognition to help you type and write on your device, and text suggestions that appear as you type or write. If you sync your Windows device settings to other Windows devices, your local user dictionary will be stored in your personal OneDrive for the purpose of enabling sharing of your dictionary with your other Windows devices. Learn more about sync settings.\r\n    You can turn off Inking & typing personalization at any time. This will delete data stored on your device, such as your local user dictionary. Learn more about inking & typing personalization in Windows 10.Sync settingsmainsyncsettingsmoduleSummary\r\n    When you sign in to Windows with a Microsoft account, Windows syncs some of your settings and data with Microsoft servers to make it easier to have personalized experiences across multiple devices. After you've signed in to one or more devices with a Microsoft account, when you sign in to another with the same Microsoft account for the first time, Windows will download and apply the settings and data you choose to sync from your other devices. Settings you choose to sync will automatically update on Microsoft servers and your other devices as you use them.\r\n\r\n    Some of the settings that are synced include:---Apps you've installed from the Microsoft Store ---Language preferences ---Ease of Access preferences ---Personalization settings such as your account picture, background, and mouse settings ---Settings for Microsoft Store apps---Spell-checker dictionaries, input method editor (IME) dictionaries, and personal dictionaries ---Internet Explorer browser history, favorites, and websites you have open---Saved app, website, mobile hotspot, and Wi-Fi network names and passwords \r\n    You can choose whether to sync your settings, and control what is synced, by going to Start > Settings > Accounts > Sync your settings. Some apps have their own, separate sync controls. If you sign in to Windows with a work account and you choose to connect that account to your personal Microsoft account, Windows will ask which settings you want to sync before connecting your Microsoft account.\r\nUpdate ServicesmainupdateservicesmoduleSummary\r\n    Update Services for Windows includes Windows Update and Microsoft Update. Windows Update is a service that provides you with software updates for Windows software and other supporting software, such as drivers and firmware supplied by device manufacturers. Microsoft Update is a service that provides you with software updates for other Microsoft software such as\u00a0Office.\r\n\r\n    Windows Update automatically downloads Windows software updates to your device. You can configure Windows Update to automatically install these updates as they become available (recommended) or have Windows notify you when a restart is required to finish installing updates. Apps available through the Microsoft Store are automatically updated through the Microsoft Store, as described in the\u00a0Microsoft Store section of this privacy statement.\r\nWeb browsers\u2014Microsoft Edge and Internet ExplorermainwebbrowsersmoduleSummary\r\n    Microsoft Edge is the default web browser for Windows. Internet Explorer, the legacy browser from Microsoft, is also available in Windows. Whenever you use a web browser to access the internet, data about your device (\"standard device data\") is sent to the websites you visit and online services you use. Standard device data includes your device's IP address, browser type and language, access times, and referring website addresses. This data might be logged on those websites' web servers. Which data is logged and how that data is used depends on the privacy practices of the websites you visit and web services you use. Additionally, Microsoft Edge sends a unique browser ID to certain websites to enable us to develop aggregate data used to improve browser features and services.\r\n    Additionally, data about how you use your browser, such as your browsing history, web form data, temporary internet files, and cookies, is stored on your device. You can delete this data from your device using Delete Browsing History.\r\n\r\n    Microsoft Edge allows you to capture and save content on your device, such as:---Web note. Allows you to create ink and text annotations on the webpages you visit, and clip, save, or share them.---Active reading. Allows you to create and manage reading lists, including websites or documents.---Hub. Allows you to easily manage your reading lists, favorites, downloads, and history all in one area.---Website Pin to Taskbar. which allows you to pin your favorite websites to the Windows taskbar. Websites will be able to see which of their webpages you have pinned, so they can provide you a notification badge letting you know there is something new for you to check out on their websites.\r\n    Some Microsoft browser information saved on your device will be synced across other devices when you sign in with your Microsoft account. For instance, in Internet Explorer, this information includes your browsing history and favorites; and in Microsoft Edge, it includes your favorites, reading lists, autofill form entries (such as your name, address, and phone number), and may include data for extensions that you have installed. As an example, if you sync your Microsoft Edge reading list across devices, copies of the content you choose to save to your reading list will be sent to each synced device for later viewing. You can disable syncing in Internet Explorer by going to Start > Settings > Accounts > Sync your settings. (For more information, see the Sync settings section of this privacy statement.) You can also disable syncing of Microsoft Edge browser information by turning off the sync option in Microsoft Edge Settings.\r\n\r\n    Microsoft Edge and Internet Explorer use your search queries and browsing history to provide you with faster browsing and more relevant search results. These features include:---Search suggestions in Internet Explorer automatically sends the information you type into the browser address bar to your default search provider (such as Bing) to offer search recommendations as you type each character. ---Search and site suggestions in Microsoft Edge automatically sends the information you type into the browser address bar to Bing (even if you have selected another default search provider) to offer search recommendations as you type each character.\r\n    You can turn off these features at any time. In order to provide search results, Microsoft Edge and Internet Explorer send your search queries, standard device information, and location (if you have location enabled) to your default search provider. If Bing is your default search provider, we use this data as described in the Bing section of this privacy statement.\r\n\r\n    Cortana can assist you with your web browsing in Microsoft Edge with features such as Ask Cortana. You can disable Cortana assistance in Microsoft Edge at any time in Microsoft Edge Settings.

Some of those apps include:\r\nMaps app. The Maps app provides location-based services and uses Bing services to process your searches within the Maps app. When the Maps app has access to your location, and you have enabled location-based services in Windows, when you use the \u201c@\u201d key to initiate a search in supported text boxes in Windows apps, Bing services collects the text you type after the \u201c@\u201d key to provide location-based suggestions. To learn more about these Bing-powered experiences, see the Bing section of this privacy statement. When the Maps app has access to your location, even when the app is not in use, Microsoft may collect de-identified location data from your device to improve Microsoft services. You can disable the Maps app's access to your location by turning off the location service or turning off the Maps app's access to the location service.\r\n\r\n    You can keep track of your favorite places and recent map searches in the Maps app. Your favorite places and search history will be included as search suggestions. If you're signed in with your Microsoft account, your favorite places, search history, and certain app settings will be synced across other devices and services (for example, Cortana). For more information, see the Sync settings section of this privacy statement.\r\nCamera and Photo apps. If you allow the Camera app to use your location, location data is embedded in the photos you take with your device. Other descriptive data, such as camera model and the date that the picture was taken, is also embedded in photos and videos. If you choose to share a photo or video, any embedded data will be accessible to the people and services you share with. You can disable the Camera app's access to your location by turning off all access to the location service in your device's Settings menu or turning off the Camera app's access to the location service.\r\n\r\n    Your photos, videos, and screenshots that are saved in your camera roll automatically upload to OneDrive. You can manage your photos and videos in OneDrive, and you can disable the automatic upload in Settings.\r\n\r\n    When you take photos embedded with your location, the Photos app can group your photos by time and location. To group your photos, the Photos app sends location data in your photos to Microsoft to determine the names of locations, such as \"Seattle, Washington.\" When you are using the Photo app while signed in to your Microsoft account, your photos and videos from OneDrive will be automatically sorted into albums in the Photo app and will also appear on the Photo app's live tile. Your photos and/or videos will only be shared with others if you choose to do so.\r\nPeople app. The People app lets you see and interact with all your contacts in one place. When you add an account to the People app, your contacts from your account will be automatically added to the People app. You can add other accounts to the People app, including your social networks (such as Facebook and Twitter) and email accounts. When you add an account, we tell you what data the People app can import or sync with the particular service and let you choose what you want to add. Other apps you install may also sync data to the People app, including providing additional details to existing contacts. When you view a contact in the People app, information about your recent interactions with the contact (such as emails and calendar events, including from apps that the People app syncs data from) will be retrieved and displayed to you. You can remove an account from the People app at any time.Mail and Calendar app. The Mail and Calendar app allows you to connect all your email, calendars, and files in one place, including those from third-party email and file storage providers. The app provides location-based services, such as weather information in your calendar, but you can disable the app\u2019s use of your location. When you add an account to the Mail and Calendar app, your email, calendar items, files, contacts, and other settings from your account will automatically sync to your device and to Microsoft servers. At any time, you can remove an account or make changes to the data that\u2019s synced from your account. To configure an account, you must provide the app with the account credentials (such as user name and password), which will be sent over the internet to the third-party provider\u2019s server. The app will first attempt to use a secure (SSL) connection to configure your account but will send this information unencrypted if your email provider does not support SSL. If you add an account provided by an organization (such as a company email address), the owner of the organizational domain can implement certain policies and controls (for example, multi-factor authentication or the ability to remotely wipe data from your device) that may affect your use of the app.\r\nMessaging app. When you sign in with a Microsoft account on your device, you can choose to back up your information, which will sync your SMS and MMS messages and store them in your Microsoft account. This allows you to retrieve the messages if you lose or change phones. After your initial device set-up, you can manage your messaging settings at any time. Turning off your SMS/MMS backup will not delete messages that have been previously backed up to your Microsoft account. To delete such messages, you must first delete them from your device prior to turning off backup. If you allow the Messaging app to use your location, you can attach a link to your current location to an outgoing message. Location information will be collected by Microsoft as described in the Windows Location services section of this privacy statement.\r\nWindows Media PlayermainwindowsmediaplayermoduleSummaryWindows Media Player allows you to play CDs, DVDs, and other digital content (such as WMA and MP3 files), rip CDs, and manage your media library. To enrich your experience when you play content in your library, Windows Media player displays related media information, such as album title, song titles, album art, artist, and composer. To augment your media information, Windows Media player will send a request to Microsoft which contains standard computer information, an identifier for the media content, and the media information already contained in your Windows Media Player library (including information you may have edited or entered yourself) so that Microsoft can recognize the track and then return additional information that is available.Windows Media Player also allows you to play back content that is streamed to you over a network. To provide this service, it is necessary for Windows Media Player to communicate with a streaming media server. These servers are typically operated by non-Microsoft content providers.

For example, a photo editing app might access your device's camera to let you take a new photo or access photos or videos stored on your device for editing, and a restaurant guide might use your location to provide nearby recommendations. Information about the features that an app uses is provided on the app's product description page in Microsoft Store. Many of the features that Microsoft Store apps use can be turned on or off through your device\u2019s privacy settings. In Windows, in many cases, you can choose which apps can use a particular feature. Go to Start > Settings > Privacy, select the feature (for example, Calendar), and then select which app permissions are on or off. The lists of apps in Windows privacy settings that can use hardware and software features will not include \"Classic Windows\" applications, and these applications are not affected by these settings.App updates. Unless you have turned off automatic app updates in the relevant Microsoft Store settings, Microsoft Store will automatically check for, download, and install app updates to ensure that you have the latest versions. Updated apps might use different Windows hardware and software features from the previous versions, which could give them access to different data on your device. You will be prompted for consent if an updated app accesses certain features, such as location. You can also review the hardware and software features an app uses by viewing its product description page in Microsoft Store.Each app's use of your data collected through any of these features is subject to the app developer's privacy policies. If an app available through Microsoft Store collects and uses any of your personal data, the app developer is required to provide a privacy policy, and a link to the privacy policy is available on the app's product description page in Microsoft Store.Sideloaded apps and developer mode. Developer features such as the \"developer mode\" setting are intended for development use only. If you enable developer features, your device may become unreliable or unusable, and expose you to security risks. Downloading or otherwise acquiring apps from sources other than Microsoft Store, also known as \"sideloading\" apps, may make your device and personal data more vulnerable to attack or unexpected use by apps. Windows policies, notifications, permissions, and other features intended to help protect your privacy when apps access your data may not function as described in this statement for sideloaded apps or when developer features are enabled.MSNmainmainmoduleSummaryMSN services include websites and a suite of apps, including MSN News, Weather, Sports, and Money, and previous versions of the apps branded as Bing (together, \"MSN Apps\"). The MSN Apps are available on various platforms, including Windows, iOS, and Android. MSN services are also included within other Microsoft services, including the Microsoft Edge browser.When you install MSN Apps, we collect data that tells us if the app was installed properly, the installation date, the app version, and other data about your device such as the operating system and browser. This data is collected on a regular basis to help us determine the number of MSN App users and identify performance issues associated with different app versions, operating systems, and browsers.We also collect data about how you interact with MSN services, such as usage frequency and articles viewed, to provide you with relevant content.

When you choose to use third-party apps or experiences: (i) your data is subject to that third party\u2019s privacy policy; and (ii) with your consent, the third party developer will have access to information about you that is not part of your public profile, such as your settings, email address and age range.\r\nGroove Music and Movies & TVmaingroovemusicmoviestvmoduleSummaryGroove Music lets you easily play your music collection and make playlists. Microsoft Movies & TV allows you to play your video collection and rent or buy movies and TV episodes. These services were formerly offered as Xbox Music and Video.To help you discover content that may interest you, Microsoft will collect data about what content you play, the length of play, and the rating you give it. If you sign in to Cortana on your device, Microsoft will collect and use data related to the music you play via Groove Music to provide personalized experiences and relevant suggestions.To enrich your experience when playing content, Groove Music and Movies & TV will display related information about the content you play and the content in your music and video libraries, such as the album title, cover art, song or video title, and other information, where available. To provide this information, Groove Music and Movies & TV send an information request to Microsoft containing standard device data, such as your device IP address, device software version, your regional and language settings, and an identifier for the content.If you use Movies & TV to access content that has been protected with Microsoft Digital Rights Management (DRM), it may automatically request media usage rights from an online rights server and download and install DRM updates in order to let you play the content. See the DRM information in the Silverlight section of this privacy statement for more information.SilverlightmainsilverlightmoduleSummaryMicrosoft Silverlight helps you to access and enjoy rich content on the Web. Silverlight enables websites and services to store data on your device. Other Silverlight features involve connecting to Microsoft to obtain updates, or to Microsoft or third-party servers to play protected digital content.Silverlight Configuration tool. You can make choices about these features in the Silverlight Configuration tool. To access the Silverlight Configuration tool, right click on content that is currently being displayed by Silverlight and select Silverlight. You can also run the Silverlight Configuration tool directly. In Windows, for example, you can access the tool by searching for \"Microsoft Silverlight.\"Silverlight application storage. Silverlight-based applications can store data files locally on your computer for a variety of purposes, including saving your custom settings, storing large files for graphically intensive features (such as games, maps, and images), and storing content that you create within certain applications. You can turn off or configure application storage in the Silverlight Configuration tool.Silverlight updates. Silverlight will periodically check a Microsoft server for updates to provide you with the latest features and improvements. A small file containing information about the latest Silverlight version will be downloaded to your computer and compared to your currently installed version. If a newer version is available, it will be downloaded and installed on your computer. You can turn off or configure updates in the Silverlight Configuration tool.Digital Rights Management. Silverlight uses Microsoft Digital Rights Management (DRM) technology to help protect the rights of content owners. If you access DRM-protected content (such as music or video) with Silverlight, it will request media usage rights from a rights server on the Internet. In order to provide a seamless playback experience, you will not be prompted before Silverlight sends the request to the rights server. When requesting media usage rights, Silverlight will provide the rights server with an ID for the DRM-protected content file and basic data about your device, including data about the DRM components on your device such as their revision and security levels, and a unique identifier for your device.DRM updates. In some cases, accessing DRM-protected content will require an update to Silverlight or to the DRM components on your device. When you attempt to play content that requires a DRM update, Silverlight will send a request to a Microsoft server containing basic data about your device, including information about the DRM components on your computer such as their revision and security levels, troubleshooting data, and a unique identifier for your device. The Microsoft server uses this identifier to return a unique DRM update for your device, which will then be installed by Silverlight. You can turn off or configure DRM component updates on the Playback tab in the Silverlight Configuration tool.Microsoft Health servicesmainmicrosofthealthservicesmoduleSummary\r\n    Microsoft Health services can help you understand and manage your health data. They include HealthVault, HealthVault Insights, Microsoft Band devices, other Microsoft Health applications and related products. The Band helps you keep track of data like heart rate and steps taken. The Band can also use Cortana to take notes and receive notifications from your phone. The Microsoft Health applications send data to Microsoft servers and allow you to view, manage and control the data. The applications may enable notifications to the Band and other devices. HealthVault services let you gather, edit, add to, and store health data online, and share your health data with family, caregivers, and health care professionals.\r\n\r\n    Microsoft Health services collect and use your data to provide the services, which includes improving and personalizing your experiences. Health data you provide to Microsoft through Microsoft Health services is not combined with data from other Microsoft services, or used for other purposes without your explicit consent. For example, Microsoft does not use your health record data to market or advertise to you without your opt-in consent.\r\nHealth servicesmainmicrosoftservicelongmoduleSummary\r\n    Microsoft Health services can help you understand and manage your health data. The data collected depends on the services and features you use, and includes the following:\r\n---Profile data. When you create a profile, you provide data, such as height, weight, and age that is used to calculate your activity results. Other profile data comes from your personal Microsoft account.\r\n    ---Activity and fitness data. Microsoft Health services help you keep track of your activity and fitness by collecting data like your heart rate, steps, calories burned, and sleep. Examples of types of activities you can choose to track are runs, workouts, and sleep.\r\n    ---Usage data. To provide you with the best service, we collect and automatically upload statistics about the performance and your use of the Microsoft Health services.\r\n    ---Location. Microsoft Band has built-in Global Positioning System (GPS) capabilities, which let you map your activities like running or biking, without having to carry your phone with you. If you enable GPS for an activity, you can view the activity map in the Microsoft Health applications. Some modes on the Band, such as Golf and Explorer, automatically turn on GPS, and turn it off when you end the mode.\u00a0\r\n    To learn more about the Band's sensors and the data they collect, see the Microsoft Band page on the Microsoft Support website.Access and control. You can view and manage your data in Microsoft Health services. For example, you can view and update your profile data, manage connected applications, and view past activities. You can delete specific activity details in the Microsoft Health services. When you delete a specific activity, the event is deleted from the Microsoft Health services; however, other data and the basic sensor data captured by the devices remain in the Microsoft Health services. You can cancel your Microsoft Health services account at any time by contacting Customer Support from the Microsoft Band website.\r\nCortana. The Microsoft Health services allow you to use Cortana. When you use Cortana, data you process in the Microsoft Health services, including health-related data and data processed from third-party services, is shared with Cortana. Cortana\u2019s capabilities allow you to perform queries and set reminders with your voice, if Cortana is enabled on your device. To learn more about how Cortana manages your data, see the Cortana section of this privacy statement.\r\nHealthVaultmainhealthvaultmoduleSummary\r\n    HealthVault is a personal health platform that lets you gather, edit, store, and share health data online. With HealthVault, you can control your own health records. You can also choose to share your health data with family, caregivers, health care professionals, mobile applications, health-related devices, and online tools. For more information about HealthVault, visit the HealthVault Help page.\r\nSigning in to HealthVault. To sign in to HealthVault, you can use Microsoft account or third-party authentication services. If you close your Microsoft account or lose your account credentials, you may not be able to access your data. You can use more than one credential with HealthVault to help ensure continued access. Before using a third-party authentication service with HealthVault, we recommend you review the security and privacy commitments offered by the issuer.\r\nHealthVault account and Health records. To create a new HealthVault account, you must provide personal data such as name, date of birth, e-mail address, postal code, and country/region. Depending on which features you use, you may be asked for additional information. A HealthVault account allows you to manage one or more health records, such as the ones you create for yourself and your family members. You can add or remove data to a health record you manage at any time.\r\n\r\n    In the U.S., HealthVault assigns each health record a unique HealthVault email address. When a message is received at that email address, the message and attachments are automatically added to the HealthVault record, and a notification email is sent to the custodians of that record. The email service in HealthVault uses \"Direct,\" a protocol designed specifically to communicate with health care providers. For that reason, HealthVault email can only be sent and received with providers that use a system that uses the Direct protocol. Custodians can add or disable record email addresses.\r\nSharing health data. A key value of HealthVault is the ability you have to share your health data with people and services that can help you meet your health-related goals. By default, you are the custodian of any records you create. Custodians have the highest level of access to a health record. As a custodian, you can share data in a health record with another person by sending an e-mail invitation through HealthVault. You can specify what type of access they have (including custodian access), how long they have access, and whether they can modify the data in the record. When you grant someone access, that person can grant the same level of access to someone else (for example, someone with view-only access can grant another user view-only access). Because inappropriate granting of access could allow someone to violate your privacy or even revoke your access to your own records, you should be cautious about granting access to your records.\r\n    You can choose to share specific data (or all of the data) in a health record with other services, including participating third-party services you authorize. No service has access to your data through HealthVault unless an authorized user grants it access through HealthVault. HealthVault allows you to control access by accepting or denying requests. For each service granted access, you choose what health information in a specific health record to share and what actions each service may perform on the health information.\r\n\r\n    A service you authorize for a record will get the full name associated with your HealthVault account, the nickname of the authorized record(s), and your relationship to that record. The service will continue to have access through HealthVault until you revoke the permission. Microsoft can revoke a service's access to HealthVault if it does not meet its privacy commitments to Microsoft. However, except for applying the access permissions you have granted to third-party services, we do not control or monitor third-party services, and their privacy practices will vary.\r\nReports to U.S. health care providers. In the United States, we enable participating health care providers to obtain reports about whether the information they send to a record in Microsoft Health services is used. This feature supports the \"meaningful use\" objective of the HITECH Act, which provides incentives for health care providers to send their patients copies of their medical information electronically. Providers that participate can get reports that include a number the provider uses to identify the patient within its system, and whether the user took one of the \"qualifying actions\" in HealthVault (but no information about which action). \"Qualifying action\" currently includes activities such as viewing, downloading, or transmitting health information via email. You can turn off reporting for your records.\r\nAccess and controls. You can review, edit, or delete your HealthVault account data, or close your HealthVault account at any time. Only custodians can permanently delete an item. When you delete a heath record, it is deleted from all users who had access to it.\r\n\r\n    When you close your HealthVault account, we delete all records for which you are the sole custodian. If you share custodian access for a record, you can decide whether to delete the record. Microsoft will wait a limited amount of time before permanently deleting your data in order to help avoid accidental or malicious removal of your health data.\r\n\r\n    HealthVault maintains a full history of each access, change or deletion by users and services, which includes the date, action, and name of the person or service. Custodians of records can examine the history of those records.\r\nEmail communications. We will use the email address you provide when you create your HealthVault account to send you an email requesting that you validate your email address, to include in sharing invitations you send through HealthVault, and to send you service notifications, such as email notifications that information is available to add to your HealthVault records.\r\n\r\n    HealthVault periodically sends newsletters to help keep you informed of the latest improvements. HealthVault will also periodically send you an email summarizing recent account activity. Subject to your contact preferences, we also use your email addresses to send you promotional email. You can unsubscribe from these emails at any time.\r\n\r\n                                maineuropeanprivacymodule,mainsecurityofpersonaldatamodule,mainwherewestoreandprocessdatamodule,mainourretentionofpersonaldatamodule,mainadvertisingmodule,maincollectionofdatafromchildrenmodule,mainpreviewreleasesmodule,mainchangestothisprivacystatementmodule,mainhowtocontactusmodule\r\n                            \r\n                                mainenterpriseservicesmodule,mainenterprisedevsoftwareappsmodule\r\n                            \r\n                                mainofficeservicesmodule,mainonedrivemodule,mainoutlookmodule,mainskypemodule,mainlinkedinmodule\r\n                            \r\n                                mainbingmodule,maincortanamodule,mainMicrosoftTranslatormodule,mainswiftkeymodule\r\n                            \r\n                                mainactivationmodule,mainactivityhistorymodule,mainadvertisingidmodule,maindiagnosticsmodule,mainfeedbackhubmodule,mainlocationservicesmotionsensingmodule,mainsecurityandsafetyfeaturesmodule, mainspeechinkingtypingmodule, mainsyncsettingsmodule,mainupdateservicesmodule,mainwebbrowsersmodule,mainwi-fisensemodule,mainwindowsappsmodule,mainwindowsmediaplayermodule,mainwindowshellomodule,mainwindowssearchmodule\r\n                            \r\n                                mainxboxmodule,mainwindowsstoremodule,mainmainmodule,mainmixermodule,maingroovemusicmoviestvmodule,mainsilverlightmodule\r\n                            \r\n                                mainmicrosoftservicelongmodule,mainhealthvaultmodule\r\n                            mainenterprisedeveloperproductsmoduleCookies\r\n    Most Microsoft sites use cookies, small text files placed on your device which web servers in the domain that placed the cookie can retrieve later.

For example, you can turn your Android device\u2019s location on or off using the device\u2019s settings app. You can also turn on Location History if you want to create a private map of where you go with your signed-in devices.In some circumstances, Google also collects information about you from publicly accessible sources. For example, if your name appears in your local newspaper, Google\u2019s Search engine may index that article and display it to other people if they search for your name. We may also collect information about you from trusted partners, including marketing partners who provide us with information about potential customers of our business services, and security partners who provide us with information to protect against abuse. We also receive information from advertisers to provide advertising and research services on their behalf.We use various technologies to collect and store information, including cookies, pixel tags, local storage, such as browser web storage or application data caches, databases, and server logs.We use data to build better servicesWe use the information we collect from all our services for the following purposes:We use your information to deliver our services, like processing the terms you search for in order to return results or helping you share content by suggesting recipients from your contacts.We also use your information to ensure our services are working as intended, such as tracking outages or troubleshooting issues that you report to us. And we use your information to make improvements to our services \u2014 for example, understanding which search terms are most frequently misspelled helps us improve spell-check features used across our services.We use the information we collect in existing services to help us develop new ones. For example, understanding how people organized their photos in Picasa, Google\u2019s first photos app, helped us design and launch Google Photos.We use the information we collect to customize our services for you, including providing recommendations, personalized content, and customized search results.

And Google Play uses information like apps you\u2019ve already installed and videos you\u2019ve watched on YouTube to suggest new apps you might like.Depending on your settings, we may also show you personalized ads based on your interests.

For example, Google Translate helps people communicate across languages by detecting common language patterns in phrases you ask it to translate.We may combine the information we collect among our services and across your devices for the purposes described above. For example, if you watch videos of guitar players on YouTube, you might see an ad for guitar lessons on a site that uses our ad products. Depending on your account settings, your activity on other sites and apps may be associated with your personal information in order to improve Google\u2019s services and the ads delivered by Google.If other users already have your email address or other information that identifies you, we may show them your publicly visible Google Account information, such as your name and photo. This helps people identify an email coming from you, for example.We\u2019ll ask for your consent before using your information for a purpose that isn\u2019t covered in this Privacy Policy.You have choices regarding the information we collect and how it's usedThis section describes key controls for managing your privacy across our services.

We also may use your IP address to determine your approximate location, so that we can serve you ads for a nearby pizza delivery service if you search for \u201cpizza.\u201d Learn more about Google ads and why you may see particular ads.For example, when you type an address in the To, Cc, or Bcc field of an email you're composing, Gmail will suggest addresses based on the people you contact most frequently.If you add your phone number to your account, it can be used for different purposes across Google services, depending on your settings. For example, your phone number can be used to help you access your account if you forget your password, help people find and connect with you, and make the ads you see more relevant to you. Learn moreFor example, if you add a credit card or other payment method to your Google Account, you can use it to buy things across our services, like apps in the Play Store. We may also ask for other information, like a business tax ID, to help process your payment. In some cases, we may also need to verify your identity and may ask you for information to do this.We may also use payment information to verify that you meet age requirements, if, for example, you enter an incorrect birthday indicating you\u2019re not old enough to have a Google Account. Learn moreFor example, we can use information from your devices to help you decide which device you\u2019d like to use to install an app or view a movie you buy from Google Play. We also use this information to help protect your account.Android devices with Google apps include devices sold by Google or one of our partners and include phones, cameras, vehicles, wearables, and televisions. These devices use Google Play Services and other pre-installed apps that include services like Gmail, Maps, your phone\u2019s camera and phone dialer, text-to-speech conversion, keyboard input, and security features.For example, we collect information about views and interactions with ads so we can provide aggregated reports to advertisers, like telling them whether we served their ad on a page and whether the ad was likely seen by a viewer. We may also measure other interactions, such as how you move your mouse over an ad or if you interact with the page on which the ad appears.Your Chrome browsing history is only saved to your account if you\u2019ve enabled Chrome synchronization with your Google Account. Learn moreExamples of these services include:---Google Hangouts, for making domestic and international calls---Google Voice, for making calls, sending text messages, and managing voicemail---Google Fi, for a phone planYour device may have sensors that can be used to better understand your location and movement. For example, an accelerometer can be used to determine your speed and a gyroscope to figure out your direction of travel.If you use Google\u2019s Location services on Android, we can improve the performance of apps that rely on your location, like Google Maps. If you use Google\u2019s Location services, your device sends information to Google about its location, sensors (like accelerometer), and nearby cell towers and Wi-Fi access points (like MAC address and signal strength). All these things help to determine your location. You can use your device settings to enable Google Location services. Learn moreFor example, we may collect information that\u2019s publicly available online or from other public sources to help train Google\u2019s language models and build features like Google Translate.For example, information about security threats can help us notify you if we think your account has been compromised (at which point we can help you take steps to protect your account).For example, advertisers may upload data from their loyalty-card programs so that they can better understand the performance of their ad campaigns. We only provide aggregated reports to advertisers that don\u2019t reveal information about individual people.Examples of how we use your information to deliver our services include:---We use the IP address assigned to your device to send you the data you requested, such as loading a YouTube video---We use unique identifiers stored in cookies on your device to help us authenticate you as the person who should have access to your Google Account---Photos and videos you upload to Google Photos are used to help you create albums, animations, and other creations that you can share. Learn more---A flight confirmation email you receive may be used to create a \u201ccheck-in\u201d button that appears in your Gmail---When you purchase services or physical goods from us, you may provide us information like your shipping address or delivery instructions. We use this information for things like processing, fulfilling, and delivering your order, and to provide support in connection with the product or service you purchase.For example, we continuously monitor our systems to look for problems. And if we find something wrong with a specific feature, reviewing activity information collected before the problem started allows us to fix things more quickly.For example, we use cookies to analyze how people interact with our services. And that analysis can help us build better products. For example, it may help us discover that it\u2019s taking people too long to complete a certain task or that they have trouble finishing steps at all. We can then redesign that feature and improve the product for everyone.For example, when you\u2019re signed in to your Google Account and have the Web & App Activity control enabled, you can get more relevant search results that are based on your previous searches and activity from other Google services. You can learn more here. You may also get customized search results even when you\u2019re signed out. If you don\u2019t want this level of search customization, you can search and browse privately or turn off signed-out search personalization.You may also see personalized ads based on information from the advertiser. If you shopped on an advertiser's website, for example, they can use that visit information to show you ads. Learn moreWhen showing you personalized ads, we use topics that we think might be of interest to you based on your activity. For example, you may see ads for things like \"Cooking and Recipes\" or \"Air Travel.\u201d We don\u2019t use topics or show personalized ads based on sensitive categories like race, religion, sexual orientation, or health. And we require the same from advertisers that use our services.Google Analytics relies on first-party cookies, which means the cookies are set by the Google Analytics customer. Using our systems, data generated through Google Analytics can be linked by the Google Analytics customer and by Google to third-party cookies that are related to visits to other websites. For example, an advertiser may want to use its Google Analytics data to create more relevant ads, or to further analyze its traffic. Learn moreSome examples of how we use your information to help keep our services safe and reliable include:---Collecting and analyzing IP addresses and cookie data to protect against automated abuse. This abuse takes many forms, such as sending spam to Gmail users, stealing money from advertisers by fraudulently clicking on ads, or censoring content by launching a Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack.---The \u201clast account activity\u201d feature in Gmail can help you find out if and when someone accessed your email without your knowledge. This feature shows you information about recent activity in Gmail, such as the IP addresses that accessed your mail, the associated location, and the date and time of access. Learn moreWhen we detect spam, malware, illegal content, and other forms of abuse on our systems in violation of our policies, we may disable your account or take other appropriate action.

When selecting our suppliers and partners, we take into account their data handling processes.\nIf IBM decides to sell, buy, merge or otherwise reorganize businesses in some countries, such a transaction may involve the disclosure of personal information to prospective or actual purchasers, or the receipt of such information from sellers. It is IBM's practice to require appropriate protection for personal information in these types of transactions.\nPlease be aware that in certain circumstances, personal information may be subject to disclosure to government agencies pursuant to judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process. We may also share your personal information to protect the rights or property of IBM, our business partners, suppliers or clients, and others when we have reasonable grounds to believe that such rights or property have been or could be affected.\nThe international footprint of IBM involves a large number of transfers of personal information between different subsidiaries, as well as to third parties located in the countries where we do business. Some countries have implemented transfer restrictions for personal information, in connection with which IBM takes various measures, including:\n---Where required, IBM implements Standard Contractual Clauses approved by the EU Commission, or similar contractual clauses in other jurisdictions. This includes transfers to suppliers or other third parties. You can request a copy of the EU Standard Contractual Clauses here.\n---IBM certified to the APEC Cross Border Privacy Rules.\n---IBM certified to the EU-U.S. and Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield Frameworks. More information can be found here.\nBack to top\nWe intend to protect your personal information and to maintain its accuracy. IBM implements reasonable physical, administrative and technical safeguards to help us protect your personal information from unauthorized access, use and disclosure. For example, we encrypt certain sensitive personal information such as credit card information when we transmit such information over the Internet. We also require that our suppliers protect such information from unauthorized access, use and disclosure.\nWe will not retain personal information longer than necessary to fulfill the purposes for which it is processed, including the security of our processing complying with legal and regulatory obligations (e.g. audit, accounting and statutory retention terms), handling disputes, and for the establishment, exercise or defense of legal claims in the countries where we do business.\nBecause the circumstances may vary depending on the context and the services, the information provided in Online Privacy Statement or provided in a specific notice may provide more detailed information on applicable retention terms.\nIf you have a question related to this Privacy Statement, please contact us by using this form. Your message will be forwarded to the appropriate member of IBM's Data Privacy Team, such as Data Protection Officers or members of their teams.\nFor the purposes of the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), the controller of your personal information is International Business Machines Corporation (IBM Corp.), 1 New Orchard Road, Armonk, New York, United States, unless indicated otherwise. Where IBM Corp. or a subsidiary it controls (not established in the European Economic Area (EEA)) is required to appoint a legal representative in the EEA, the representative for all such cases is IBM United Kingdom Limited, PO Box 41, North Harbour, Portsmouth, Hampshire, United Kingdom PO6 3AU.\nIBM Corp. is not the controller in situations such as:\n---Personal information processed in connection with a contractual relationship, or with entering into a contractual relationship with a specific IBM subsidiary. In this case the controller of personal information is the IBM contracting company, which is the legal entity with which you or your employer have, or will have, the contract.\n---Personal information collected on the physical site or location of an IBM subsidiary. In this case that subsidiary is the controller of the personal information.\nYou can request to access, update or correct your personal information. You also have the right to object to direct marketing. You can access the request process here.\nYou may have additional rights pursuant to your local law applicable to the processing. For example, if the processing of your personal information is subject to the EU General Data Protection Regulation (\"GDPR\"), and your personal information is processed based on legitimate interests, you have the right to object to the processing on grounds relating to your specific situation. Under GDPR you may also have the right to request to have your personal information deleted or restricted and ask for portability of your personal information.\nIn the event you consider our processing of your personal information not to be compliant with the applicable data protection laws, you can lodge a complaint:\n---Directly with IBM by using this form.\n---With the competent data protection authority. The name and contact details of the Data Protection Authorities in the European Union can be found here.\nFrom time to time we may update this Privacy Statement, as well as any other specific privacy statement.

By virtue of these relationships, the third parties may obtain information from their visitors. We have no control over these third parties' use of this information, which is subject to their own privacy policies.  IV. Cookies and Other User and Ad-Targeting Technologies. We use cookies and other technologies both to provide our Services to you and to advertise to you.  We also may work with Partners to help them advertise to you when you visit other websites or mobile applications, and to help them perform user analytics.  These technologies may also be used to analyze how our Users interact with advertising on our Services and elsewhere, and more generally, to learn more about our Users and what services or offers you might prefer to receive.  We describe some of these technologies below. 1. Cookies.  To enhance your online experience, we and our Partners use \"cookies\", \"web beacons\" or other tracking technologies. Cookies are text files placed in your computer's browser to store your preferences. We use cookies or other tracking technologies to understand Service and Internet usage and to improve or customize the products, content, offerings, services or advertisements on our Services. For example, we may use cookies to personalize your experience at our Services (e.g., to recognize you by name when you return to a Service), save your password in password-protected areas, and enable you to use shopping carts on our Services. We also may use cookies or other tracking technologies to help us offer you products, content, offerings or services that may be of interest to you and to deliver relevant advertising when you visit this Service, a Turner Affiliate's Service, or when you visit other websites or applications.  We or a third party platform with whom we work may place or recognize a unique cookie on your browser to enable you to receive customized content, offers, services or advertisements on our Services or other sites.  These cookies contain no information intended to identify you personally. The cookies may be associated with de-identified demographic or other data linked to or derived from data you voluntarily have submitted to us (e.g., your email address) that we may share with a service provider solely in hashed, non-human readable form.We, our third party service providers, advertisers, advertising networks and platforms, agencies, or our Partners also may use cookies or other tracking technologies to manage and measure the performance of advertisements displayed on or delivered by or through the Turner Network and/or other networks or Services. This also helps us, our service providers and Partners provide more relevant advertising. 2. Syncing Cookies and Identifiers.  We may work with our Partners (for instance, third party ad platforms) to synchronize unique, anonymous identifiers (such as those associated with cookies) in order to match our Partners' uniquely coded user identifiers to our own.  We may do this, for instance, to enhance data points about a particular unique browser or device, and thus enable us or others to send ads that are more relevant, match Users to their likely product interests, or better synchronize, cap, or optimize advertising.  3. Locally Stored Objects. Services on the Turner Network may employ locally stored objects (\"LSOs\") and other client side storage tracking technologies in certain situations where they help to provide a better user experience, such as to remember settings, preferences and usage similar to browser cookies, or in order to target or help our Partners target ads, analyze ad performance, or perform user, website or market analytics.  For LSOs utilized by Adobe Flash you can access Flash management tools from Adobe's website.  In addition, some, but not all browsers, provide the ability to remove LSOs, sometimes within cookie and privacy settings.  4. Disabling CookiesMost web browsers are set up to accept cookies. You may be able to set your browser to warn you before accepting certain cookies or to refuse certain cookies. However, if you disable the use of cookies in your web browser, some features of the Services may be difficult to use or inoperable. We may work with certain third-party companies that use techniques other than HTTP cookies to recognize your computer or device and/or to collect and record information about your web surfing activity, including those integrated with our Services.  Please keep in mind that your web browser may not permit you to block the use of these techniques, and those browser settings that block conventional cookies may have no effect on such techniques.  To learn more about Interest-Based Advertising or to opt-out of this type of advertising by those third parties that are members of DAA's opt-out program, please go to http://www.aboutads.info.   5. Web Beacons.   We and our Partners may also use \"web beacons\" or clear GIFs, or similar technologies, which are small pieces of code placed on a Service or in an email, to monitor the behavior and collect data about the visitors viewing a Service or email. For example, web beacons may be used to count the users who visit a web page or to deliver a cookie to the browser of a visitor viewing that Service.  Web beacons may also be used to provide information on the effectiveness of our email campaigns (e.g., open rates, clicks, forwards, etc.). 6. Mobile Device Identifiers and SDKs.  We also sometimes use, or partner with publishers, publisher-facing, or app developer platforms that use mobile Software Development Kits (\"SDKs\"), or use an SDK with a mobile app that we offer, to collect Information, such as mobile identifiers (e.g., IDFAs and Android Advertising IDs), and Information connected to how mobile devices interact with our Services and those using our Services.  A mobile SDK is the mobile app version of a web beacon (see \"Web Beacons\" above).  The SDK is a bit of computer code that app developers can include in their apps to enable ads to be shown, data to be collected, and related services or analytics to be performed.  We may use this technology to deliver or help our Partners deliver certain advertising through mobile applications and browsers based on information associated with your mobile device. If you'd like to opt-out from having ads tailored to you in this way on your mobile device, please follow the instructions in the \"Your Ad Choices\" section below.  By visiting the Service, whether as a registered user or otherwise, you acknowledge, and agree that you are giving us your consent to track your activities and your use of the Service through the technologies described above, as well as similar technologies developed in the future, and that we may use such tracking technologies in the emails we send to you.Our unaffiliated Partners and third parties may themselves set and access their own tracking technologies when you visit our Services and they may have access to information about you and your online activities over time and across different websites or applications when you use the Service. Their use of such tracking technologies is not in our control and is subject to their own privacy policies.   V. Your Ad ChoicesAdvertising enables us to provide the rich content for which Services on the Turner Network are known, and to provide much of this content free of cost to our Users.  Thus, we strive to provide you with ads that are relevant to you and for products you may want.  However, we also offer you choices with regard to interest-based ads.To learn more about interest-based ads and the choices available to you, please visit our Ad Choices page, which has general information about certain companies that place these ads.You may also find more information about entities involved in online advertising and additional choices you may make through the Network Advertising Initiative (\"NAI\") at the NAI Service, and the Digital Advertising Alliance (the \"DAA\") at the DAA consumer choice Service.  Turner is a participant in the online industry's self-regulatory program administered by the DAA and has agreed to adhere to the DAA's principles applicable to interest-based ads.  The tools provided on the Ad Choices page, as well as the DAA opt-out page and the NAI opt-out page are provided by third parties, not Turner. Turner does not control or operate these tools or the choices that advertisers and others provide through these tools.  When using a mobile application you may receive tailored in-application advertisements. Depending on your device, you may be able to reset your mobile device's advertising identifier at any time by accessing the privacy settings on your mobile device. In addition, each operating system, iOS for Apple phones, Android for Android devices and Windows for Microsoft devices, provides its own instructions on how to prevent the delivery of tailored in-application advertisements. You may review the support materials and/or the privacy settings for the respective operating systems in order to opt-out of tailored in-application advertisements. For any other devices and/or operating systems, please visit the privacy settings for the applicable device or contact (or review the applicable privacy web page of) the applicable platform operator.

How We Respond to Do Not Track SignalsAt this time Services on the Turner Network do not recognize automated browser signals regarding tracking mechanisms, which may include \"do not track\" instructions. 2. Linked ServicesSome of the Services contain links to or integrations with other services such as Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, and other media services and platforms whose information practices may be different than ours.

International TransferThis Service is governed by and operated in accordance with US law. If you are located outside of the US, you use this Service at your own risk.

In particular, your Information will be transferred to and processed in the United States where many of our central databases operate.

Data SecurityWe have put in place physical, electronic, and managerial procedures designed to help prevent unauthorized access, to maintain data security, and to use correctly the Information we collect online. These safeguards vary based on the sensitivity of the Information that we collect and store. Although we take appropriate measures to safeguard against unauthorized disclosures of Information, we cannot assure you that Information will never be disclosed, altered or destroyed in a manner that is inconsistent with this Privacy Policy.5.

By virtue of these relationships, the third parties may obtain information from their visitors. We have no control over these third parties' use of this information, which is subject to their own privacy policies.  IV. Cookies and Other User and Ad-Targeting Technologies. We use cookies and other technologies both to provide our Services to you and to advertise to you.  We also may work with Partners to help them advertise to you when you visit other websites or mobile applications, and to help them perform user analytics.  These technologies may also be used to analyze how our Users interact with advertising on our Services and elsewhere, and more generally, to learn more about our Users and what services or offers you might prefer to receive.  We describe some of these technologies below. 1. Cookies.  To enhance your online experience, we and our Partners use \"cookies\", \"web beacons\" or other tracking technologies. Cookies are text files placed in your computer's browser to store your preferences. We use cookies or other tracking technologies to understand Service and Internet usage and to improve or customize the products, content, offerings, services or advertisements on our Services. For example, we may use cookies to personalize your experience at our Services (e.g., to recognize you by name when you return to a Service), save your password in password-protected areas, and enable you to use shopping carts on our Services. We also may use cookies or other tracking technologies to help us offer you products, content, offerings or services that may be of interest to you and to deliver relevant advertising when you visit this Service, a Turner Affiliate's Service, or when you visit other websites or applications.  We or a third party platform with whom we work may place or recognize a unique cookie on your browser to enable you to receive customized content, offers, services or advertisements on our Services or other sites.  These cookies contain no information intended to identify you personally. The cookies may be associated with de-identified demographic or other data linked to or derived from data you voluntarily have submitted to us (e.g., your email address) that we may share with a service provider solely in hashed, non-human readable form.We, our third party service providers, advertisers, advertising networks and platforms, agencies, or our Partners also may use cookies or other tracking technologies to manage and measure the performance of advertisements displayed on or delivered by or through the Turner Network and/or other networks or Services. This also helps us, our service providers and Partners provide more relevant advertising. 2. Syncing Cookies and Identifiers.  We may work with our Partners (for instance, third party ad platforms) to synchronize unique, anonymous identifiers (such as those associated with cookies) in order to match our Partners' uniquely coded user identifiers to our own.  We may do this, for instance, to enhance data points about a particular unique browser or device, and thus enable us or others to send ads that are more relevant, match Users to their likely product interests, or better synchronize, cap, or optimize advertising.  3. Locally Stored Objects. Services on the Turner Network may employ locally stored objects (\"LSOs\") and other client side storage tracking technologies in certain situations where they help to provide a better user experience, such as to remember settings, preferences and usage similar to browser cookies, or in order to target or help our Partners target ads, analyze ad performance, or perform user, website or market analytics.  For LSOs utilized by Adobe Flash you can access Flash management tools from Adobe's website.  In addition, some, but not all browsers, provide the ability to remove LSOs, sometimes within cookie and privacy settings.  4. Disabling CookiesMost web browsers are set up to accept cookies. You may be able to set your browser to warn you before accepting certain cookies or to refuse certain cookies. However, if you disable the use of cookies in your web browser, some features of the Services may be difficult to use or inoperable. We may work with certain third-party companies that use techniques other than HTTP cookies to recognize your computer or device and/or to collect and record information about your web surfing activity, including those integrated with our Services.  Please keep in mind that your web browser may not permit you to block the use of these techniques, and those browser settings that block conventional cookies may have no effect on such techniques.  To learn more about Interest-Based Advertising or to opt-out of this type of advertising by those third parties that are members of DAA's opt-out program, please go to http://www.aboutads.info.   5. Web Beacons.   We and our Partners may also use \"web beacons\" or clear GIFs, or similar technologies, which are small pieces of code placed on a Service or in an email, to monitor the behavior and collect data about the visitors viewing a Service or email. For example, web beacons may be used to count the users who visit a web page or to deliver a cookie to the browser of a visitor viewing that Service.  Web beacons may also be used to provide information on the effectiveness of our email campaigns (e.g., open rates, clicks, forwards, etc.). 6. Mobile Device Identifiers and SDKs.  We also sometimes use, or partner with publishers, publisher-facing, or app developer platforms that use mobile Software Development Kits (\"SDKs\"), or use an SDK with a mobile app that we offer, to collect Information, such as mobile identifiers (e.g., IDFAs and Android Advertising IDs), and Information connected to how mobile devices interact with our Services and those using our Services.  A mobile SDK is the mobile app version of a web beacon (see \"Web Beacons\" above).  The SDK is a bit of computer code that app developers can include in their apps to enable ads to be shown, data to be collected, and related services or analytics to be performed.  We may use this technology to deliver or help our Partners deliver certain advertising through mobile applications and browsers based on information associated with your mobile device. If you'd like to opt-out from having ads tailored to you in this way on your mobile device, please follow the instructions in the \"Your Ad Choices\" section below.  By visiting the Service, whether as a registered user or otherwise, you acknowledge, and agree that you are giving us your consent to track your activities and your use of the Service through the technologies described above, as well as similar technologies developed in the future, and that we may use such tracking technologies in the emails we send to you.Our unaffiliated Partners and third parties may themselves set and access their own tracking technologies when you visit our Services and they may have access to information about you and your online activities over time and across different websites or applications when you use the Service. Their use of such tracking technologies is not in our control and is subject to their own privacy policies.   V. Your Ad ChoicesAdvertising enables us to provide the rich content for which Services on the Turner Network are known, and to provide much of this content free of cost to our Users.  Thus, we strive to provide you with ads that are relevant to you and for products you may want.  However, we also offer you choices with regard to interest-based ads.To learn more about interest-based ads and the choices available to you, please visit our Ad Choices page, which has general information about certain companies that place these ads.You may also find more information about entities involved in online advertising and additional choices you may make through the Network Advertising Initiative (\"NAI\") at the NAI Service, and the Digital Advertising Alliance (the \"DAA\") at the DAA consumer choice Service.  Turner is a participant in the online industry's self-regulatory program administered by the DAA and has agreed to adhere to the DAA's principles applicable to interest-based ads.  The tools provided on the Ad Choices page, as well as the DAA opt-out page and the NAI opt-out page are provided by third parties, not Turner. Turner does not control or operate these tools or the choices that advertisers and others provide through these tools.  When using a mobile application you may receive tailored in-application advertisements. Depending on your device, you may be able to reset your mobile device's advertising identifier at any time by accessing the privacy settings on your mobile device. In addition, each operating system, iOS for Apple phones, Android for Android devices and Windows for Microsoft devices, provides its own instructions on how to prevent the delivery of tailored in-application advertisements. You may review the support materials and/or the privacy settings for the respective operating systems in order to opt-out of tailored in-application advertisements.

You must send any such notice to CNN by email to  copyrightagent@turner.com AND by U.S. Mail to Copyright Agent, Legal Department, One CNN Center, Atlanta, GA 30303-2762.  To the extent that CNN has your contact information, it will send any such notice to you by U.S. Mail, or otherwise to your email address.  CNN and you will attempt to resolve any dispute, claim, or controversy through informal negotiation within thirty (30) days from the date that any notice of dispute, claim, or controversy is sent.  CNN and you shall use reasonable, good faith, efforts to settle any dispute, claim, or controversy through consultation and good faith negotiations.  After 30 days, CNN or you may resort to the other alternatives described in this Section.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, the notice and 30 day negotiation period required by this paragraph shall not apply, however, to disputes, claims, or controversies concerning patents, copyrights, moral rights, trademarks, and trade secrets and claims of piracy or unauthorized use of the Sites. Except as otherwise specifically set forth below, any dispute, claim, or controversy of any kind between CNN and you arising under these Terms of Use or in connection with your access to, and/or use of the Site, and/or the provision of content, services, and/or technology on or through the Site, if unresolved through informal discussions within thirty (30) days of receipt of notice, shall be resolved by binding arbitration to be held in the state in which you reside.

The AAA Rules and fee information are available at www.adr.org.CNN shall bear the cost of any arbitration filing fees and arbitration fees for claims of up to $75,000, unless the arbitrator finds the arbitration to be frivolous.  You are responsible for all other additional costs that you may incur in the arbitration including, but not limited to attorney's fees and expert witness costs unless CNN is otherwise specifically required to pay such fees under applicable law.  For claims that total more than $75,000, the AAA Rules will govern payment of filing fees and arbitration fees.  The decision of the arbitrator will be in writing and binding and conclusive on CNN and you, and judgment to enforce the decision may be entered by any court of competent jurisdiction.  CNN and you agree that dispositive motions, including without limitation, motions to dismiss and motions for summary judgment will be allowed in the arbitration. The arbitrator must follow these Terms of Use and can award the same damages and relief as a court, including injunctive or other equitable relief and attorney's fees.

In the event some or all of these arbitration provisions are determined to be unenforceable for any reason, or if a claim, dispute or controversy is brought that is found by a court to be excluded from the scope of these arbitration provisions, CNN and you agree to waive, to the fullest extent allowed by law, any trial by jury.The terms of these arbitration provisions will also apply to any claims asserted by you against any present or future parent or affiliated company of CNN to the extent that any such claims arise out of your access to, and/or use of the Site, and/or the provision of content, services, and/or technology on or through the Site.12.

CNN and you further agree that CNN and you shall not participate in any consolidated, class, or representative proceeding (existing or future) brought by any third party arising under these Terms of Use or in connection with the Site. If any court or arbitrator determines that the class action waiver set forth in this paragraph is void or unenforceable for any reason or that arbitration can proceed on a class basis, then the disputes, claims or controversies will not be subject to arbitration and must be litigated in federal court located in New York, New York. The terms of this provision will also apply to any claims asserted by you against any parent or affiliated company of CNN to the extent that any such claims arise out of your access to, and/or use of the Site, and/or the provision of content, services, and/or technology on or through the Site.13.

IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO ALL OF THESE TERMS, DO NOT ACCESS OR USE THE SERVICES.\nThese Terms of Use (\u201cTerms\u201d) apply to your access to and use of any website, mobile application or other online or mobile product or service (collectively, the \u201cServices\u201d) of Couchsurfing International, Inc. (\u201cCouchsurfing,\u201d \u201cwe\u201d or \u201cus\u201d). If you are using the Services on behalf of any entity, you represent and warrant that you are authorized to accept these Terms on such entity\u2019s behalf and that such entity will be responsible for your violation of these Terms. Failure to use our Services in accordance with these Terms may result in, among other things, termination or suspension of your rights to use the Services and may subject you to legal action by Couchsurfing and/or severe civil and/or criminal penalties.\nWe reserve the right to make changes or modifications to these Terms, or any policy or guideline of our Services, at any time and in our sole discretion. If Couchsurfing makes changes to these Terms, we will provide notice of such changes, including by revising the date at the top of these Terms. Your continued use of our Services following the posting of changes or modifications will constitute your acceptance of such changes or modifications. Accordingly, you should frequently review these Terms and applicable policies and guidelines to understand the terms and conditions that apply to your use of the Services.\nPlease refer to our Privacy Policy for information about how Couchsurfing collects, uses and discloses information about our members. In addition, by accessing or using our Services, you agree to adhere to the Community Guidelines.\nPlease Contact Us with any questions regarding these Terms. You can contact us by mail at PO Box 7775 ECM 86600, San Francisco, CA 94120, by email at support@couchsurfing.com or by phone at +1.415.404.6611.\nELIGIBILITY, REGISTRATION AND ACCOUNT\nYou must be at least 18 years old to access or use the Services. By registering to use our Services, you represent that you are at least 18 years old.\n        In order to access certain areas and features of our Services, you will need to register for an account using either your email address or your login credentials from a third-party social media site. If you register with your email address, you agree to create a unique password that you do not use with any other online product or service.

You acknowledge that such products and services are offered and sold to you by one or more third parties. For more information, please refer to the applicable third party\u2019s terms of sale and privacy policy that are presented as part of the checkout process.\nINTERACTIONS WITH OTHER MEMBERS\n3.1 You Have Sole Responsibility When Interacting with Other Members. Our Services provide a platform for members to learn about one another, arrange stays and travel, engage in activities and communicate with one another. Couchsurfing is not a party to, has no involvement or interest in, makes no representations or warranties as to, and has no responsibility or liability with respect to any communications, transactions, interactions, disputes or any relations whatsoever between you and any other member, person or organization. You are solely responsible for your interactions with other members of our Services. We reserve the right, but have no obligation, to monitor interactions between you and other members of our Services.\nRemember, the Couchsurfing Services are just a platform that enable you to communicate and interact with other people around the world. We cannot be responsible for the interactions that you have with other Couchsurfing members, so please use good judgment and keep safety in mind when you use our Services.\n3.2 Identity Verification. We cannot and do not confirm each member\u2019s identity. Although we provide tools intended to assist with identity verification, such as our address verification tool (as described in Section 3.3), you are solely responsible for determining the identity and suitability of others with whom you may interact through our Services. Couchsurfing does not represent or warrant that our tools are sufficient to determine whether it is appropriate for you to interact with another member. Further, we do not endorse any persons who use or register for our Services. We do not investigate or verify any member\u2019s reputation, conduct, morality, criminal background, or any information members may submit to the Services (other than the address-verification tool as described in Section 3.3). We encourage you to take precautions when interacting with other members, particularly when meeting a stranger in person for the first time.\n3.3 Our Address-Verification Tool. Our address verification tool is intended merely to confirm that the postal address a member submits to us is an address at which that member is able to access or receive mail. Couchsurfing\u2019s address verification tool is not intended to confirm that a member actually resides at a particular address. While this is one of many ways to reduce the risk of misconduct by a member, it is not a guarantee of any member\u2019s identity or good faith.\n3.4 Member-Hosted Events; Couchsurfing Ambassadors. Members may organize in-person meetings and host events for other Couchsurfing members; however, these events are not sponsored or endorsed by Couchsurfing and members attend such meetings and events at their own risk. In addition, Couchsurfing members may sign up to become Couchsurfing Ambassadors (or members of a successor program) and contribute their time to activities that support the Couchsurfing community, such as meeting new members, organizing events and answering questions. Couchsurfing Ambassadors (or members of a successor program) are not agents of Couchsurfing and Couchsurfing is not responsible or liable for any acts or omissions of these members.\n3.5 Release. Because our Services are merely a platform, in the event that you have a dispute with one or more members, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law you release us (and our officers, directors, members, employees, agents and affiliates) from claims, demands and damages (actual and consequential) of every kind and nature, known and unknown, suspected and unsuspected, disclosed and undisclosed, arising out of or in any way connected with such disputes. If you are a California resident, you waive California Civil Code 1542, which says: \u201cA general release does not extend to claims which the creditor does not know or suspect to exist in his favor at the time of executing the release, which if known by him must have materially affected his settlement with the debtor.\u201d\nMEMBER CONDUCT AND CONTENT\nThe Services include interactive areas where you or other members can create, post or store content, messages, materials, data, information, text, music, sound, photos, videos, graphics or other items or materials on the Services (collectively, \u201cMember Content\u201d). You are solely responsible for your use of such interactive areas and agree that your use of these areas is at your own risk.\n4.1 Member Content Restrictions. You are solely responsible for any Member Content that you submit, post or transmit via our Services. You agree not to post, upload to, transmit, distribute, store, create or otherwise publish through the Services, Member Content that we believe, in our sole discretion:\n(a) is unlawful, libelous, defamatory, harassing, threatening, invasive of privacy or publicity rights, or that would otherwise create liability or violate any local, state, national or international law;\n(b) contains nudity, sexually explicit content or is otherwise obscene, pornographic, indecent, lewd, suggestive or sexually exploitative of minors;\n(c) may disparage any ethnic, racial, sexual or religious group by stereotypical depiction or is otherwise abusive or inflammatory;\n(d) depicts the use of illicit drugs;\n(e) contains offensive language or images or is otherwise objectionable;\n(f) incites violence or characterizes violence as acceptable, glamorous or desirable;\n(g) contains unsolicited promotions, political campaigning, advertising or solicitations, without our prior written consent;\n(h) contains private or personal information about another person, unless such person has agreed to the disclosure of this information;\n(i) contains viruses, corrupted data or other harmful, disruptive or destructive file viruses, cancel bots, Trojan horses, harmful code, flood pings, denial-of-service attacks, packet or IP spoofing, forged routing or electronic mail address information or similar methods or technology;\n(j) may infringe any patent, trademark, trade secret, copyright or other intellectual or proprietary right of any party.

We have no obligation to post Member Content from you or anyone else and we may, in our sole discretion, edit, remove or delete any Member Content without notice. If you become aware of Member Content that violates these Terms, you may notify of us such content  by using the reporting tools provided on our Services. Enforcement of these Terms, however, is solely in our discretion and the absence of enforcement in some instances does not waive of our right to enforce the Terms in other instances. In addition, these Terms do not create a private right of action on the part of any third party or any reasonable expectation that the Services will not contain any content that is prohibited by such rules.\n4.2 Member Conduct. By accessing or using the Services, you agree to act responsibly, exercise good judgment and comply with the Community Guidelines.

IN NO EVENT WILL OUR AGGREGATE LIABILITY TO YOU OR ANY THIRD PARTY IN ANY MATTER ARISING FROM OR RELATING TO OUR SERVICES OR THESE TERMS EXCEED THE SUM OF ONE HUNDRED US DOLLARS ($100).\n16.4. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF CERTAIN WARRANTIES OR THE LIMITATION OR EXCLUSION OF LIABILITY FOR INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES. ACCORDINGLY, SOME OF THE LIMITATIONS OF SECTIONS 16 AND 17 MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.\n16.5 NOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING TO THE CONTRARY IN THESE TERMS, NOTHING IN THESE TERMS EXCLUDES OR LIMITS OUR LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY CAUSED BY OUR NEGLIGENCE OR FOR FRAUD.\nINDEMNITY\nYou shall defend, indemnify and hold harmless Couchsurfing (and each of our officers, directors, members, employees, agents and affiliates) from any claim, demand, action, damage, loss, cost or expense, including without limitation reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees, arising out of or relating to (a) your use of our Services; (b) any Member Content or Submissions you provide; (c) your violation of these Terms; (d) your violation of any rights of another; or (e) your conduct in connection with the Services. Further, if you are using the Services on behalf of any entity, you represent and warrant that such entity agrees to indemnify you and Couchsurfing for violations of these Terms in accordance with this Section. If you are obligated to indemnify us, we will have the right, in our sole and unfettered discretion, to control any action or proceeding and determine whether we wish to settle it, and if so, on what terms.\nREPORTING MISCONDUCT\nIf you interact with anyone through our Services who you feel is acting or has acted inappropriately, including but not limited to offensive, violent or sexually inappropriate behavior, who steals from you or engages in any other disturbing conduct, we strongly encourage you to immediately report such person to the appropriate authorities and to us by contacting us using the Couchsurfing Help Center. Please note that although we encourage you to report misconduct, we are not responsible or liable for our members\u2019 actions, and we are not obligated to take any action.\nDISPUTES.\nPLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING PARAGRAPH CAREFULLY BECAUSE IT REQUIRES YOU TO ARBITRATE DISPUTES WITH COUCHSURFING AND IT LIMITS THE MANNER IN WHICH YOU CAN SEEK RELIEF. You and Couchsurfing agree to arbitrate any dispute arising from these Terms or relating to the Services, except that you and Couchsurfing are not required to arbitrate any dispute in which either party seeks equitable or other relief for the alleged unlawful use of copyrights, trademarks, trade names, logos, trade secrets or patents. SUBJECT TO ANY RIGHTS YOU MAY HAVE UNDER APPLICABLE LAW, ARBITRATION PREVENTS YOU FROM SUING IN COURT OR FROM HAVING A JURY TRIAL. You and Couchsurfing agree that you will notify each other of any dispute within thirty (30) days of when it arises, that you will attempt informal resolution prior to any demand for arbitration, that any arbitration will occur in San Francisco, California and that arbitration will be conducted confidentially by a single arbitrator in accordance with the Rules of the American Arbitration Association. You and Couchsurfing also agree that the state or federal courts in San Francisco County, California have exclusive jurisdiction over any appeals of an arbitration award and over any suit between the parties not subject to arbitration. Other than class procedures and remedies discussed below, the arbitrator has the authority to grant any remedy that would otherwise be available in court. WHETHER THE DISPUTE IS HEARD IN ARBITRATION OR IN COURT, YOU AND COUCHSURFING WILL NOT COMMENCE AGAINST THE OTHER A CLASS ACTION, CLASS ARBITRATION OR OTHER REPRESENTATIVE ACTION OR PROCEEDING.\nMISCELLANEOUS.\n20.1 Assignment. You may not assign any of your rights or obligations under these Terms without prior written consent from Couchsurfing. Couchsurfing may assign any or all of its rights under these Terms, in whole or in part, without obtaining your consent or approval.\n20.2 Entire Agreement. These Terms contain the entire agreement, and supersede all prior and contemporaneous understandings, between the parties regarding their subject matter.\n20.3 Waiver. Our failure or delay in exercising any right, power or privilege under these Terms shall not operate as a waiver thereof.\n20.4 Severability. The invalidity or unenforceability of any of these Terms shall not affect the validity or enforceability of any other of these Terms, all of which shall remain in full force and effect.\n20.5 Headings. Headings of sections are for convenience only and shall not be used to limit or construe such sections.\n20.7 Survival. Sections 3.5 (Release), 4 (Member Conduct and Content), 5 (Submissions), 9 (Trademarks), 11 (Third-Party Content), 14 (Member\u2019s Representations and Warranties), 15 (Disclaimer of Warranties), 16 (Limits on Liability), 17 (Indemnity), 19 (Disputes), and this Section 20 (Miscellaneous) shall survive any termination or expiration of these Terms.\n \n \n"}, "coursera.org": {"https://www.coursera.org/about/cookies": "Please use amodern browser with JavaScript enabled to use Coursera.\u8bf7\u4e0b\u8f7d\u73b0\u4ee3\u7684\u6d4f\u89c8\u5668\uff08IE10\u6216Google Chrome\uff09\u6765\u4f7f\u7528Coursera\u3002Please use amodern browser with JavaScript enabled to use Coursera.\n", "https://www.coursera.org/about/privacy": "Please use amodern browser with JavaScript enabled to use Coursera.\u8bf7\u4e0b\u8f7d\u73b0\u4ee3\u7684\u6d4f\u89c8\u5668\uff08IE10\u6216Google Chrome\uff09\u6765\u4f7f\u7528Coursera\u3002Please use amodern browser with JavaScript enabled to use Coursera.\n", "https://www.coursera.org/about/terms": "Please use amodern browser with JavaScript enabled to use Coursera.\u8bf7\u4e0b\u8f7d\u73b0\u4ee3\u7684\u6d4f\u89c8\u5668\uff08IE10\u6216Google Chrome\uff09\u6765\u4f7f\u7528Coursera\u3002Please use amodern browser with JavaScript enabled to use Coursera.\n"}, "craigslist.org": {"http://www.craigslist.org/about/privacy_policy": "\ncraigslist | Page Not Found\n"}, "del.icio.us": {"https://del.icio.us/privacy": "\nDelicious\nAlready a member?

For simplicity, we'll refer to any or all of this as the \"Service\".\nWe provide this Privacy Policy so you know what we do regarding the collection, use and disclosure of personal information we receive from users of the Service. This Privacy Policy applies only to information that you provide to us through the Service. Your use of the Service is your consent to the collection, disclosure, transfer, processing, storage and other uses of your information as described in this Privacy Policy.\nWe take your privacy very seriously.\nWe collect your information to provide and improve our Service and increase your enjoyment in using it.\nProviding us with your Personal Information is your choice.\nYou may use certain features of the Service without registering; however, to get access to all the features of the Service you will need to register at which time you will be asked to provide certain information most of which is optional. The only information you are required to provide is your name, (which will be publicly visible), a user name (which will be publicly visible), your email (which will not be publicly visible) and a password (which will not be publicly visible). All other information you provide when registering or later add to your profile is optional. Additional profile information you choose to provide, including your name, will be publicly available.\nPersonal Information is information that can be used to contact or identify you. Personal Information includes, but is not limited to, your name and email address. We use your Personal Information to provide the Service and administer your inquiries. We will also use your Personal Information to contact you with Delicious newsletters, marketing or promotional materials and other information that may be of interest to you. If you decide at any time that you no longer wish to receive such communications from us, please follow the unsubscribe instructions provided in any of the communications or update your \"Settings\" information. (See \"Changing or Deleting Information,\" below.) We do not collect Personal Information from users who are not registered.\nNon-Identifying Information is the other information that you provide as part of registration and the administration and personalization of your user experience examples may include: zip code (on its own), gender and geolocation. We may use Non-Identifying Information alone or aggregated with the Non-Identifying Information of other users to attempt to provide you with a better experience, to improve the quality and value of the Service and to analyze and understand how our Service is used. We may also use the combination of your Personal and Non-Identifying information without aggregating it to serve you specifically, for instance to deliver a product to you according to your preferences or restrictions.\nService Usage Information. When you use our Service our servers automatically record information that your browser sends whenever you visit a website or online service (\"Log Data\"), including, but not limited to, your computer's Internet Protocol (\"IP\") address, browser type or the webpage you were visiting before you came to our Site, pages of our Site that you visit, the time spent on those pages, information you search for via our Service, access times and dates, and other statistics. We use this information to monitor and analyze use of the Service (e.g., to understand how our users interact with advertisements), for the Service's technical administration, to increase our Service's functionality and user-friendliness, and to better tailor it to our visitors' needs. We do not treat Log Data as Personal Information, though we may aggregate, analyze and evaluate such information for the same purposes as stated above regarding other Non-Identifying Information.\nLike many websites and online services, we use \"cookies\" on our Service to collect information. A cookie is a small data file that we transfer to your computer's hard disk. Most Internet browsers automatically accept cookies. We may use both session cookies and persistent cookies to better understand how you interact with our Service, to save your preferences and personalize the Service for you, to monitor aggregate usage by Delicious Users and web traffic routing on our Service and to improve our Service generally. Third party advertisers may also place or read cookies on your browser. You can instruct your browser, by changing its options, to stop accepting cookies or to prompt you before accepting a cookie from the websites you visit. If you do not accept cookies, however, you may not be able to use all portions of the Site or all functionality of the Service. \nWe also use \"pixel tags,\" \"clear GIFs\" or similar means (individually or collectively \"Pixel Tags\") on our Site. A Pixel Tag is an electronic image, often a single pixel, embedded on web pages. Pixel Tags are ordinarily not visible to users. Pixel Tags allow us to count the number of Delicious Users who have visited certain pages of the Site, to deliver branded services and to generate statistics about how our Site is used.\nPersonal Information. Your user name, name, and any profile information you choose to add will be publicly available so consider whether you want to any include Personal Information in your profile. Content you add to the Service (things like links, comments, notes, titles, etc.) will be publicly available unless you choose to mark your submission as 'private' and you should keep in mind that your user name (and hence your profile and everything in it) will be associated with all such public submissions. Any User Content marked private will only be viewable to you and those users to whom you explicitly grant access. Other than the foregoing, we do not share Personal Information with third parties except as follows:\nThird Party Social Networking Services. Registered users may link their accounts with certain third party social networking services (\"SNSs\"). In these instances, with your permission and on your behalf, we will share your Personal Information, including, but not limited to, information contained in your profile and any bookmarks with the applicable SNS. Through use of such services' APIs we also receive certain information (which may include your Personal Information) in accordance with the privacy settings you have set in your SNS account, if any. Other than what we may share with the SNS in connection with your linking of accounts, the personal information an SNS has about you is obtained by the SNS independent of our Service. Other services follow different rules regarding the use or disclosure of the personal information you submit to them. We encourage you to read the privacy policies or statements of the other services you use.\nService Providers. We may employ third party companies and individuals to facilitate our Service, to provide the Service on our behalf, to perform Site-related services (e.g., without limitation, maintenance services, database management, web analytics and improvement of the Service's features) or to assist us in analyzing how our Service is used. These third parties may have access to your Personal Information only to perform these tasks on our behalf and are obligated not to disclose or use it for any other purpose.\nCompliance with Laws and Law Enforcement. We may disclose any of your information if we believe that it is reasonably necessary to comply with a law, regulation or legal request; to protect the safety of any person; to address fraud, security or technical issues; or to protect Delicious Science' rights or property.\nBusiness Transfers. Delicious Media may sell, transfer or otherwise share some or all of its assets, including your Personal Information, in connection with a merger, acquisition, reorganization or sale of assets or in the event of bankruptcy. We will provide you with notice of the transfer of your Personal Information to the new entity.\nNon-Identifying and Service Usage Information. We may share Non-Identifying Information and Service Usage Information in aggregated or non-aggregated formats with third parties for industry analysis, demographic profiling and other purposes. Any information shared in these contexts will not contain your Personal Information.\nThird-Party Service Providers: Certain third parties perform service functions on our behalf, including, but not limited to, marketing and analytics. These entities may have access to personally identifiable information if needed to perform their functions.\nBusiness Partners and Other Third Parties: From time to time, we may share your personally identifiable information with our business partners.\nAll registered users may review, update, correct or delete the Personal Information in their registration profile by contacting us or via the \"Settings\" section of the Site. If you completely delete all such information, then your account may become deactivated. If you would like us to delete your record in our system, please contact us with a request that we delete your Personal Information from our database. We will use commercially reasonable efforts to honor your request. We may retain an archived copy of your records as required by law or for legitimate business purposes.\nDelicious Media is very concerned with safeguarding your information. We employ reasonable physical, technological, and administrative security measures and attempt to ensure they are applicable under the circumstances (e.g., we encrypt certain information using secure socket layer technology (SSL)). No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however. Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.\nWe will make any legally required disclosures of any breach of the security, confidentiality, or integrity of your unencrypted electronically stored \"personal data\" (as defined in applicable state statutes on security breach notification) to you via email or conspicuous posting on the Site in the most expedient time possible and without unreasonable delay, insofar as consistent with (i) the legitimate needs of law enforcement or (ii) any measures necessary to determine the scope of the breach and restore the reasonable integrity of the data system.\nYour information may be transferred to - and maintained on - computers located outside of your state, province, country or other governmental jurisdiction where the privacy laws may not be as protective as those in your jurisdiction. If you are located outside the United States and choose to provide information to us, Delicious Media transfers Personal Information to the United States and processes it there. Your consent to this Privacy Policy by using the Service followed by your submission of such information represents your agreement to that transfer.\nOur Service contains links to other websites. If you choose to visit an advertiser or third party website by \"clicking on\" a third party link, you will be directed to that third party's website. The fact that we link to a website is not an endorsement, authorization or representation of our affiliation with that third party, nor is it an endorsement of their privacy or information security policies or practices. We do not exercise control over third party websites or over the choice of which third party sites are linked to using the service. These other websites may place their own cookies or other files on your computer, collect data or solicit personal information from you. Other sites follow different rules regarding the use or disclosure of the personal information you submit to them. We encourage you to read the privacy policies or statements of the other websites you visit.\nThis Service is not directed to children under 13. We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under 13. If we become aware that a child under 13 has provided us with Personal Information, we will delete such information from our files.\nDelicious Media may, its sole discretion, choose to modify, discontinue or terminate the Service, at any time and without prior notice. Delicious Media may also choose to modify the Terms. Once they become effective your continued use of the Service will mean you agree to be bound by the new terms. If you don't agree then you need to stop using the Service.\nWe allow third-party companies to collect certain information when you visit our web site. These companies may utilize cookies, pixels or other technologies to collect and use user information (e.g., hashed, de-identified, data, click stream information, browser type, time and date, subject of advertisements clicked or scrolled over) during your visits to this and other web sites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services likely to be of greater interest to you. To learn more about this behavioral advertising practice or to opt-out of this type of advertising, you can visit the websites of the Digital Advertising Alliance at www.aboutads.info and Your Online Choices at http://www.youronlinechoices.com/uk/.\n---About\n---Apps\n---Branding\n---Copyright\n---Help\n---Privacy\n---RSS\n---Terms\n---Tools\n", "https://del.icio.us/terms": "\nDelicious\nAlready a member?

For simplicity, we'll refer to any or all of this as the \"Service\".\nWhen you access or use the Service, you are agreeing to the following terms and conditions (\"Terms\") and acknowledge that they are a binding legal agreement between you and Delicious Media.\nBy accessing or using the Service on behalf of an organization, like a company, you are also agreeing to these Terms on behalf of that organization and saying that you are authorized to do that on behalf of your organization.\nOur goal is to provide a valuable and enjoyable service through which users can share and discover the \"tastiest\" web content. Please read all of these Terms, and the Delicious Privacy Policy to be sure you understand how it all works. Here are a few basic principles (more details on these are further down):\nWhat's yours is yours and vice versa. When you add content to the service you are NOT giving us ownership of what you added. Likewise, we are not giving you ownership of anything belonging to Delicious Media. You are giving us certain rights to use things you add to the Service as part of our operation of the Service and we are giving you the right to use the Service.\nContent you put on the Service may be public so consider carefully what you add and how you add it. The Delicious Privacy Policy gives you full details on what is public and what is private. Be good and play nicely. The Service is only provided for lawful purposes and not for engaging in or promoting illegal activity. Also, don't do things that would harm the Service or make it less enjoyable for others.\nWho Can Use Delicious?\nThe Service is intended solely for persons who are 13 or older. If you are not 13 or older, do not use the Service. If you use or access the Service you are telling us that you are 13 or older. You may use the Service only as allowed by these Terms and all applicable laws. If something you want to do on the Service violates the Terms or the law, don't do it.\nCan I connect the Service to my account on a social network like Twitter, Facebook or Linkedin?\nYes! We have enabled linking your Delicious account to other social networks and will be adding more over time. When you choose to create an account on the Service you will have the opportunity to register with and/or link the Service to certain other services on which you are a member, things like Twitter, Facebook and Linkedin. You may also choose to link to these services after creating your account. You do NOT need to register via another site or connect the Service to your other accounts, but if you do please be aware that you are authorizing us to access your account information on those other sites on your behalf. See the Delicious Privacy Policy for more details.\nWhat happens when I add something to the Service?\nWe'll use the term, \"User Content\" to mean anything and everything a user adds to the Service. The most common thing users will add are links they save, information about those links like tags or titles, and notes they add to those links. This information may be publicly available depending on the user's privacy selections. See the Delicious Privacy Policy for more details.\nYour User Content is yours and User Content added by others is theirs. By adding something to the Service you are not giving Delicious Media or anyone else ownership of that User Content.\nWhen you put User Content on the Service, you do give us (and our service providers, partners and other users) free and unlimited rights to use your User Content as part of the Service including as the Service may evolve in the future. This means we can use, including copying, modifying etc. what you put on the Service as part of running the Service worldwide and including things like enabling it on different devices and platforms. For example, this license allows us to make your public links and related information available to others as part of their use of the Service. This also means that other users of the Service can use your publicly available content as part of their use of the Service.\nYou are responsible for what you do on the Service.\nYou are responsible for your use of the Service and all of your User Content, we are not responsible or liable for any use of your User Content. Depending on your privacy settings, your User Content may be used by us, other users, and our partners. If you don't have the right to submit your User Content for such use, it may subject you to liability. When you add content to the Service you are representing that you have all the necessary rights to do so and to enable others to use the content as described in these Terms.\nCan I remove content I add to the Service?\nYes, you may remove your User Content from the Service at any time by specifically marking it for deletion or terminating your Account. If you choose to remove your User Content or to terminate your Account, your User Content will be removed from our systems in a commercially reasonable amount of time (e.g., time enough to allow our services to update), provided, however, we may retain an archived copy as required by law. In addition, in certain instances, copies of your User Content may continue to exist in published or recorded form when it has been retransmitted, redistributed, or otherwise licensed to others as contemplated in these Terms. For instance, once an RSS feed has been downloaded we do not have the ability to change that download; so, if you delete something after that RSS feed has been downloaded what you deleted will not be deleted from the downloaded copy. Likewise, to the extent that search engines or others archive pages it's possible your content will remain available through those search engines even though it's not available on the live version of our site (or even in any cached versions we maintain).\nShould I back-up my content?\nYes, and Delicious Media provides registered users with simple export options to do this. While we do not anticipate an event where a user's information would be lost, we cannot guarantee it will never happen. Therefore, it's your responsibility to back-up your User Content. You agree that Delicious Media is not responsible or liable for the deletion of, or the failure to store or to transmit any User Content. Users whose accounts have been terminated by Delicious Media as allowed in these Terms will need to contact Delicious Media directly if they wish to obtain a copy of the User Content they added. Delicious Media will consider such requests on a case by case basis and is under no obligation to grant such request or provide such information.\nWe are not Big Brother.\nDelicious Media has no obligation to monitor your access to or use of the Service or to review or edit any User Content you choose to add and we do not do so as part of our normal operations; however, Delicious Media has the right to do these things for the purpose of operating the Service, to ensure your compliance with these Terms and applicable laws. Delicious Media reserves the right, at any time and without prior notice, to remove or disable access to any content on the Service that Delicious Media, in its sole discretion, considers to be objectionable for any reason, in violation of these Terms or otherwise harmful to the Service.\nWe are also not your Mother, but we do want you to be careful when crossing the Internet.\nThe Service contains links to other websites that our users have shared. If you choose to click on a link and go to another site you may be exposed to content that is offensive, harmful, inaccurate or otherwise inappropriate. If you aren't sure a site is safe and inoffensive to you, don't click on the link. If you click a link and something bad happens when you visit another site we are not responsible or liable in any way. We're not responsible for the content of other sites and we're not responsible for links users share on the Service. Just because a user has shared a link does not mean it's safe and the fact that the link is on the Service does not mean we have checked it, endorsed it or otherwise determined it is ok for you to visit -- we have not. You assume all risk from visiting sites linked to on the Service.\nCopyrights and Trademarks: Don't Infringe Other People's Rights!\nDelicious Media respects copyright and trademark laws and expects its users to do the same. Delicious Media has adopted and implemented a policy that tells copyright owners how to notify us if they believe content on the Service infringes their rights. Please see the Delicious Copyright Policy for further information.\nWe have the right to and will terminate users' accounts if they repeatedly infringe or are believed to be repeatedly infringing other people's rights. We also reserve the right to require a user to change their username for any reason including infringement of someone's rights.\nBy the way, copyright and trademark laws also protect the Service and Delicious Media exclusively owns all rights to the Service except as expressly provided in these Terms. All trademarks, service marks, logos, trade names and any other proprietary designations of Delicious Media used herein are trademarks or registered trademarks of Delicious Media. Any other trademarks, service marks, logos, trade names and any other proprietary designations are the trademarks or registered trademarks of their respective parties.\nWhat not to Do\nMost of this should be pretty obvious, but here's a list just to make sure people are clear on some of the details of what it's not ok to do on the Service:\nDO NOT:\n---Post, submit or transmit any User Content that constitutes a direct, specific threat of violence against another;\n---Use the Service for an unlawful purpose or for promotion of illegal activities;\n---Impersonate others through the Service in a manner that does or is intended to mislead, confuse or deceive others;\n---Access, tamper with, or use non-public areas of the Service, Delicious Media's computer systems, or the technical delivery systems of Delicious Media's providers;\n---Attempt to probe, scan, or test the vulnerability of any Delicious Media system or network or breach any security or authentication measures;\n---Avoid, bypass, remove, deactivate, impair, descramble or otherwise circumvent any technological measure implemented by Delicious Media or any of Delicious Media's providers or any other third party (including another user) to protect the Service or any content on the Service;\n---Attempt to access or search the Service or any content on the service or download any content from the Service through the use of any engine, software, tool, agent, device or mechanism (including spiders, robots, crawlers, data mining tools or the like) other than the software and/or search agents provided by Delicious Media or other generally available third party web browsers;\n---Send any unsolicited or unauthorized advertising, promotional materials, email, junk mail, spam, chain letters or other form of solicitation;\n---Forge any TCP/IP packet header or any part of the header information in any email or newsgroup posting, or in any way use the Service to send altered, deceptive or false source-identifying information;\n---Interfere with, or attempt to interfere with, the access of any user, host or network, including, without limitation, sending a virus, intentionally linking to malicious content, overloading, flooding, spamming, or mail-bombing the Service;\n---Collect or store any personally identifiable information from the Service from other users of the Service without their express permission; or encourage or enable any other individual to do any of the foregoing.\nWhen it's Over\nIf you violate any of these Terms, your permission to use the Service may be suspended or permanently revoked. We reserve the right to suspend, disable or terminate your Account, in our sole discretion and without prior notice to you, with or without cause. You may cancel your Account at any time via the \"Settings\" section of your Account.\nGot Feedback?\nAny feedback, comments and suggestions for improvements to the Service that you submit to Delicious Media (\"Feedback\") will be the sole and exclusive property of Delicious Media and by submitting such Feedback you irrevocably assign to Delicious Media and agree to irrevocably assign to Delicious Media all of your rights in all such Feedback, including all related intellectual property rights. Your submission of any Feedback to Delicious Media is entirely voluntary and we will be free to use such Feedback as we choose and without any obligation to you.\nDelicious Bookmarklet\nIf you choose to install the Delicious Bookmarklet the following further terms and conditions also apply in addition to those above and below this \"Delicious Bookmarklet\" section:\nDelicious Bookmarklet License.

Cookies are text files containing small amounts of information which are downloaded to your computer or mobile device when you visit a website. Cookies are then sent back to the originating website on each subsequent visit, or to another website that recognizes that cookie. A pixel tag (also called a web beacon or clear GIF) is a tiny graphic with a unique identifier, embedded invisibly on a webpage (or an online ad or email) that links web pages to particular web servers and their cookies, and may be used for a variety of purposes, such as counting the number of visitors to the Sites, analyzing how users navigate around the Sites, assessing what content or ads are viewed or clicked on by our visitors. Some ad companies and game developers use \u201cflash cookies\u201d for ads and games that use Flash media technology. We use the term \u201ccookies\u201d in this policy to refer to cookies and all such similar technologies.\nCookies are widely used in order to make websites work, or to work more efficiently, as well as to provide information to the owners of the site. We use these technologies to let you navigate between pages efficiently, remember your preferences, track your use of the Services and generally improve your experience. Ad companies we work with place cookies on your computer to track your activities across various sites so that they can display ads on our Sites and third party websites that are more relevant to you and your interests.\nThere are two broad categories of cookies:\nFirst party cookies, served directly by us to your computer or mobile device.\nThird party cookies, which are served by a third party on our behalf. We use third party cookies for functionality, performance / analytics, advertising and social media purposes.\nCookies can remain on your computer or mobile device for different periods of time. Some cookies are \u2018session cookies\u2019, meaning that they exist only while your browser is open. These are deleted automatically once you close your browser. Other cookies are \u2018permanent cookies\u2019, meaning that they survive after your browser is closed. They can be used by websites to recognize your computer when you open your browser and browse the Internet again.\nHOW DO WE USE COOKIES? We use cookies to:\n\u2022\ttrack traffic flow and patterns of travel in connection with our Services;\n\u2022\tunderstand the total number of visitors to our sites on an ongoing basis and the types of internet browsers (e.g. Chrome, Safari or Edge), operating systems (e.g. Windows or Mac OS), and screen resolutions used by our visitors;\n\u2022\tmonitor and analyze the performance of our Services and to continually improve them;\n\u2022\tcustomize and enhance your online experience; and\n \u2022\tenable Dictionary and third-party advertising both on and off our Sites.\nThird parties whose products or services are accessible or advertised through the Services, including social networking services, may also use cookies or similar tools, and we advise you to check their privacy policies for information about their cookies and other practices. We do not control the practices of such partners and their privacy policies govern their interactions with you. We encourage you to read their privacy policies.\n--- WHAT TYPES OF COOKIES DO WE USE? The types of cookies used by us and our partners in connection with the Services can be classified into one of the five categories below. We\u2019ve set out some further information about each category, and the purposes of the cookies we and third parties set in the following table.\nTYPE OF COOKIE\nWHAT IT DOES\nStrictly Necessary Cookies\nThese cookies are essential to operate the Sites and provide the Services by helping us provide basic functionality such as loading and rendering pages on the Sites and enabling your navigation around the Sites and use of certain features. They are also used to identify and prevent fraud and improve security.\nFunctionality Cookies\nFunctionality cookies record information about choices you\u2019ve made and allow us to tailor the Sites to you. These cookies mean that when you continue to use or come back to the Sites, we can provide you with our Services as you have asked for them to be provided. For example, these cookies allow us to store language preference. They may also be used to provide certain functionality such as playing video content.\nPerformance / Analytics Cookies\nWe use performance/analytics cookies to analyze how the Sites are accessed, used, or is performing in order to provide you with a better user experience and to maintain, operate and continually improve the Sites. For example, these cookies allow us to:\n---Better understand our website visitors so that we can improve how we present our content;\n---Test different design ideas for particular pages, such as our homepage;\n---Collect information about site visitors such as where they are located and what browsers they are using;\n---Determine the number of unique users of the Sites;\n---Improve the Sites by measuring any errors that occur; and\n---Conduct research and diagnostics to improve product offerings.\nAdvertising and Tracking Cookies\nAs you use our Sites, you will notice that it includes advertising. We allow third party advertising companies to place cookies on our Sites. These cookies enable such companies to track your activity across various sites where they display ads and record your activities so they can show ads that they consider relevant to you as you browse the web.\nCookies also allow us and third parties to know whether you\u2019ve seen an ad or a type of ad, and how long it has been since you\u2019ve last seen it. This information is used for frequency capping purposes, to help tailor the ads you see, and to measure the effectiveness of ads.\nSocial Media Cookies\nThird parties that make their applications available through/on our Sites may set their own cookies in order to track the performance of their applications or customize those applications for you. For example, when you share an article using a social media sharing button on our Sites (e.g., Facebook, Twitter, or Instagram), the social network that has created the button will record that you have done this. Because of how cookies work, we cannot access these cookies, nor can the third parties access the data in cookies used by us. Some pages of our website may also contain embedded content, such as video content from YouTube, and these sites may set their own cookies.\n---COOKIE CONTROLS. You can control your cookie settings as explained below. We may disclose your opt-out choices to third parties so that they can honor your preferences in accordance with applicable laws.\n \t\u2022\t Web Browser Controls. Most browsers allow you to change your cookie settings. Users can usually set their browsers to block all third-party cookies (which are those set by third-party companies collecting information on websites operated by other companies), block all cookies (including first-party cookies such as the ones We uses to collect search activity information about its users), or block specific cookies. These settings will typically be found in the \u201coptions\u201d or \u201cpreferences\u201d menu of your browser. In order to understand these settings, the following links may be helpful, otherwise you should use the \u201cHelp\u201d option in your browser for more details.\n\u2022\tCookie settings in Microsoft Edge\n\u2022\tCookie settings in Internet Explorer\n\u2022\tCookie settings in Firefox\n\u2022\tCookie settings in Chrome\n\u2022\tCookie settings in Safari web and iOS.\nWe note that an optional browser setting known as Do Not Track allows you to express your preferences regarding tracking by advertisers and other third-parties. However, we do not recognize or respond to browser-initiated DNT signals, as the Internet industry is currently still working toward defining exactly what DNT means, what it means to comply with DNT, and a common approach to responding to DNT.\n\u2022\tFlash Cookie Controls.

These terms of service (\u201cTerms\u201d) cover your use and access to our services, client software and websites (\"Services\"). If you reside outside of the United States of America, Canada and Mexico (\u201cNorth America\u201d) your agreement is with Dropbox International Unlimited Company, and if you reside in North America your agreement is with Dropbox, Inc. Our Privacy Policy explains how we collect and use your information while our Acceptable Use Policy outlines your responsibilities when using our Services. By using our Services, you\u2019re agreeing to be bound by these Terms, our Privacy Policy, and Acceptable Use Policy. If you\u2019re using our Services for an organization, you\u2019re agreeing to these Terms on behalf of that organization.\nWhen you use our Services, you provide us with things like your files, content, messages, contacts, and so on (\u201cYour Stuff\u201d). Your Stuff is yours. These Terms don\u2019t give us any rights to Your Stuff except for the limited rights that enable us to offer the Services.\nWe need your permission to do things like hosting Your Stuff, backing it up, and sharing it when you ask us to. Our Services also provide you with features like photo thumbnails, document previews, commenting, easy sorting, editing, sharing, and searching. These and other features may require our systems to access, store, and scan Your Stuff. You give us permission to do those things, and this permission extends to our affiliates and trusted third parties we work with.\nOur Services let you share Your Stuff with others, so please think carefully about what you share.\nYou\u2019re responsible for your conduct. Your Stuff and you must comply with our Acceptable Use Policy. Content in the Services may be protected by others\u2019 intellectual property rights. Please don\u2019t copy, upload, download, or share content unless you have the right to do so.\nWe may review your conduct and content for compliance with these Terms and our Acceptable Use Policy. With that said, we have no obligation to do so. We aren\u2019t responsible for the content people post and share via the Services.\nHelp us keep you informed and Your Stuff protected. Safeguard your password to the Services, and keep your account information current. Don\u2019t share your account credentials or give others access to your account.\nYou may use our Services only as permitted by applicable law, including export control laws and regulations. Finally, to use our Services, you must be at least 13, or in some cases, even older. If you live in France, Germany, or the Netherlands, you must be at least 16. Please check your local law for the age of digital consent. If you don\u2019t meet these age requirements, you may not use the Services.\nSome of our Services allow you to download client software (\u201cSoftware\u201d) which may update automatically. So long as you comply with these Terms, we give you a limited, nonexclusive, nontransferable, revocable license to use the Software, solely to access the Services. To the extent any component of the Software may be offered under an open source license, we\u2019ll make that license available to you and the provisions of that license may expressly override some of these Terms. Unless the following restrictions are prohibited by law, you agree not to reverse engineer or decompile the Services, attempt to do so, or assist anyone in doing so.\nWe sometimes release products and features that we are still testing and evaluating. Those Services have been marked beta, preview, early access, or evaluation (or with words or phrases with similar meanings) and may not be as reliable as Dropbox\u2019s other services, so please keep that in mind.\nThe Services are protected by copyright, trademark, and other US and foreign laws. These Terms don\u2019t grant you any right, title, or interest in the Services, others\u2019 content in the Services, Dropbox trademarks, logos and other brand features. We welcome feedback, but note that we may use comments or suggestions without any obligation to you.\nWe respect the intellectual property of others and ask that you do too. We respond to notices of alleged copyright infringement if they comply with the law, and such notices should be reported using our Copyright Policy. We reserve the right to delete or disable content alleged to be infringing and terminate accounts of repeat infringers. Our designated agent for notice of alleged copyright infringement on the Services is:\nCopyright Agent\n    Dropbox, Inc.\n    333 Brannan Street\n    San Francisco, CA 94107\n    copyright@dropbox.com\nBilling. You can increase your storage space and add paid features to your account (turning your account into a \"Paid Account\"). We\u2019ll automatically bill you from the date you convert to a Paid Account and on each periodic renewal until cancellation. If you\u2019re on an annual plan, we\u2019ll send you a notice email reminding you that your plan is about to renew within a reasonable period of time prior to the renewal date. You\u2019re responsible for all applicable taxes, and we\u2019ll charge tax when required to do so. Some countries have mandatory local laws regarding your cancellation rights, and this paragraph doesn\u2019t override these laws.\nNo Refunds. You may cancel your Dropbox Paid Account at any time. Refunds are only issued if required by law. For example, users living in the European Union have the right to cancel their Paid Account subscriptions within 14 days of signing up for, upgrading to, or renewing a Paid Account.\nDowngrades. Your Paid Account will remain in effect until it's cancelled or terminated under these Terms. If you don\u2019t pay for your Paid Account on time, we reserve the right to suspend it or reduce your storage to free space levels.\nChanges. We may change the fees in effect but will give you advance notice of these changes via a message to the email address associated with your account.\nEmail address. If you sign up for a Dropbox account with an email address provisioned by your organization, your organization may be able to block your use of Dropbox until you transition to an account on a Dropbox team (e.g., Dropbox Business or Dropbox Education plans) or you associate your Dropbox account with a personal email address.\nUsing Dropbox Teams. If you join a Dropbox team, you must use it in compliance with your organization's terms and policies. Please note that Dropbox team accounts are subject to your organization's control. Your administrators may be able to access, disclose, restrict, or remove information in or from your Dropbox team account. They may also be able to restrict or terminate your access to a Dropbox team account. If you convert an existing Dropbox account into part of a Dropbox team, your administrators may prevent you from later disassociating your account from the Dropbox team.\nYou\u2019re free to stop using our Services at any time. We reserve the right to suspend or terminate your access to the Services with notice to you if:\n(a) you\u2019re in breach of these Terms,\n(b) your use of the Services in a manner that would cause a real risk of harm or loss to us or other users, or\n(c) you don\u2019t have a Paid Account and haven't accessed our Services for 12 consecutive months.\nWe\u2019ll provide you with reasonable advance notice via the email address associated with your account to remedy the activity that prompted us to contact you and give you the opportunity to export Your Stuff from our Services. If after such notice you fail to take the steps we ask of you, we\u2019ll terminate or suspend your access to the Services.\nWe won\u2019t provide notice before termination where:\n(a) you\u2019re in material breach of these Terms,\n(b) doing so would cause us legal liability or compromise our ability to provide the Services to our other users, or\n(c) we're prohibited from doing so by law.\nWe may decide to discontinue the Services in response to unforeseen circumstances beyond Dropbox\u2019s control or to comply with a legal requirement. If we do so, we\u2019ll give you reasonable prior notice so that you can export Your Stuff from our systems. If we discontinue Services in this way before the end of any fixed or minimum term you have paid us for, we\u2019ll refund the portion of the fees you have pre-paid but haven't received Services for.\nWe strive to provide great Services, but there are certain things that we can't guarantee. TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, DROPBOX AND ITS AFFILIATES, SUPPLIERS AND DISTRIBUTORS MAKE NO WARRANTIES, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, ABOUT THE SERVICES. THE SERVICES ARE PROVIDED \"AS IS.\" WE ALSO DISCLAIM ANY WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT. Some places don\u2019t allow the disclaimers in this paragraph, so they may not apply to you.\nWE DON\u2019T EXCLUDE OR LIMIT OUR LIABILITY TO YOU WHERE IT WOULD BE ILLEGAL TO DO SO\u2014THIS INCLUDES ANY LIABILITY FOR DROPBOX\u2019S OR ITS AFFILIATES\u2019 FRAUD OR FRAUDULENT MISREPRESENTATION IN PROVIDING THE SERVICES. IN COUNTRIES WHERE THE FOLLOWING TYPES OF EXCLUSIONS AREN\u2019T ALLOWED, WE'RE RESPONSIBLE TO YOU ONLY FOR LOSSES AND DAMAGES THAT ARE A REASONABLY FORESEEABLE RESULT OF OUR FAILURE TO USE REASONABLE CARE AND SKILL OR OUR BREACH OF OUR CONTRACT WITH YOU. THIS PARAGRAPH DOESN\u2019T AFFECT CONSUMER RIGHTS THAT CAN'T BE WAIVED OR LIMITED BY ANY CONTRACT OR AGREEMENT.\nIN COUNTRIES WHERE EXCLUSIONS OR LIMITATIONS OF LIABILITY ARE ALLOWED, DROPBOX, ITS AFFILIATES, SUPPLIERS OR DISTRIBUTORS WON\u2019T BE LIABLE FOR:\ni. ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, PUNITIVE, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, OR\nii. ANY LOSS OF USE, DATA, BUSINESS, OR PROFITS, REGARDLESS OF LEGAL THEORY.\nTHESE EXCLUSIONS OR LIMITATIONS WILL APPLY REGARDLESS OF WHETHER OR NOT DROPBOX OR ANY OF ITS AFFILIATES HAS BEEN WARNED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\nIF YOU USE THE SERVICES FOR ANY COMMERCIAL, BUSINESS, OR RE-SALE PURPOSE, DROPBOX, ITS AFFILIATES, SUPPLIERS OR DISTRIBUTORS WILL HAVE NO LIABILITY TO YOU FOR ANY LOSS OF PROFIT, LOSS OF BUSINESS, BUSINESS INTERRUPTION, OR LOSS OF BUSINESS OPPORTUNITY. DROPBOX AND ITS AFFILIATES AREN\u2019T RESPONSIBLE FOR THE CONDUCT, WHETHER ONLINE OR OFFLINE, OF ANY USER OF THE SERVICES.\nOTHER THAN FOR THE TYPES OF LIABILITY WE CANNOT LIMIT BY LAW (AS DESCRIBED IN THIS SECTION), WE LIMIT OUR LIABILITY TO YOU TO THE GREATER OF $20 USD OR 100% OF ANY AMOUNT YOU'VE PAID UNDER YOUR CURRENT SERVICE PLAN WITH DROPBOX.\nLet\u2019s Try To Sort Things Out First. We want to address your concerns without needing a formal legal case. Before filing a claim against Dropbox, you agree to try to resolve the dispute informally by contacting dispute-notice@dropbox.com. We\u2019ll try to resolve the dispute informally by contacting you via email. If a dispute is not resolved within 15 days of submission, you or Dropbox may bring a formal proceeding.\nJudicial forum for disputes. You and Dropbox agree that any judicial proceeding to resolve claims relating to these Terms or the Services will be brought in the federal or state courts of San Francisco County, California, subject to the mandatory arbitration provisions below. Both you and Dropbox consent to venue and personal jurisdiction in such courts. If you reside in a country (for example, European Union member states) with laws that give consumers the right to bring disputes in their local courts, this paragraph doesn\u2019t affect those requirements.\nIF YOU\u2019RE A U.S. RESIDENT, YOU ALSO AGREE TO THE FOLLOWING MANDATORY ARBITRATION PROVISIONS:\nWe Both Agree To Arbitrate. You and Dropbox agree to resolve any claims relating to these Terms or the Services through final and binding arbitration by a single arbitrator, except as set forth under Exceptions to Agreement to Arbitrate below. This includes disputes arising out of or relating to interpretation or application of this \u201cMandatory Arbitration Provisions\u201d section, including its enforceability, revocability, or validity.\nOpt-out of Agreement to Arbitrate. You can decline this agreement to arbitrate by clicking here and submitting the opt-out form within 30 days of first registering your account. However, if you agreed to a previous version of these Terms that allowed you to opt out of arbitration, your previous choice to opt out or not opt out remains binding.\nArbitration Procedures. The American Arbitration Association (AAA) will administer the arbitration under its Commercial Arbitration Rules and the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes. The arbitration will be held in the United States county where you live or work, San Francisco (CA), or any other location we agree to.\nArbitration Fees and Incentives. The AAA rules will govern payment of all arbitration fees. Dropbox will pay all arbitration fees for individual arbitration for claims less than $75,000. If you receive an arbitration award that is more favorable than any offer we make to resolve the claim, we will pay you $1,000 in addition to the award. Dropbox will not seek its attorneys' fees and costs in arbitration unless the arbitrator determines that your claim is frivolous.\nExceptions to Agreement to Arbitrate. Either you or Dropbox may assert claims, if they qualify, in small claims court in San Francisco (CA) or any United States county where you live or work. Either party may bring a lawsuit solely for injunctive relief to stop unauthorized use or abuse of the Services, or intellectual property infringement (for example, trademark, trade secret, copyright, or patent rights) without first engaging in arbitration or the informal dispute-resolution process described above. If the agreement to arbitrate is found not to apply to you or your claim, you agree to the exclusive jurisdiction of the state and federal courts in San Francisco County, California to resolve your claim.\nNO CLASS ACTIONS. You may only resolve disputes with us on an individual basis, and may not bring a claim as a plaintiff or a class member in a class, consolidated, or representative action. Class arbitrations, class actions, private attorney general actions, and consolidation with other arbitrations aren\u2019t allowed. If this specific paragraph is held unenforceable, then the entirety of this \u201cMandatory Arbitration Provisions\u201d section will be deemed void.\nThese Terms will be governed by California law except for its conflicts of laws principles. However, some countries (including those in the European Union) have laws that require agreements to be governed by the local laws of the consumer's country. This paragraph doesn\u2019t override those laws.\nThese Terms constitute the entire agreement between you and Dropbox with respect to the subject matter of these Terms, and supersede and replace any other prior or contemporaneous agreements, or terms and conditions applicable to the subject matter of these Terms. These Terms create no third party beneficiary rights.\nDropbox\u2019s failure to enforce a provision is not a waiver of its right to do so later. If a provision is found unenforceable, the remaining provisions of the Terms will remain in full effect and an enforceable term will be substituted reflecting our intent as closely as possible. You may not assign any of your rights under these Terms, and any such attempt will be void. Dropbox may assign its rights to any of its affiliates or subsidiaries, or to any successor in interest of any business associated with the Services.\nWe may revise these Terms from time to time to better reflect:\n(a) changes to the law,\n(b) new regulatory requirements, or\n(c) improvements or enhancements made to our Services.\nIf an update affects your use of the Services or your legal rights as a user of our Services, we\u2019ll notify you prior to the update's effective date by sending an email to the email address associated with your account or via an in-product notification. These updated terms will be effective no less than 30 days from when we notify you.\nIf you don\u2019t agree to the updates we make, please cancel your account before they become effective. Where applicable, we\u2019ll offer you a prorated refund based on the amounts you have prepaid for Services and your account cancellation date. By continuing to use or access the Services after the updates come into effect, you agree to be bound by the revised Terms.\nIf your organization signed a Dropbox Business or Dropbox Enterprise Agreement with Dropbox, that Agreement may have modified the privacy policy below. Please contact your organization\u2019s Admin for details. \nPosted: April 17, 2018\nEffective: May 25, 2018\nThanks for using Dropbox!  Our mission is to create a more enlightened way of working by providing an intuitive, unified platform to collaborate with others and unleash your creative energy.  Here we describe how we collect, use, and handle your personal information when you use our websites, software, and services (\u201cServices\u201d).   For more information and details, please see our Frequently Asked Questions page.\nWe collect and use the following information to provide, improve, and protect our Services:\nAccount information.  We collect, and associate with your account, the information you provide to us when you do things such as sign up for your account, upgrade to a paid plan, and set up two-factor authentication (like your name, email address, phone number, payment info, and physical address).  Some of our Services let you access your accounts and your information via other service providers.\nYour Stuff.  Our Services are designed to make it simple for you to store your files, documents, photos, comments, messages, and so on (\u201cYour Stuff\u201d), collaborate with others, and work across multiple devices.  To make that possible, we store, process, and transmit Your Stuff as well as information related to it.  This related information includes your\u00a0profile information\u00a0that makes it easier to collaborate and share Your Stuff with others, as well as things like the size of the file, the time it was uploaded, collaborators, and usage activity.  Our Services provide you with different options for sharing Your Stuff.\nContacts.  You may choose to give us access to your contacts to make it easy for you to do things like share and collaborate on Your Stuff, send messages, and invite others to use the Services.  If you do, we\u2019ll store those contacts on our servers for you to use.\nUsage information. We collect information related to how you use the Services, including actions you take in your account (like sharing, editing, viewing, and moving files or folders).  We use this information to improve our Services, develop new services and features, and protect Dropbox users. Please refer to our FAQ for more information about how we use this usage information to improve our Services.\nDevice information.  We also collect information from and about the devices you use to access the Services.  This includes things like IP addresses, the type of browser and device you use, the web page you visited before coming to our sites, and identifiers associated with your devices.  Your devices (depending on their settings) may also transmit location information to the Services.\nCookies and other technologies. We use technologies like\u00a0cookies and pixel tags\u00a0to provide, improve, protect, and promote our Services.  For example, cookies help us with things like remembering your username for your next visit, understanding how you are interacting with our Services, and improving them based on that information.  You can set your browser to not accept cookies, but this may limit your ability to use the Services.  If our systems receive a DNT:1 signal from your browser, we\u2019ll respond to that signal as outlined\u00a0here.\nMarketing. We give users the option to use some of our Services free of charge.  These free Services are made possible by the fact that some users upgrade to one of our paid Services.  If you register for our free Services, we will, from time to time, send you information about upgrades when permissible.  Users who receive these marketing materials can opt out at any time.  If you do not want to receive marketing materials from us, simply click the \u2018unsubscribe\u2019 link in any email, or update your preferences in the Notifications section of your personal account.\nWe sometimes contact people who do not have a Dropbox account.  For recipients in the EU, we or a third party will obtain consent before contacting you.  If you receive an email and no longer wish to be contacted by Dropbox, you can unsubscribe and remove yourself from our contact list via the message itself.\nBases for processing your data.  We collect and use the personal data described above in order to provide you with the Services in a reliable and secure manner.  We also collect and use personal data for our legitimate business needs. To the extent we process your personal data for other purposes, we ask for your consent in advance or require that our partners obtain such consent.  For more information on the lawful bases for processing your data, please see our FAQ.\nWe may share information as discussed below, but we won\u2019t sell it to advertisers or other third parties.\nOthers working for and with Dropbox.  Dropbox uses certain trusted third parties (for example, providers of customer support and IT services) to help us provide, improve, protect, and promote our Services.  These third parties will access your information only to perform tasks on our behalf in compliance with this Privacy Policy, and we\u2019ll remain responsible for their handling of your information per our instructions. For a list of trusted third parties that we use to process your personal information, please see our FAQ.\nOther users.  Our Services display information like your name, profile picture, device, and email address to other users in places like your user profile and sharing notifications.  You can also share Your Stuff with other users if you choose.  When you register your Dropbox account with an email address on a domain owned by your employer or organization, we may help collaborators and administrators find you and your team by making some of your basic information\u2014like your name, team name, profile picture, and email address\u2014visible to other users on the same domain.  This helps you sync up with teams you can join and helps other users share files and folders with you.\nCertain features let you make additional information available to others.\nOther applications.  You can also give third-party providers access to your information and account\u2014for example, via\u00a0Dropbox APIs.  Just remember that their use of your information will be governed by their privacy policies and terms.\nDropbox Team Admins.\u00a0 If you are a user of a Dropbox team (e.g., Dropbox Business plans or Dropbox Education), your administrator may have the ability to access and control your Dropbox team account.  Please refer to your organization\u2019s internal policies if you have questions about this.  If you are not a Dropbox team user but interact with a Dropbox team user (by, for example, joining a shared folder or accessing stuff shared by that user), members of that organization may be able to view the name, email address, profile picture, and IP address that was associated with your account at the time of that interaction.\nLaw & Order and the Public Interest. We may disclose your information to third parties if we determine that such disclosure is reasonably necessary to: (a) comply with any applicable law, regulation, legal process, or appropriate government request; (b) protect any person from death or serious bodily injury; (c) prevent fraud or abuse of Dropbox or our users; (d) protect Dropbox\u2019s rights, property, safety, or interest; or (e) perform a task carried out in the public interest.\nStewardship of your data is critical to us and a responsibility that we embrace.  We believe that your data should receive the same legal protections regardless of whether it\u2019s stored on our Services or on your home computer\u2019s hard drive.  We\u2019ll abide by the following\u00a0Government Request Principles\u00a0when receiving, scrutinizing, and responding to government requests (including national security requests) for your data:\n---Be transparent,\n---Fight blanket requests,\n---Protect all users, and\n---Provide trusted services.\nWe publish a\u00a0Transparency Report\u00a0as part of our commitment to informing you about when and how governments ask us for information.  This report details the types and numbers of requests we receive from law enforcement.  We encourage you to review our\u00a0Government Request Principles\u00a0and\u00a0Transparency Report\u00a0for more detailed information on our approach and response to government requests.\nSecurity.  We have a team dedicated to keeping your information secure and testing for vulnerabilities.  We also continue to work on features to keep your information safe in addition to things like two-factor authentication, encryption of files at rest, and alerts when new devices and apps are linked to your account. We deploy automated technologies to detect abusive behavior and content that may harm our Services, you, or other users.\nUser Controls.  You can access, amend, download, and delete your personal information by logging into your Dropbox account and going to your account settings page.  You can also limit the way we collect and use your data on the user control page of your Dropbox account.  Learn more\u00a0here about managing your account information generally, or click here to learn how to change your profile information.\nRetention.  When you sign up for an account with us, we\u2019ll retain information you store on our Services for as long as your account is in existence or as long as we need it to provide you the Services.  If you delete your account, we will initiate deletion of this information after 30 days.  Learn more here.  But please note: (1) there might be some latency in deleting this information from our servers and back-up storage; and (2) we may retain this information if necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, or enforce our agreements.\nAround the world.  To provide you with the Services, we may store, process, and transmit information in the United States and locations around the world\u2014including those outside your country.  Information may also be stored locally on the devices you use to access the Services.\nEU-U.S. Privacy Shield and Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield.\u00a0 When transferring data from the European Union, the European Economic Area, and Switzerland, Dropbox relies upon a variety of legal mechanisms, including contracts with our customers and affiliates.  Dropbox complies with the EU-U.S. and Swiss\u2013U.S. Privacy Shield Frameworks as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal information transferred from the European Union, the European Economic Area, and Switzerland to the United States.  You can find Dropbox\u2019s Privacy Shield certification\u00a0here.  You can also learn more about Privacy Shield at\u00a0https://www.privacyshield.gov.\nDropbox is subject to oversight by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission.  JAMS is the US-based independent organization responsible for reviewing and resolving complaints about our Privacy Shield compliance\u2014free of charge to you.  We ask that you first submit any such complaints directly to us via privacy@dropbox.com.  If you aren\u2019t satisfied with our response, please contact JAMS at\u00a0https://www.jamsadr.com/eu-us-privacy-shield.  In the event your concern still isn\u2019t addressed by JAMS, you may be entitled to a binding arbitration under Privacy Shield and its principles.\nIf we are involved in a reorganization, merger, acquisition, or sale of our assets, your information may be transferred as part of that deal.  We will notify you (for example, via a message to the email address associated with your account) of any such deal and outline your choices in that event.\nWe may revise this Privacy Policy from time to time, and will post the most current version on our website.  If a revision meaningfully reduces your rights, we will notify you.\nYou have control over your personal information and how it is collected, used, and shared.  For example, you have a right to:\n---Erase or delete all or some of Your Stuff in your Dropbox account.  You can learn more about how to delete files saved on Dropbox here.\n---Change or correct personal data.  You can manage your account and the content contained in it, as well as edit some of your personal data, through your account settings page.\n---Access and take your data.  You can download a copy of Your Stuff in a machine readable format as outlined here. You can also ask us for a copy of personal data you provided to us.  Find out how here.\nFor more information on your right to control and access your personal information, please see our FAQ.\nIf you reside in North America (the United States, Canada, and Mexico), your personal information is controlled by Dropbox, Inc.  For all other users, your personal information is controlled by Dropbox International Unlimited Company.  Have questions or concerns about Dropbox, our Services, and privacy?  Contact our Data Protection Officer at\u00a0privacy@dropbox.com.  If they can\u2019t answer your question, you have the right to contact your local data protection supervisory authority.\nThis section of the agreement only applies to Dropbox Business customers. If your organization signed a Dropbox Business or Dropbox Enterprise Agreement with Dropbox, that Agreement may be different from the terms below. Please contact your organization\u2019s Admin for details. \n        Posted: 17 April 2018\n    \n        This Dropbox Business Agreement (the \"Agreement\") is between Dropbox International Unlimited Company if your organization is based outside the United States, its territories and possessions, Canada and Mexico\n        (\"North America\") or, if your organization is based in North America, with Dropbox, Inc., a Delaware corporation (each, \"Dropbox\") and the organization agreeing to these terms (\"Customer\"). This Agreement governs access to and use of the Services and Beta Services. By clicking \"I agree,\" signing your contract for the Services, or using the Services, you agree to this Agreement as a Customer.\n    \n        To the extent that Dropbox, Inc. is, on behalf of the Customer, Processing Customer Data that is subject to EU Data Protection Laws, by clicking \"I agree\", you are also agreeing to the Data Processing Agreement and EU Standard Contractual Clauses, defined below, with Dropbox, Inc. for the transfer of Personal Data to processors.\n    \n        If you are agreeing to this Agreement and, if applicable, the Data Processing Agreement, for use of the Services by an organization, you are agreeing on behalf of that organization. You must have the authority to bind that organization to these terms, otherwise you must not sign up for the Services.\n    \n---\nServices.\n            \nProvision. This Agreement governs access to, and use of, the Services and Software. Customer and End Users may access and use the Services in accordance with this Agreement.\n                \nSecurity Measures. Any Dropbox personnel who have access to Customer Data will be\n                    bound by appropriate confidentiality obligations. Dropbox will use industry standard\n                    technical and organizational security measures to transfer, store, and Process Customer Data that, at a minimum, will comply with the Security Measures. The Security Measures are designed to protect the integrity of Customer Data and guard against the unauthorized or unlawful access to, use, and Processing of Customer Data. Dropbox may\n                    update the Security Measures from time to time. Dropbox will provide Customer with at least sixty\n                    days prior notice if Dropbox updates the Security Measures in a manner that materially diminishes\n                    the administrative, technical, or physical security features of the Services taken as a whole.\n                \nData Processing and Transfer.\n                    \nData Processing. This Agreement constitutes Customer\u2019s instructions to Dropbox to Process Customer Data. Dropbox and its Sub-processors will only Process Customer Data to provide the Services and to fulfill Dropbox's obligations in this Agreement. Customer agrees that Dropbox and its Sub-processors may transfer, store, and Process Customer Data in locations other than Customer's country. Dropbox will inform Customer of any legal requirement which prevents it from complying with Customer\u2019s instructions, unless prohibited from doing so by applicable law or on important grounds of public interest. The parties acknowledge that Customer Data may contain Personal Data, and a description of the Personal Data and further information about\n                            the Processing is set out in the Data Processing Agreement.\n                        \nEU-U.S. and Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield Programs. Dropbox is certified and complies with the EU-U.S. and Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield Programs. If the Privacy Shield Programs are invalidated, Dropbox will use commercially reasonable efforts to comply with alternate or successor data transfer mechanisms.\n                        \nData Processing Agreement. To the extent Customer Data is subject to EU Data Protection Laws and is processed by Dropbox on Customer's behalf: (i) Dropbox will use and process Customer Data as Customer instructs in order to provide the Services and to fulfilll Dropbox's obligations under the Agreement; and (ii) Customer agrees to the Data Processing Agreement with Dropbox, Inc. for the transfer of Personal Data. The Data Processing Agreement applies only to the Services, and does not apply to Beta Services.\n                        \nModifications. Dropbox may update the Services from time to time. If Dropbox changes the Services in a manner that materially reduces their functionality, Dropbox will notify Customer at the email address associated with the account, and Customer may provide notice within thirty days of the change to terminate the Agreement. This termination right will not apply to updates made to features provided on a beta or evaluation basis.\n                \nSoftware.\n                    \nGenerally. The Services allow Customer and End Users to download Software that may update automatically. If any component of the Software is offered under an open source license, Dropbox will make the license available to Customer and to the extent the provisions of that license grant Customer additional rights, those provisions will expressly override some terms of this Agreement with respect to that component of the Software.\n                        \nLicense. Dropbox hereby grants to Customer during the Term a limited non-exclusive license to use the Software solely in connection with the Services and in accordance with this Agreement. This license is non-transferable (subject to Section 12.8), irrevocable (except as set forth in Section 7), non-sublicensable, and will be fully paid up upon Customer's payment of the Fees.\n                        \nCustomer Domains. Prior to providing the Services Dropbox may require Customer to verify that Customer owns or controls the Customer Domains. If Customer does not own or control the Customer Domains, then Dropbox will have no obligation to provide Customer with the Services.\n                \n---\nCustomer Obligations.\n            \nCustomer Administration of the Services. Customer may specify End Users as Administrators through the Admin Console. Customer is responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of passwords and Admin Accounts, and managing access to Admin Accounts. Dropbox's responsibilities do not extend to the internal management or administration of the Services for Customer. The Customer acknowledges that, if the Customer purchases the Services through a reseller and designates any of the reseller's personnel as Administrators of the Customer's Services account, the reseller may be able to control account information, including Customer Data, and access the Customer's Services account as described above.\n                \nUnauthorized Use or Access. Customer will prevent unauthorized use of the Services by its End Users and terminate any unauthorized use of or access to the Services. End User Accounts may only be provisioned, registered, and used by a single End User. The Services are not intended for End Users under the age of 13. Customer will ensure that it does not allow any person under 13 to use the Services. Customer will promptly notify Dropbox of any unauthorized use of or access to the Services.\n                \nRestrictions. Customer will not: (a) sell, resell, or lease the Services or Software; (b) use the Services or Software for activities where use or failure of the Services or Software could lead to physical damage, death, or personal injury; (c) reverse engineer the Services or Software, or attempt or assist anyone else to do so, unless this restriction is prohibited by law; (d) use the Services or Software, including the export or re-export of Customer Data, in violation of Export Control Laws; or (e) establish a Dropbox Business account as an individual for personal, family, or household purposes.\n                \nCompliance. Customer and its End Users must use the Services in compliance with the Acceptable Use Policy. Customer is responsible for use of the Services by its End Users. Customer will comply with laws and regulations applicable to Customer's use of the Services. Customer will not take any action that would cause Dropbox to violate EU Data Protection Laws, the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977, as amended, the U.K. Bribery Act of 2010, or any other applicable anti-bribery, anti-corruption, or anti-money laundering law. Customer must satisfy itself that: (i) the Services are appropriate for its purposes, taking into account the nature of the Customer Data; and (ii) the technical and organizational requirements applicable to Dropbox under EU Data Protection Laws are satisfied by the Security Measures and this Agreement. Customer will obtain and maintain from End Users any consents necessary to allow Administrators to engage in the activities described in this Agreement and to allow Dropbox to provide the Services. Customer will not store, transmit or otherwise process any information via the Services that falls within the definition of \"Protected Health Information\" under the HIPAA Privacy Rule (45 C.F.R. Section 164.051), unless Customer and Dropbox separately enter into a HIPAA Business Associate Agreement, which may be done via the Admin Console.\n                \nThird-Party Apps and Integrations. If Customer uses any third-party service or applications, such as a service that uses a Dropbox API, with the Services: (a) Dropbox will not be responsible for any act or omission of the third-party, including the third-party's access to or use of Customer Data; and (b) Dropbox does not warrant or support any service provided by the third-party. Customer will comply with any API limits associated with the Services plan purchased by Customer.\n                \nThird-Party Requests.\n                    \nCustomer Responsibility. Customer is responsible for responding to Third-Party Requests via its own access to information. Customer will seek to obtain information required to respond to Third-Party Requests and will contact Dropbox only if it cannot comply with the Third-Party Request despite diligent efforts.\n                        \nDropbox Responsibility. Dropbox will make commercially reasonable efforts, to the extent allowed by law and by the terms of the Third-Party Request, to: (i) promptly notify Customer of Dropbox's receipt of a Third-Party Request; (ii) comply with Customer's commercially reasonable requests regarding its efforts to oppose a Third-Party Request; and (iii) provide Customer with information or tools required for Customer to respond to the Third-Party Request, if Customer is otherwise unable to respond to the Third-Party Request. If Customer fails to promptly respond to any Third-Party Request, then Dropbox may, but will not be obligated to do so.\n                        \n---\nPayment.\n            \nFees. Customer will pay Dropbox or Customer's reseller all applicable Fees for the Services, in the currency and pursuant to the payment terms indicated on the Order Form, or in the applicable agreement between Customer and Customer\u2019s reseller. Customer authorizes Dropbox, or Customer's reseller, to charge Customer for all applicable Fees using Customer's selected payment method, and Customer will issue the required purchasing documentation. Fees are non-refundable except as required by law or as otherwise specifically permitted in this Agreement.\n                \nPayment. Customer will pay Dropbox invoices on the payment interval set forth in the Order Form. Dropbox may suspend or terminate the Services if Fees are past due. Customer will provide complete and accurate billing and contact information to Dropbox or to Customer's reseller.\n                \nTaxes. Fees are exclusive of taxes and Customer is responsible for all Taxes. Dropbox, or Customer's reseller, will charge Taxes when required to do so. If Customer provides Dropbox or its reseller with a valid exemption certificate, Dropbox or the reseller will not collect the taxes covered by that certificate.\n                \nWithholding Taxes. Customer will pay Dropbox or its reseller net of any applicable Withholding Taxes. Customer and Dropbox, or Customer's reseller as applicable, will work together to avoid any Withholding Tax if exemptions, or a reduced treaty withholding rate, are available. If Dropbox or Customer's reseller qualifies for a tax exemption, or a reduced treaty withholding rate, Dropbox or Customer's reseller will provide Customer with reasonable documentary proof. Customer will provide Dropbox or Customer's reseller reasonable evidence that it has paid the relevant authority for the sum withheld or deducted.\n                \nAuto-renewals and Trials. IF THE CUSTOMER'S ACCOUNT IS SET TO AUTO-RENEWAL OR IS IN A TRIAL PERIOD AND THE CUSTOMER HAS ALREADY PROVIDED A METHOD OF PAYMENT TO DROPBOX FOR THE SERVICES, DROPBOX (OR THE CUSTOMER'S RESELLER) MAY CHARGE AUTOMATICALLY AT THE END OF THE TRIAL OR FOR THE RENEWAL, UNLESS THE CUSTOMER NOTIFIES DROPBOX (OR THE CUSTOMER'S RESELLER, AS APPLICABLE) THAT THE CUSTOMER WANTS TO CANCEL OR DISABLE AUTO-RENEWAL. Dropbox may revise Services rates by providing the Customer at least thirty days' notice prior to the next charge.\n                \nPurchase Orders. If Customer requires the use of a purchase order or purchase order number, Customer: (i) must provide the purchase order number at the time of purchase; and (ii) agrees that any terms and conditions on a Customer purchase order will not apply to this Agreement and are null and void. If the Customer is purchasing via a reseller, any terms and conditions from the Customer's reseller or in a purchase order between the Customer and its reseller that conflict with the Agreement are null and void.\n                \n---\nSuspension.\n            \nOf End User Accounts by Dropbox. If an End User: (a) violates this Agreement; or (b) uses the Services in a manner that Dropbox reasonably believes will cause it liability, then Dropbox may request that Customer suspend or terminate the applicable End User account. If Customer fails to promptly suspend or terminate the End User account, then Dropbox may do so.\n                \nSecurity Emergencies. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement, if there is a Security Emergency then Dropbox may automatically suspend use of the Services. Dropbox will make commercially reasonable efforts to narrowly tailor the suspension as needed to prevent or terminate the Security Emergency.\n                \n---\nIntellectual Property Rights.\n            \nReservation of Rights. Except as expressly set forth herein, this Agreement does not grant: (a) Dropbox any Intellectual Property Rights in Customer Data; or (b) Customer any Intellectual Property Rights in the Services or Dropbox trademarks and brand features.\n                \nLimited Permission. Customer grants Dropbox only the limited rights that are reasonably necessary for Dropbox to provide the Services. This limited permission also extends to Subcontractors or Sub-processors.\n                \nSuggestions. Dropbox may use, modify, and incorporate into its products and services, license and sublicense, any feedback, comments, or suggestions on the Services that Customer or End Users may send Dropbox or post in Dropbox's forums without any obligation to Customer.\n                \n---\nTerm.\n            \nAgreement Term. This Agreement will remain in effect for the Term.\n                \nServices Term. Dropbox will provide the Services to Customer for the Services Term. Unless the parties agree otherwise in writing, End User Accounts purchased during any Services Term will have a prorated term ending on the last day of the pre-existing Services Term.\n                \nAutomatic Renewals. Unless otherwise specified on the Order Form, following the Initial\n                    Services Term or a Renewal Term, the subscription to the Services will automatically renew for a Renewal Term, unless either party gives the other written notice of termination at least thirty days prior to the expiration of the then-current Services term. If Customer has provided a payment method to Dropbox for recurring charges as provided in Section 3.5, Customer may elect to terminate the Agreement via the Admin Console prior to the day a Renewal Term begins.\n                \n---\nTermination.\n            \nGenerally. Either Party may terminate this Agreement, including all Order Forms, if: (i) the other Party is in material breach of the Agreement and fails to cure that breach within thirty days after receipt of written notice; or (ii) the other Party ceases its business operations or becomes subject to insolvency proceedings and the proceedings are not dismissed within ninety days. Dropbox may terminate this Agreement and suspend Customer\u2019s access to the Services if required to do so by law or for an egregious violation by Customer of the Acceptable Use Policy.\n                \nEffects of Termination. If this Agreement terminates: (a) except as set forth in this Section, the rights and licenses granted by Dropbox to Customer will cease immediately; (b) Customer may, prior to termination, request reasonable additional time to export its Stored Data, provided that Dropbox may charge Customer for such extended access based on Dropbox's then-current standard fees; and (c) Dropbox will delete any End User Accounts and Stored Data relating to Customer\u2019s account in a commercially reasonable period of time following receipt of an Administrator\u2019s request to do so.  Dropbox may make instructions available to Customer regarding how to submit the Administrator request described in clause (c) of the previous sentence. The following sections will survive expiration or termination of this Agreement: 2.6 (Third-Party Requests), 3 (Payment), 5 (Intellectual Property Rights), 7.2 (Effects of Termination), 8 (Indemnification), 9 (Disclaimers), 10 (Limitation of Liability), 11 (Disputes), and 12 (Miscellaneous). Notwithstanding the foregoing, Section 2.6 (Third-Party Requests) shall not survive termination if Dropbox has exercised a right to terminate the Agreement.\n                \n---\nIndemnification.\n            \nBy Customer. Customer will indemnify, defend, and hold harmless Dropbox from and against all liabilities, damages, and costs (including settlement costs and reasonable attorneys' fees) arising out of any Claim against Dropbox and its Affiliates regarding: (a) Customer Data; (b) Customer Domains; or (c) Customer's, or Customer's End Users', use of the Services in violation of this Agreement.\n                \nBy Dropbox. Dropbox will indemnify, defend, and hold harmless Customer from and against all liabilities, damages, and costs (including settlement costs and reasonable attorneys' fees) arising out of any Claim against Customer to the extent based on an allegation that Dropbox's technology used to provide the Services to the Customer infringes or misappropriates any copyright, trade secret, U.S. patent, or trademark right of the third party. In no event will Dropbox have any obligations or liability under this section arising from: (a) use of any Services in a modified form or in combination with materials not furnished by Dropbox; and (b) any content, information, or data provided by Customer, End Users, or other third parties.\n                \nPossible Infringement. If Dropbox believes the Services or Software infringe or may be alleged to infringe a third party's Intellectual Property Rights, then Dropbox may: (a) obtain the right for Customer, at Dropbox's expense, to continue using the Services or Software; (b) provide a non-infringing functionally equivalent replacement; or (c) modify the Services or Software so that they no longer infringe. If Dropbox does not believe the options described in this section are commercially reasonable, then Dropbox may suspend or terminate Customer's use of the affected Services or Software, with a pro-rata refund of prepaid fees for the Services or Software.\n                \nGeneral. The Party seeking indemnification will promptly notify the other Party of the claim and cooperate with the other Party in defending the claim. The indemnifying Party will have full control and authority over the defense, except that: (a) any settlement requiring the Party seeking indemnification to admit liability requires prior written consent, not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed; and (b) the other Party may join in the defense with its own counsel at its own expense. THE INDEMNITIES ABOVE ARE DROPBOX AND CUSTOMER'S ONLY REMEDY UNDER THIS AGREEMENT FOR VIOLATION BY THE OTHER PARTY OF A THIRD PARTY'S INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS.\n                \n---\nDisclaimers.\n            \nGenerally. THE SERVICES AND SOFTWARE ARE PROVIDED \"AS IS.\" TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY STATED IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER CUSTOMER NOR DROPBOX AND ITS AFFILIATES, SUPPLIERS, AND DISTRIBUTORS MAKE ANY WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, WHETHER EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR USE, OR NON-INFRINGEMENT.

TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, DROPBOX'S AGGREGATE LIABILITY UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT EXCEED THE LESSER OF $100,000 OR THE AMOUNT PAID BY CUSTOMER TO DROPBOX HEREUNDER DURING THE TWELVE MONTHS PRIOR TO THE EVENT GIVING RISE TO LIABILITY.\n                \n---\nDisputes.\n            \nInformal Resolution. Before filing a claim, each Party agrees to try to resolve the dispute by contacting the other Party through the notice procedures in Section 12.6. If a dispute is not resolved within thirty days of notice, Customer or Dropbox may bring a formal proceeding.\n                \nArbitration. Customer and Dropbox agree to resolve any claims relating to this Agreement or the Services through final and binding arbitration, except as set forth below. The American Arbitration Association (AAA) will administer the arbitration under its Commercial Arbitration Rules. The arbitration will be held in San Francisco (CA), or any other location both parties agree to in writing.\n                \nException to Arbitration. Either Party may bring a lawsuit in the federal or state courts of San Francisco County, California solely for injunctive relief to stop unauthorized use or abuse of the Services or infringement of Intellectual Property Rights without first engaging in the informal dispute notice process described above. Both Customer and Dropbox consent to venue and personal jurisdiction there.\n                \nNO CLASS ACTIONS. Customer may only resolve disputes with Dropbox on an individual basis and will not bring a claim in a class, consolidated or representative action.

Dropbox may revise this Agreement from time to time and the most current version will always be posted on the Dropbox Business website. If a revision, in Dropbox's sole discretion, is material, Dropbox will notify Customer (by, for example, sending an email to the email address associated with the applicable account). Other revisions may be posted to Dropbox's blog or terms page, and Customer is responsible for checking these postings regularly. By continuing to access or use the Services after revisions become effective, Customer agrees to be bound by the revised Agreement. If Customer does not agree to the revised Agreement terms, Customer may terminate the Services within thirty days of receiving notice of the change.\n                \nEntire Agreement. This Agreement supersedes any prior agreements or understandings between the Parties, and constitutes the entire Agreement between the Parties related to this subject matter. All attachments to the Agreement, the Data Processing Agreement, Customer invoices, and Order Forms executed by the Parties, are hereby incorporated into the Agreement by this reference.\n                \nInterpretation of Conflicting Terms. If there is a conflict between the documents that make up this Agreement, the documents will control in the following order: the invoice, the Order Form, the Agreement. The terms and conditions of this Agreement will be considered the confidential information of Dropbox, and Customer will not disclose the information to any third parties. Customer agrees that any terms and conditions on a Customer purchase order will not apply to this Agreement and are null and void. If End Users are required to click through terms of service in order to use the Services, those click through terms are subordinate to this Agreement and this Agreement will control if there is a conflict.\n                \nGoverning Law. THE AGREEMENT WILL BE GOVERNED BY CALIFORNIA LAW EXCEPT FOR ITS CONFLICTS OF LAWS PRINCIPLES.\n                \nSeverability.

Box 77767, San Francisco, CA 94107, attn.: Legal Department.\n                \nWaiver. A waiver of any default is not a waiver of any subsequent default.\n                \nAssignment. Customer may not assign or transfer this Agreement or any rights or obligations under this Agreement without the written consent of Dropbox. Dropbox may not assign this Agreement without providing notice to Customer, except Dropbox may assign this Agreement or any rights or obligations under this Agreement to an Affiliate or in connection with a merger, acquisition, corporate reorganization, or sale of all or substantially all of its assets without providing notice. Any other attempt to transfer or assign is void.\n                \nNo Agency.

That is our privacy policy in a nutshell. The rest of this page tries to explain why you should care.\n---Why You Should Care - Search Leakage\n---Why You Should Care - Search History\n---Information Not Collected\n---Information Collected\n---Information Shared\n---Last updated on 04/11/12.

This paragraph was added.\nAt other search engines, when you do a search and then click on a link, your search terms are sent to that site you clicked on (in the HTTP referrer header). We call this sharing of personal information \"search leakage.\"\nFor example, when you search for something private, you are sharing that private search not only with your search engine, but also with all the sites that you clicked on (for that search).\nIn addition, when you visit any site, your computer automatically sends information about it to that site (including your User agent and IP address). This information can often be used to identify you directly.\nSo when you do that private search, not only can those other sites know your search terms, but they can also know that you searched it. It is this combination of available information about you that raises privacy concerns.\nDuckDuckGo prevents search leakage by default. Instead, when you click on a link on our site, we route (redirect) that request in such a way so that it does not send your search terms to other sites. The other sites will still know that you visited them, but they will not know what search you entered beforehand.\nAt some other search engines (including us), you can also use an encrypted version (HTTPS), which as a byproduct doesn't usually send your search terms to sites. However, it is slower to connect to these versions and if you click on a site that also uses HTTPS then your search is sent. Nevertheless, the encrypted version does protect your search from being leaked onto the computers it travels on between you and us.\nAt DuckDuckGo, our encrypted version goes even further and automatically changes links from a number of major Web sites to point to the encrypted versions of those sites. It is modeled after (and uses code from) the HTTPS Everywhere FireFox add-on. These sites include Wikipedia, Facebook, Twitter, and Amazon to name a few.\nAnother way to prevent search leakage is by using something called a POST request, which has the effect of not showing your search in your browser, and, as a consequence, does not send it to other sites. You can turn on POST requests on our settings page, but it has its own issues. POST requests usually break browser back buttons, and they make it impossible for you to easily share your search by copying and pasting it out of your Web browser's address bar.\nFinally, if you want to prevent sites from knowing you visited them at all, you can use a proxy like Tor. DuckDuckGo actually operates a Tor exit enclave, which means you can get end to end anonymous and encrypted searching using Tor & DDG together.\nYou can enter !proxy domain into DuckDuckGo as well, and we will route you through a proxy, e.g. !proxy breadpig.com. This feature is part of our !bang syntax. Unfortunately, proxies can also be slow, and free proxies (like the one we use) are funded by arguably excessive advertising.\nBecause of these drawbacks in HTTPS, POST and proxies we decided to take the redirect approach to combat search leakage. However, we leave the choice up to you. You can deviate from the default on our settings page by toggling the redirect or address bar settings. You can also use our encrypted version.\nOther search engines save your search history. Usually your searches are saved along with the date and time of the search, some information about your computer (e.g. your IP address, User agent and often a unique identifier stored in a browser cookie), and if you are logged in, your account information (e.g. name and email address).\nWith only the timestamp and computer information, your searches can often be traced directly to you. With the additional account information, they are associated directly with you.\nAlso, note that with this information your searches can be tied together. This means someone can see everything you've been searching, not just one isolated search. You can usually find out a lot about a person from their search history.\nIt's sort of creepy that people at search engines can see all this info about you, but that is not the main concern. The main concern is when they either a) release it to the public or b) give it to law enforcement.\nWhy would they release it to the public? AOL famously released supposedly anonymous search terms for research purposes, except they didn't do a good job of making them completely anonymous, and they were ultimately sued over it. In fact, almost every attempt to anonymize data has similarly been later found out to be much less anonymous than initially thought.\nThe other way to release it to the public is by accident. Search engines could lose data, or get hacked, or accidentally expose data due to security holes or incompetence, all of which has happened with personal information on the Internet. \nWhy would search engines give your search history to law enforcement? Simply because law enforcement asked for it, usually as part of a legal investigation. If you read privacy policies and terms of service carefully you will notice that they say they can give your information on court order. \nThis makes sense because they may be legally obligated to do so. However, search engines are not legally obligated to collect personal information in the first place. They do it on their own volition.\nThe bottom line is if search engines have your information, it could get out, even if they have the best intentions. And this information (your search history) can be pretty personal.\nFor these reasons, DuckDuckGo takes the approach to not collect any personal information. The decisions of whether and how to comply with law enforcement requests, whether and how to anonymize data, and how to best protect your information from hackers are out of our hands. Your search history is safe with us because it cannot be tied to you in any way.\nWhen you search at DuckDuckGo, we don't know who you are and there is no way to tie your searches together.\nWhen you access DuckDuckGo (or any Web site), your Web browser\nautomatically sends information about your computer, e.g.\nyour User agent and IP address.\nBecause this information could be used to link you to your\nsearches, we do not log (store) it at all. This is a very unusual practice, but we feel it is an important step to protect your privacy.\nIt is unusual for a few reasons. First, most server software auto-stores this information, so you have to go out of your way not to store it. Second, most businesses want to keep as much information as possible because they don't know when it will be useful. Third, many search engines actively use this information, for example to show you more targeted advertising.\nAnother way that your searches are often tied together at other search engines are through browser cookies, which are pieces of information that sit on your computer and get sent to the search engine on each request. What search engines often do is store a unique identifier in your browser and then associate that identifier with your searches. At DuckDuckGo, no cookies are used by default. \nIn response to efforts by the EFF and others, the major search engines have begun \"anonymizing\" their search log data after periods of time. Sure, this is better than not doing so, but you should note that this does not make your search history anonymous in the same way that it is at DuckDuckGo. \nWhat search engines generally do when they anonymize data is get rid of part of your IP address or turn it into something that doesn't look exactly like an IP address. And they do the same thing for uniquely identifying cookies.\nHowever, in many cases, this so-called anonymous data can still tie your searches together, which can be used to reconstruct who you are and what you searched for. Additionally, search engines usually are silent on what they do with the User agent, which has been shown to also have enough information to often be personally identifiable, especially if isolated to a particular search session (day).\nAt DuckDuckGo, no cookies are used by default. If you have changed any settings, then cookies are used to store those changes. However, in that case, they are not stored in a personally identifiable way. For example, the large size setting is stored as 's=l'; no unique identifier is in there. Furthermore, if you prefer not to use cookies to store settings, you can use URL parameters instead.\nAdditionally, if you use our !bang syntax/dropdown, which bangs you use are stored in a cookie so that we can list your most frequently used ones on top of the !bang dropdown box. Just like the other settings, this information is not saved on our servers at all, but resides solely on your computer. There is also a setting to turn this off, which you can also set via a URL parameter. Particular searches are of course not stored. An example cookie might look like: php=2&yelp=19&java=4.\nWe also save searches, but again, not in a personally identifiable way, as we do not store IP addresses or unique User agent strings. We use aggregate, non-personal search data to improve things like misspellings.\nSimilarly, we may add an affiliate code to some eCommerce sites (e.g. Amazon & eBay) that results in small commissions being paid back to DuckDuckGo when you make purchases at those sites. We do not use any third parties to do the code insertion, and we do not work with any sites that share personally identifiable information (e.g. name, address, etc.) via their affiliate programs. This means that no information is shared from DuckDuckGo to the sites, and the only information that is collected from this process is product information, which is not tied to any particular user and which we do not save or store on our end. It is completely analogous to the search result case from the previous paragraph--we can see anonymous product info such that we cannot tie them to any particular person (or even tie multiple purchases together). This whole affiliate process is an attempt to keep advertising to a minimal level on DuckDuckGo.\nFinally, if you give us feedback, it may be stored in our email. However, you can give anonymous feedback (by not entering your email or other personal info on the feedback form).\nIf you turn redirects off in the settings and you don't either turn POST on or use our encrypted site, then your search could leak to sites you click on. Yet as explained above, this does not happen by default.\nAlso, like anyone else, we will comply with court ordered legal requests. However, in our case, we don't expect any because there is nothing useful to give them since we don't collect any personal information.\nIf you care about search privacy, you might also want to check out these other search engines that take it seriously by default.\n---Ixquick [privacy policy]\nEach does things a bit differently in terms of privacy and very differently in terms of results.

In particular, if you offer or reference your contact information or ask a buyer for their contact information in the context of buying or selling outside of eBay, you may be liable to pay a final value fee applicable to that item, even if the item doesn't sell, given your usage of eBay Services for the introduction to a buyer.\nYou must have a payment method on file when selling through eBay Services and pay all fees and applicable taxes associated with our Services by the payment due date. If your payment method fails or your account is past due, we may collect amounts owed by charging other payment methods on file with us, retain collection agencies and legal counsel, and, for accounts over 60 days past due, request that PayPal deduct the amount owed from your PayPal account balance. In addition, you will be subject to late fees. eBay, or the collection agencies we retain, may also report information about your account to credit bureaus, and as a result, late payments, missed payments, or other defaults on your account may be reflected in your credit report.

We may offer certain programs, tools, and site experiences of particular interest to international sellers and buyers, such as estimated local currency conversion and international shipping calculation tools. Sellers and buyers are responsible for complying with all laws and regulations applicable to the international sale, purchase, and shipment of items.

This may result in PayPal restricting funds in your PayPal account.\neBay may contact you using autodialed or prerecorded calls and text messages, at any telephone number that you have provided us, to: (i) notify you regarding your account; (ii) troubleshoot problems with your account; (iii) resolve a dispute; (iv) collect a debt; (v) poll your opinions through surveys or questionnaires; or (vi) as otherwise necessary to service your account or enforce this User Agreement, our policies, applicable law, or any other agreement we may have with you. eBay may also contact you using autodialed or prerecorded calls and text messages for marketing purposes (e.g., offers and promotions), if you consent to such communications. Our collection, use, disclosure, retention, and protection of your personal information is governed by the User Privacy Notice. As described in our User Privacy Notice, eBay may collect other telephone numbers for you and may place manual non-marketing calls to any of those numbers and autodialed non-marketing calls to any landline.

You may not disclose, sell, rent, or distribute a user's information to a third party for purposes unrelated to the Services. Additionally, you may not use information for marketing purposes, via electronic or other means, unless you obtain the consent of the specific user to do so.\nSellers can create rules to automate replacements, returns, and refunds under certain circumstances. For all new sellers, in listings where returns are accepted, eBay will set a default rule that automates the return process. Sellers may remove or customize their return preferences in their account settings within My eBay. Where settings have been set to automatically accept requests for returns or replacements, an eBay-generated return shipping label will be provided to your buyer. You agree to comply with our returns policy.\nWhen an item is returned, to refund the buyer, you (as seller) authorize eBay to request that PayPal remove the refund amount (in same or other currency) from your PayPal account, place the amount on your invoice, and/or charge your payment method on file.\nThe cost of return shipping for an item that is not as described is the seller's responsibility.\nYou (as seller) authorize eBay to place the return shipping label cost on your invoice, subject to your automatic payment method on file when:\n---An eBay-generated return shipping label is used, and the seller is responsible for its cost;\n---Returns have been automated;\n---You fail to send your buyer a return shipping label and, instead, an eBay-generated shipping label is used; and/or\n---A transaction is cancelled, and to refund the buyer, you (as seller) authorize eBay to request that PayPal remove the refund amount (in same or other currency) from your PayPal account. See canceling a transaction for more details.\nOne of the ways that we may make eBay.com listings available to international buyers on eBay.com and on eBay's International Sites is through the Global Shipping Program. For eligible items located in the United States and purchased by an international buyer through the Global Shipping Program, you (as seller) will simply ship the item to a parcel processing facility located in the United States after receiving notification of payment from your buyer. Pitney Bowes Inc., a third-party global shipping provider, will oversee the processing, customs clearance, and international shipment of the item on behalf of your international buyer. To the extent a buyer has a question about your Global Shipping Program listings, eBay may respond directly to the buyer if the question pertains to the services overseen by Pitney Bowes Inc. (for example, customs or international shipping). You pay no additional fees for selling through the Global Shipping Program.\nPursuant to a routed export transaction under the U.S. Export Administration Regulations and Foreign Trade Regulations, your buyer, as the Foreign Principal Party in Interest, will agree to assume responsibility for the export shipment, with Pitney Bowes Inc. acting as your buyer's forwarding agent. You remain liable for the accuracy of information you provide about items, and you agree to provide timely responses to requests for additional information.\nYou consent to the disclosure of certain personally identifiable information, as well as listing and order information, by eBay to Pitney Bowes Inc., and by Pitney Bowes Inc. to its affiliates, service providers, and other third parties (such as customs and revenue authorities, as well as other government agencies), in connection with the processing, export and customs clearance, and international transportation of any item. eBay does not control the privacy policies of Pitney Bowes Inc., its affiliates, or its service providers, and you are subject to the privacy policies of those parties, as applicable.\nAdditional information about the program, including policies governing feedback, the handling of lost, damaged, and undeliverable items, returns, and the resolution of buyer protection claims for items that you sell through the program, can be found on our Global Shipping Program - opens in new window or tab and Global Shipping FAQs - opens in new window or tab pages.\nMost eBay sales go smoothly, but if there's a problem with a purchase, the eBay Money Back Guarantee helps buyers and sellers communicate and resolve issues. You agree to comply with the policy and permit us to make a final decision on any eBay Money Back Guarantee case.\nIf you (as seller), choose to reimburse a buyer, or are required to reimburse a buyer or eBay under the eBay Money Back Guarantee, you authorize eBay to request that PayPal remove the reimbursement amount (in same or other currency) from your PayPal account, place the amount on your invoice, and/or charge your payment method on file. If we cannot get reimbursement from you, we may collect the outstanding sums using other collection mechanisms, including retaining collection agencies.\nWe may suspend the eBay Money Back Guarantee in whole or in part without notice if we suspect abuse or interference with the proper working of the policy.\nWe try to keep our Services safe, secure, and functioning properly, but we cannot guarantee the continuous operation of or access to our Services.

Such functionality is subject to delays beyond eBay's control.\nYou agree that you are making use of our Services at your own risk, and that they are being provided to you on an \"AS IS\" and \"AS AVAILABLE\" basis. Accordingly, to the extent permitted by applicable law, we exclude all express or implied warranties, terms and conditions including, but not limited to, implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and non-infringement.\nIn addition, to the extent permitted by applicable law, we (including our parent, subsidiaries, and affiliates, and our and their officers, directors, agents and employees) are not liable, and you agree not to hold us responsible, for any damages or losses (including, but not limited to, loss of money, goodwill or reputation, profits, other intangible losses, or any special, indirect, or consequential damages) resulting directly or indirectly from:\n---the content you provide (directly or indirectly) using the Services;\n---your use of or your inability to use our Services;\n---pricing, shipping, format, or other guidance provided by eBay;\n---delays or disruptions in our Services;\n---viruses or other malicious software obtained by accessing or linking to our Services;\n---glitches, bugs, errors, or inaccuracies of any kind in our Services;\n---damage to your hardware device from the use of any eBay Service;\n---the content, actions, or inactions of third parties, including items listed using our Services or the destruction of allegedly fake items;\n---a suspension or other action taken with respect to your account or breach of the Abusing eBay Section above;\n---the duration or manner in which your listings appear in search results as set out in the Listing Conditions Section above; or\n---your need to modify practices, content, or behavior, or your loss of or inability to do business, as a result of changes to this User Agreement or our policies.\nSome jurisdictions do not allow the disclaimer of warranties or exclusion of damages, so such disclaimers and exclusions may not apply to you.\nRegardless of the previous paragraphs, if we are found to be liable, our liability to you or to any third party is limited to the greater of (a) any amounts due under the eBay Money Back Guarantee up to the price the item sold for on eBay (including any applicable sales tax) and its original shipping costs, (b) the amount of fees in dispute not to exceed the total fees, which you paid to us in the 12 months prior to the action giving rise to the liability, or (c) $100.\nIf you have a dispute with one or more users, you release us (and our affiliates and subsidiaries, and our and their respective officers, directors, employees and agents) from claims, demands and damages (actual and consequential) of every kind and nature, known and unknown, arising out of or in any way connected with such disputes.

IT AFFECTS YOUR RIGHTS AND WILL HAVE A SUBSTANTIAL IMPACT ON HOW CLAIMS YOU AND EBAY HAVE AGAINST EACH OTHER ARE RESOLVED.\nYou and eBay agree that any claim or dispute at law or equity that has arisen, or may arise, between you and eBay (including any claim or dispute between you and a third-party agent of eBay) that relates in any way to or arises out of this or previous versions of this User Agreement, your use of or access to the Services, the actions of eBay or its agents, or any products or services sold or purchased through the Services, will be resolved in accordance with the provisions set forth in this Legal Disputes Section.\nYou agree that, except to the extent inconsistent with or preempted by federal law, the laws of the State of Utah, without regard to principles of conflict of laws, will govern this User Agreement and any claim or dispute that has arisen or may arise between you and eBay, except as otherwise stated in this User Agreement.\nYou and eBay each agree that any and all disputes or claims that have arisen, or may arise, between you and eBay (including any disputes or claims between you and a third-party agent of eBay) that relate in any way to or arise out of this or previous versions of the User Agreement, your use of or access to the Services, the actions of eBay or its agents, or any products or services sold, offered, or purchased through the Services shall be resolved exclusively through final and binding arbitration, rather than in court. Alternatively, you may assert your claims in small claims court, if your claims qualify and so long as the matter remains in such court and advances only on an individual (non-class, non-representative) basis. The Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this Agreement to Arbitrate.\n---Prohibition of Class and Representative Actions and Non-Individualized Relief\nYOU AND EBAY AGREE THAT EACH OF US MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS, OR REPRESENTATIVE OR PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL ACTION OR PROCEEDING. UNLESS BOTH YOU AND EBAY AGREE OTHERWISE, THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE OR JOIN MORE THAN ONE PERSON'S OR PARTY'S CLAIMS, AND MAY NOT OTHERWISE PRESIDE OVER ANY FORM OF A CONSOLIDATED, REPRESENTATIVE, CLASS, OR PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL ACTION OR PROCEEDING. ALSO, THE ARBITRATOR MAY AWARD RELIEF (INCLUDING MONETARY, INJUNCTIVE, AND DECLARATORY RELIEF) ONLY IN FAVOR OF THE INDIVIDUAL PARTY SEEKING RELIEF AND ONLY TO THE EXTENT NECESSARY TO PROVIDE RELIEF NECESSITATED BY THAT PARTY'S INDIVIDUAL CLAIM(S). ANY RELIEF AWARDED CANNOT AFFECT OTHER USERS. If a court decides that applicable law precludes enforcement of any of this paragraph's limitations as to a particular claim for relief, then that claim (and only that claim) must be severed from the arbitration and may be brought in court, subject to your and eBay's right to appeal the court's decision. All other claims will be arbitrated.\n---Arbitration Procedures\nArbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in court. Arbitration uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, and court review of an arbitration award is very limited. However, an arbitrator can award the same damages and relief on an individual basis that a court can award to an individual. An arbitrator should apply the terms of the User Agreement as a court would. All issues are for the arbitrator to decide, except that issues relating to arbitrability, the scope or enforceability of this Agreement to Arbitrate, or the interpretation of Section 1 of this Agreement to Arbitrate (\"Prohibition of Class and Representative Actions and Non-Individualized Relief\"), shall be for a court of competent jurisdiction to decide.\nThe arbitration will be conducted by the American Arbitration Association (\"AAA\") under its rules and procedures, including the AAA's Consumer Arbitration Rules (as applicable), as modified by this Agreement to Arbitrate. The AAA's rules are available at www.adr.org or by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879. The use of the word \"arbitrator\" in this provision shall not be construed to prohibit more than one arbitrator from presiding over an arbitration; rather, the AAA's rules will govern the number of arbitrators that may preside over an arbitration conducted under this Agreement to Arbitrate.\nA party who intends to seek arbitration must first send to the other, by certified mail, a completed form Notice of Dispute (\"Notice\"). You may download a form Notice - opens in new window or tab. The Notice to eBay should be sent to eBay Inc., Attn: Litigation Department, Re: Notice of Dispute, 583 W. eBay Way, Draper, UT 84020. eBay will send any Notice to you to the physical address we have on file associated with your eBay account; it is your responsibility to keep your physical address up to date. All information called for in the Notice must be provided, including a description of the nature and basis of the claims the party is asserting and the relief sought.\nIf you and eBay are unable to resolve the claims described in the Notice within 30 days after the Notice is sent, you or eBay may initiate arbitration proceedings. A form for initiating arbitration proceedings is available on the AAA's site at www.adr.org. In addition to filing this form with the AAA in accordance with its rules and procedures, the party initiating the arbitration must mail a copy of the completed form to the opposing party. You may send a copy to eBay at the following address: eBay, Inc. c/o CT Corporation System, 1108 E South Union Ave., Midvale, UT 84047. In the event eBay initiates an arbitration against you, it will send a copy of the completed form to the physical address we have on file associated with your eBay account. Any settlement offer made by you or eBay shall not be disclosed to the arbitrator.\nThe arbitration hearing shall be held in the county in which you reside or at another mutually agreed location. If the value of the relief sought is $10,000 or less, you or eBay may elect to have the arbitration conducted by telephone or based solely on written submissions, which election shall be binding on you and eBay subject to the arbitrator's discretion to require an in-person hearing, if the circumstances warrant. In cases where an in-person hearing is held, you and/or eBay may attend by telephone, unless the arbitrator requires otherwise.\nThe arbitrator will decide the substance of all claims in accordance with applicable law, including recognized principles of equity, and will honor all claims of privilege recognized by law. The arbitrator shall not be bound by rulings in prior arbitrations involving different users, but is bound by rulings in prior arbitrations involving the same eBay user to the extent required by applicable law. The arbitrator's award shall be final and binding and judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof.\n---Costs of Arbitration\nPayment of all filing, administration and arbitrator fees will be governed by the AAA's rules, unless otherwise stated in this Agreement to Arbitrate. If the value of the relief sought is $10,000 or less, at your request, eBay will pay all filing, administration, and arbitrator fees associated with the arbitration. Any request for payment of fees by eBay should be submitted by mail to the AAA along with your Demand for Arbitration and eBay will make arrangements to pay all necessary fees directly to the AAA. If (a) you willfully fail to comply with the Notice of Dispute requirement discussed above, or (b) in the event the arbitrator determines the claim(s) you assert in the arbitration to be frivolous, you agree to reimburse eBay for all fees associated with the arbitration paid by eBay on your behalf that you otherwise would be obligated to pay under the AAA's rules.\n---Severability\nWith the exception of any of the provisions in Section 1 of this Agreement to Arbitrate (\"Prohibition of Class and Representative Actions and Non-Individualized Relief\"), if an arbitrator or court decides that any part of this Agreement to Arbitrate is invalid or unenforceable, the other parts of this Agreement to Arbitrate shall still apply.\n---Opt-Out Procedure\nIF YOU ARE A NEW USER OF OUR SERVICES, YOU CAN CHOOSE TO REJECT THIS AGREEMENT TO ARBITRATE (\"OPT-OUT\") BY MAILING US A WRITTEN OPT-OUT NOTICE (\"OPT-OUT NOTICE\"). THE OPT-OUT NOTICE MUST BE POSTMARKED NO LATER THAN 30 DAYS AFTER THE DATE YOU ACCEPT THE USER AGREEMENT FOR THE FIRST TIME.

Opting out of this Agreement to Arbitrate has no effect on any previous, other, or future arbitration agreements that you may have with us.\n---Future Amendments to the Agreement to Arbitrate\nNotwithstanding any provision in the User Agreement to the contrary, you and we agree that if we make any amendment to this Agreement to Arbitrate (other than an amendment to any notice address or site link provided herein) in the future, that amendment shall not apply to any claim that was filed in a legal proceeding against eBay prior to the effective date of the amendment. The amendment shall apply to all other disputes or claims governed by the Agreement to Arbitrate that have arisen or may arise between you and eBay.

You and eBay agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of the courts located within Salt Lake County, Utah for the purpose of litigating all such claims or disputes.\nExcept as otherwise provided in this User Agreement, if any provision of this User Agreement is held to be invalid, void or for any reason unenforceable, such provision shall be struck out and shall not affect the validity and enforceability of the remaining provisions. In our sole discretion, we may assign this User Agreement, and in such event, we will post notice on www.ebay.com - opens in new window or tab.\nHeadings are for reference purposes only and do not limit the scope or extent of such Section. Our failure to act with respect to a breach by you or others does not waive our right to act with respect to subsequent or similar breaches. We do not guarantee we will take action against all breaches of this User Agreement.\nWe may amend this User Agreement at any time by posting the amended terms on www.eBay.com. Our right to amend the User Agreement includes the right to modify, add to, or remove terms in the User Agreement. We will provide you 30 days' notice by posting the amended terms.

It also contains an Agreement to Arbitrate, which will, with limited exception, require you to submit claims you have against us or our agents to binding and final arbitration, unless you opt out of the Agreement to Arbitrate (see Legal Disputes, Section B (\"Agreement to Arbitrate\")).

The actual contract for sale is directly between the seller and buyer. eBay is not a traditional auctioneer.\nWhile we may provide pricing, shipping, listing, sourcing, and other guidance in our Services, such guidance is solely informational and you may decide to follow it or not. Also, while we may help facilitate the resolution of disputes through various programs, eBay has no control over and does not guarantee: the existence, quality, safety or legality of items advertised; the truth or accuracy of users' content or listings; the ability of sellers to sell items; the ability of buyers to pay for items; or that a buyer or seller will actually complete a transaction or return an item.\nIn connection with using or accessing the Services you will not:\n---post, list or upload content or items in inappropriate categories or areas on our sites;\n---breach or circumvent any laws, third-party rights or our systems, policies, or determinations of your account status;\n---use our Services if you are not able to form legally binding contracts (for example, if you are under 18 years old), or are temporarily or indefinitely suspended from using our sites, services, applications or tools;\n---fail to pay for items purchased by you, unless you have a valid reason as set out in an eBay policy, for example, the seller has materially changed the item's description after you bid, a clear typographical error is made, or you cannot contact the seller (see our Unpaid item policy);\n---fail to deliver items sold by you, unless you have a valid reason as set out in an eBay policy, for example, the buyer fails to comply with the posted terms in your listing or you cannot contact the buyer;\n---manipulate the price of any item or interfere with any other user's listings;\n---post false, inaccurate, misleading, deceptive, defamatory, or libelous content;\n---take any action that may undermine the feedback or ratings systems (see All about our Feedback policies);\n---transfer your eBay account (including Feedback) and user ID to another party without our consent;\n---distribute or post spam, unsolicited or bulk electronic communications, chain letters, or pyramid schemes;\n---distribute viruses or any other technologies that may harm eBay or the interests or property of users;\n---use any robot, spider, scraper, data mining tools, data gathering and extraction tools, or other automated means to access our Services for any purpose, except with the prior express permission of eBay;\n---interfere with the working of our Services, or impose an unreasonable or disproportionately large load on our infrastructure;\n---export or re-export any eBay application or tool, except in compliance with the export control laws of any relevant jurisdictions and in accordance with posted rules and restrictions;\n---infringe the copyright, trademark, patent, publicity, moral, database, and/or other intellectual property rights (collectively, \"Intellectual Property Rights\") that belong to or are licensed to eBay.

Failure to meet these standards may result in eBay charging you additional fees, and/or limiting, restricting, suspending, or downgrading your seller account.\nIf we believe you are abusing eBay and/or our Services in any way, we may, in our sole discretion and without limiting other remedies, limit, suspend, or terminate your user account(s) and access to our Services, delay or remove hosted content, remove any special status associated with your account(s), remove, not display, and/or demote listings, reduce or eliminate any discounts, and take technical and/or legal steps to prevent you from using our Services.\nIf we believe you are violating the policy on Offers to buy or sell outside of eBay, you may be subject to a range of actions, including limits on your buying and selling privileges, restrictions on listings and account features, suspension of your account, application of fees, and recovery of expenses for policy monitoring and enforcement. If you are a seller and you offer or reference your contact information or ask a buyer for their contact information in the context of buying or selling outside of eBay, you may be liable to pay a final value fee applicable to that item, even if the item does not sell.\nWe may cancel unconfirmed accounts or accounts that have been inactive for a long time or modify or discontinue our Services. Additionally, we reserve the right to refuse or terminate all or part of our Services to anyone for any reason at our discretion.\nWhen a buyer or seller issue arises, we may consider the user's performance history and the specific circumstances in applying our policies.

We may change our seller fees from time to time by posting the changes on the eBay site 14 days in advance, but with no advance notice required for temporary promotions or any changes that result in the reduction of fees.\nIf you are a seller, you are liable for transaction fees arising out of all sales made using some or all eBay Services, even if sales terms are finalized or payment is made outside of eBay. In particular, if you offer or reference your contact information or ask a buyer for their contact information in the context of buying or selling outside of eBay, you may be liable to pay a final value fee applicable to that item, even if the item doesn't sell, given your usage of eBay Services for the introduction to a buyer.\nYou must have a payment method on file when selling through eBay Services and pay all fees and applicable taxes associated with our Services by the payment due date. If your payment method fails or your account is past due, we may collect amounts owed by charging other payment methods on file with us, retain collection agencies and legal counsel, and, for accounts over 60 days past due, request that PayPal deduct the amount owed from your PayPal account balance. In addition, you will be subject to late fees. eBay, or the collection agencies we retain, may also report information about your account to credit bureaus, and as a result, late payments, missed payments, or other defaults on your account may be reflected in your credit report. If you wish to dispute the information eBay reported to a credit bureau (i.e., Experian, Equifax or TransUnion) please contact us at eBay Inc., C/O Global Collections, 7700 West Parmer Lane, Building D, Austin, TX 78729. If you wish to dispute the information a collection agency reported to a credit bureau regarding your eBay account, you must contact the collection agency directly.\nSeller fees don't purchase exclusive rights to item exposure on eBay, whether on a web page, mobile app, or otherwise.

This may result in PayPal restricting funds in your PayPal account.\neBay may contact you using autodialed or prerecorded calls and text messages, at any telephone number that you have provided us, to: (i) notify you regarding your account; (ii) troubleshoot problems with your account; (iii) resolve a dispute; (iv) collect a debt; (v) poll your opinions through surveys or questionnaires; or (vi) as otherwise necessary to service your account or enforce this User Agreement, our policies, applicable law, or any other agreement we may have with you. eBay may also contact you using autodialed or prerecorded calls and text messages for marketing purposes (e.g., offers and promotions), if you consent to such communications. Our collection, use, disclosure, retention, and protection of your personal information is governed by the User Privacy Notice. As described in our User Privacy Notice, eBay may collect other telephone numbers for you and may place manual non-marketing calls to any of those numbers and autodialed non-marketing calls to any landline.

Additionally, you may not use information for marketing purposes, via electronic or other means, unless you obtain the consent of the specific user to do so.\n---Returns and Cancellations\n\tSellers can create rules to automate replacements, returns, and refunds under certain circumstances. For all new sellers, in listings where returns are accepted, eBay will set a default rule that automates the return process. Sellers may remove or customize their return preferences in their account settings within My eBay. Where settings have been set to automatically accept requests for returns or replacements, an eBay-generated return shipping label will be provided to your buyer. You agree to comply with our returns policy.\n\tWhen an item is returned, to refund the buyer, you (as seller) authorize eBay to request that PayPal remove the refund amount (in same or other currency) from your PayPal account, place the amount on your invoice, and/or charge your payment method on file.\n\tThe cost of return shipping for an item that is not as described is the seller's responsibility.\n\tYou (as seller) authorize eBay to place the return shipping label cost on your invoice, subject to your automatic payment method on file when:\n\t\nAn eBay-generated return shipping label is used, and the seller is responsible for its cost;\nReturns have been automated;\nYou fail to send your buyer a return shipping label and, instead, an eBay-generated shipping label is used; and/or\nA transaction is cancelled, and to refund the buyer, you (as seller) authorize eBay to request that PayPal remove the refund amount (in same or other currency) from your PayPal account. See Canceling a transaction for more details.\n---Global Shipping Program\n\tOne of the ways that we may make eBay.com listings available to international buyers on eBay.com and on eBay's International Sites is through the Global Shipping Program. For eligible items located in the United States and purchased by an international buyer through the Global Shipping Program, you (as seller) will simply ship the item to a parcel processing facility located in the United States after receiving notification of payment from your buyer. Pitney Bowes Inc., a third-party global shipping provider, will oversee the processing, customs clearance, and international shipment of the item on behalf of your international buyer. To the extent a buyer has a question about your Global Shipping Program listings, eBay may respond directly to the buyer if the question pertains to the services overseen by Pitney Bowes Inc. (for example, customs or international shipping). You pay no additional fees for selling through the Global Shipping Program.\n\tPursuant to a routed export transaction under the U.S. Export Administration Regulations and Foreign Trade Regulations, your buyer, as the Foreign Principal Party in Interest, will agree to assume responsibility for the export shipment, with Pitney Bowes Inc. acting as your buyer's forwarding agent. You remain liable for the accuracy of information you provide about items, and you agree to provide timely responses to requests for additional information.\n\tYou consent to the disclosure of certain personally identifiable information, as well as listing and order information, by eBay to Pitney Bowes Inc., and by Pitney Bowes Inc. to its affiliates, service providers, and other third parties (such as customs and revenue authorities, as well as other government agencies), in connection with the processing, export and customs clearance, and international transportation of any item. eBay does not control the privacy policies of Pitney Bowes Inc., its affiliates, or its service providers, and you are subject to the privacy policies of those parties, as applicable.\n\tAdditional information about the program, including policies governing feedback, the handling of lost, damaged, and undeliverable items, returns, and the resolution of buyer protection claims for items that you sell through the program, can be found on our Global Shipping Program - opens in new window or tab and Global Shipping FAQs - opens in new window or tab pages.\n---eBay Money Back Guarantee\n\tMost eBay sales go smoothly, but if there's a problem with a purchase, the eBay Money Back Guarantee helps buyers and sellers communicate and resolve issues. You agree to comply with the policy and permit us to make a final decision on any eBay Money Back Guarantee case.\n\tIf you (as seller), choose to reimburse a buyer, or are required to reimburse a buyer or eBay under the eBay Money Back Guarantee, you authorize eBay to request that PayPal remove the reimbursement amount (in same or other currency) from your PayPal account, place the amount on your invoice, and/or charge your payment method on file. If we cannot get reimbursement from you, we may collect the outstanding sums using other collection mechanisms, including retaining collection agencies.\n\tWe may suspend the eBay Money Back Guarantee in whole or in part without notice if we suspect abuse or interference with the proper working of the policy.\nWe try to keep our Services safe, secure, and functioning properly, but we cannot guarantee the continuous operation of or access to our Services. Bid update and other notification functionality in eBay's applications may not occur in real time. Such functionality is subject to delays beyond eBay's control.\nYou agree that you are making use of our Services at your own risk, and that they are being provided to you on an \"AS IS\" and \"AS AVAILABLE\" basis. Accordingly, to the extent permitted by applicable law, we exclude all express or implied warranties, terms and conditions including, but not limited to, implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and non-infringement.\nIn addition, to the extent permitted by applicable law, we (including our parent, subsidiaries, and affiliates, and our and their officers, directors, agents and employees) are not liable, and you agree not to hold us responsible, for any damages or losses (including, but not limited to, loss of money, goodwill or reputation, profits, other intangible losses, or any special, indirect, or consequential damages) resulting directly or indirectly from:\n---the content you provide (directly or indirectly) using the Services;\n---your use of or your inability to use our Services;\n---pricing, shipping, format, or other guidance provided by eBay;\n---delays or disruptions in our Services;\n---viruses or other malicious software obtained by accessing or linking to our Services;\n---glitches, bugs, errors, or inaccuracies of any kind in our Services;\n---damage to your hardware device from the use of any eBay Service;\n---the content, actions, or inactions of third parties, including items listed using our Services or the destruction of allegedly fake items;\n---a suspension or other action taken with respect to your account or breach of the Abusing eBay Section above;\n---the duration or manner in which your listings appear in search results as set out in the Listing Conditions Section above; or\n---your need to modify practices, content, or behavior, or your loss of or inability to do business, as a result of changes to this User Agreement or our policies.\nSome jurisdictions do not allow the disclaimer of warranties or exclusion of damages, so such disclaimers and exclusions may not apply to you.\nRegardless of the previous paragraphs, if we are found to be liable, our liability to you or to any third party is limited to the greater of (a) any amounts due under the eBay Money Back Guarantee up to the price the item sold for on eBay (including any applicable sales tax) and its original shipping costs, (b) the amount of fees in dispute not to exceed the total fees, which you paid to us in the 12 months prior to the action giving rise to the liability, or (c) $100.\nIf you have a dispute with one or more users, you release us (and our affiliates and subsidiaries, and our and their respective officers, directors, employees and agents) from claims, demands and damages (actual and consequential) of every kind and nature, known and unknown, arising out of or in any way connected with such disputes. In entering into this release you expressly waive any protections (whether statutory or otherwise) that would otherwise limit the coverage of this release to include only those claims which you may know or suspect to exist in your favor at the time of agreeing to this release.\nYou will indemnify and hold us (including our affiliates and subsidiaries, as well as our and their respective officers, directors, employees, agents) harmless from any claim or demand, including reasonable legal fees, made by any third party due to or arising out of your breach of this User Agreement, your improper use of eBay's Services or your breach of any law or the rights of a third party.\nPLEASE READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY. IT AFFECTS YOUR RIGHTS AND WILL HAVE A SUBSTANTIAL IMPACT ON HOW CLAIMS YOU AND EBAY HAVE AGAINST EACH OTHER ARE RESOLVED.\nYou and eBay agree that any claim or dispute at law or equity that has arisen, or may arise, between you and eBay (including any claim or dispute between you and a third-party agent of eBay) that relates in any way to or arises out of this or previous versions of this User Agreement, your use of or access to the Services, the actions of eBay or its agents, or any products or services sold or purchased through the Services, will be resolved in accordance with the provisions set forth in this Legal Disputes Section.\nA. Applicable Law\nYou agree that, except to the extent inconsistent with or preempted by federal law, the laws of the State of Utah, without regard to principles of conflict of laws, will govern this User Agreement and any claim or dispute that has arisen or may arise between you and eBay, except as otherwise stated in this User Agreement.\nB. Agreement to Arbitrate\nYou and eBay each agree that any and all disputes or claims that have arisen, or may arise, between you and eBay (including any disputes or claims between you and a third-party agent of eBay) that relate in any way to or arise out of this or previous versions of the User Agreement, your use of or access to the Services, the actions of eBay or its agents, or any products or services sold, offered, or purchased through the Services shall be resolved exclusively through final and binding arbitration, rather than in court. Alternatively, you may assert your claims in small claims court, if your claims qualify and so long as the matter remains in such court and advances only on an individual (non-class, non-representative) basis. The Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this Agreement to Arbitrate.\n---Prohibition of Class and Representative Actions and Non-Individualized Relief\nYOU AND EBAY AGREE THAT EACH OF US MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS, OR REPRESENTATIVE OR PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL ACTION OR PROCEEDING. UNLESS BOTH YOU AND EBAY AGREE OTHERWISE, THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE OR JOIN MORE THAN ONE PERSON'S OR PARTY'S CLAIMS, AND MAY NOT OTHERWISE PRESIDE OVER ANY FORM OF A CONSOLIDATED, REPRESENTATIVE, CLASS, OR PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL ACTION OR PROCEEDING. ALSO, THE ARBITRATOR MAY AWARD RELIEF (INCLUDING MONETARY, INJUNCTIVE, AND DECLARATORY RELIEF) ONLY IN FAVOR OF THE INDIVIDUAL PARTY SEEKING RELIEF AND ONLY TO THE EXTENT NECESSARY TO PROVIDE RELIEF NECESSITATED BY THAT PARTY'S INDIVIDUAL CLAIM(S). ANY RELIEF AWARDED CANNOT AFFECT OTHER USERS. If a court decides that applicable law precludes enforcement of any of this paragraph's limitations as to a particular claim for relief, then that claim (and only that claim) must be severed from the arbitration and may be brought in court, subject to your and eBay's right to appeal the court's decision. All other claims will be arbitrated.\n---Arbitration Procedures\nArbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in court. Arbitration uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, and court review of an arbitration award is very limited. However, an arbitrator can award the same damages and relief on an individual basis that a court can award to an individual. An arbitrator should apply the terms of the User Agreement as a court would. All issues are for the arbitrator to decide, except that issues relating to arbitrability, the scope or enforceability of this Agreement to Arbitrate, or the interpretation of Section 1 of this Agreement to Arbitrate (\"Prohibition of Class and Representative Actions and Non-Individualized Relief\"), shall be for a court of competent jurisdiction to decide.\nThe arbitration will be conducted by the American Arbitration Association (\"AAA\") under its rules and procedures, including the AAA's Consumer Arbitration Rules (as applicable), as modified by this Agreement to Arbitrate. The AAA's rules are available at www.adr.org or by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879. The use of the word \"arbitrator\" in this provision shall not be construed to prohibit more than one arbitrator from presiding over an arbitration; rather, the AAA's rules will govern the number of arbitrators that may preside over an arbitration conducted under this Agreement to Arbitrate.\nA party who intends to seek arbitration must first send to the other, by certified mail, a completed form Notice of Dispute (\"Notice\"). You may download a form Notice - opens in new window or tab. The Notice to eBay should be sent to eBay Inc., Attn: Litigation Department, Re: Notice of Dispute, 583 W. eBay Way, Draper, UT 84020. eBay will send any Notice to you to the physical address we have on file associated with your eBay account; it is your responsibility to keep your physical address up to date. All information called for in the Notice must be provided, including a description of the nature and basis of the claims the party is asserting and the relief sought.\nIf you and eBay are unable to resolve the claims described in the Notice within 30 days after the Notice is sent, you or eBay may initiate arbitration proceedings. A form for initiating arbitration proceedings is available on the AAA's site at www.adr.org. In addition to filing this form with the AAA in accordance with its rules and procedures, the party initiating the arbitration must mail a copy of the completed form to the opposing party. You may send a copy to eBay at the following address: eBay, Inc. c/o CT Corporation System, 1108 E South Union Ave., Midvale, UT 84047. In the event eBay initiates an arbitration against you, it will send a copy of the completed form to the physical address we have on file associated with your eBay account. Any settlement offer made by you or eBay shall not be disclosed to the arbitrator.\nThe arbitration hearing shall be held in the county in which you reside or at another mutually agreed location. If the value of the relief sought is $10,000 or less, you or eBay may elect to have the arbitration conducted by telephone or based solely on written submissions, which election shall be binding on you and eBay subject to the arbitrator's discretion to require an in-person hearing, if the circumstances warrant. In cases where an in-person hearing is held, you and/or eBay may attend by telephone, unless the arbitrator requires otherwise.\nThe arbitrator will decide the substance of all claims in accordance with applicable law, including recognized principles of equity, and will honor all claims of privilege recognized by law. The arbitrator shall not be bound by rulings in prior arbitrations involving different users, but is bound by rulings in prior arbitrations involving the same eBay user to the extent required by applicable law. The arbitrator's award shall be final and binding and judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof.\n---Costs of Arbitration\nPayment of all filing, administration and arbitrator fees will be governed by the AAA's rules, unless otherwise stated in this Agreement to Arbitrate. If the value of the relief sought is $10,000 or less, at your request, eBay will pay all filing, administration, and arbitrator fees associated with the arbitration. Any request for payment of fees by eBay should be submitted by mail to the AAA along with your Demand for Arbitration and eBay will make arrangements to pay all necessary fees directly to the AAA.

When connecting the Extension with your account, Extension ID and version will be exchanged with flattr.com for security reasons.  Your browsing behavior in the Extension (automatically) The function of the extension is to determine what content (normally a URL) to flattr. Within the Extension only, we record interaction, browsing and navigation data to identify the content to flattr so your flattrs are actually given to the content you consume, you engage with and you pay attention to. This is only done locally in your browser and this data is never sent to us.  Within the Extension, meaning in your browser, under your control and not being sent to us, current measures to detect activity / inactivity are  ---browsing data and timestamps, specifically URLs you visit (including previously visited pages) and the page title, on some multi-author pages (currently youtube.com only) the author of the respective webpage,  information about tabs (creating, selecting, moving or closing tabs in the user interface, including which window and at which position the tab was created, as well as which window created it in case of popups, and whether a tab is audible and/or muted and also when this status changes),  page load statuses to identify error pages, and browser idle state changes.     Also within the Extension, meaning in your browser, under your control and not being sent to us, we record   ---interaction data and timestamps, specifically  the occurrence of mouse movement,  clicking, scrolling (including beginning and end scroll positions, as well as page width / height),  zooming (including the zoom level) and  the occurrence of keys being pressed.     Even within the Extension, we never record your mouse position and / or the exact keys you press. Again please note, that this data is recorded only in the Extension and thus only on your device. This data will never be sent to us or any other party. It is used to determine your activity and engagement with sites and which sites will get your flattrs.

Your liability for unauthorized use of your card may be limited by your card issuer\u2019s agreement with you and/or by applicable law. In addition to the uses of account information authorized by the TOS, Oath may access, preserve, monitor and disclose your card information in the good faith belief that such action is reasonably necessary to verify your account, to identify or resolve problems, or to respond to inquiries about any of your Flickr Services, but nothing in this section shall impose a duty on Oath to make any such disclosures.\n---\nCONTENT: IP OWNERSHIP AND LICENSE GRANT\nIf you agreed to a version of the Oath Terms of Service that was last modified on or after March 23, 2018 (the \u201cNew Oath TOS\u201d), the following section applies to you:\nThese additional terms for Flickr Pro subscribers are in addition to Oath\u2019s Terms of Service and, for Flickr Pro subscribers these terms supersede Oath\u2019s Terms of Service only as to the IP Ownership and License Grant in Section 6(b) of Oath\u2019s Terms of Service.  Oath and all of its brands listed in Section 13 of Oath\u2019s Terms of Service (including Oath, AOL, and Flickr brands) and the corporate entities listed in Sections 13 and 14 of Oath\u2019s Terms of Service (collectively, \u201cOath,\u201d \u201cus,\u201d \u201cwe\u201d or \u201cour\u201d) are part of the Verizon family of companies. Our brands, websites, apps, products, services and technologies are referred to as the \u201cServices.\u201d\nAs a Flickr Pro subscription member, when you upload, share with or submit content including photos and graphics (the \u201cContent\u201d) to the Services, you retain ownership of any intellectual property rights that you hold in that Content.  However, with respect to Content you submit or make available for inclusion on publicly accessible areas of the Services, you grant Oath the following worldwide, royalty-free and non-exclusive license:  the license to use, distribute, reproduce, modify, adapt, publicly perform and publicly display such Content on the Services solely for the purpose for which such Content was submitted or made available. This license exists only for as long as you elect to continue to include such Content on the Services and will terminate at the time you remove or Oath removes such Content from the Services.  You must have the necessary rights to grant us the license described in this section for any Content that you upload, share with or submit to the Services.\n\"Publicly accessible\" areas of the Services are those areas of the Oath network of properties that are intended by Oath to be available to the general public. By way of example, publicly accessible areas of the Services would include portions of Flickr that are open to both members and visitors. However, publicly accessible areas of the Services would not include portions of Flickr that are limited to members, Services intended for private communication such as Oath Mail, or areas off of the Oath network of properties such as portions of World Wide Web sites that are accessible via hypertext or other links but are not hosted or served by Oath.\n---\nPAYMENT, ACCOUNT UPDATER, FRAUD PROTECTIONS AND TERMINATION\nPayment Terms\nYour credit card will automatically be charged the current fee for the Flickr Service you choose on the date that you click the \u201cSubmit order\u201d button in the ordering process. If you do not cancel the Flickr Service you ordered by the end of the current term, your credit card on file will also automatically be charged the then-current fee for that Flickr Service at the commencement of each renewal term. Fees can not be credited towards other services. Current fees are posted on Flickr at https://www.flickr.com/account/upgrade/pro. All currency references are in U.S. dollars. Please note, payment for the Service is non-refundable, unless Oath expressly provides otherwise. To cancel the Service visit https://flickr.com/account/wallet. If you cancel you will continue to keep the service until the end of your subscription term.\nAccount Updater\nAs a convenience to its users, Oath may subscribe to a third party service that can attempt to refresh expired credit card or debit card numbers with the numbers of replacement cards so that users\u2019 paid services do not lapse because the payment instrument initially on file with Oath has expired (\u201cAccount Updater\u201d). By buying a Flickr Service, you consent to Oath\u2019s disclosure of your registration information to this third party service and to that service\u2019s use of such information solely in connection with Account Updater. You also consent to Oath\u2019s receipt and use of updated credit card or debit card account information from your financial institution in connection with the provision of the service as provided in the TOS, these Additional Terms, the Privacy Policy, and the Community Guidelines.\nFraud Protections\nTo protect against fraud, Oath may verify the credit card information you provide. The verification process may include debiting an amount between $0.00 and $1.00 from your credit card account and then immediately crediting the same amount back to your credit card. Oath will only use this process to screen for fraud and will not otherwise debit your credit card account except as part of a transaction conducted through your account for the Service. By providing Oath with your credit card information, you authorize Oath to debit and credit your credit card account for an amount less than or equal to one dollar for such verification purposes.\nTermination\nIf your credit card is invalid for any reason, your account will revert to a free Flickr account and will be subject to the limitations of a free Flickr account; provided, however, that Oath reserves the right to cancel your account entirely in such case, whereupon all the information and content contained within it will be deleted permanently. Oath accepts no liability for data that is deleted due to an invalid credit card.\n---\nAGE REQUIREMENTS\nThe Flickr Services are available for individuals 13 or older. If you are 13 or older but under the age of 18, you should review these terms and conditions with your parent or guardian to make sure that you and your parent or guardian understand and agree to these terms and conditions.\n---\nACCEPTANCE OF TERMS\nWelcome to Flickr Gift Certificate. By purchasing a Flickr Gift Certificate, you agree to these Gift Purchaser Terms at https://www.flickr.com/gift_terms_purchaser.gne that supplement the Oath Terms of Service (\u201cTOS\u201d) at https://www.flickr.com/utos_detect.gne (and any successor pages), which are incorporated by reference.\nSeparate Terms of Service govern the redemption and use of the gift certificate and the use of the product by the recipient, and must be agreed by the recipient of a gift certificate prior to redemption of the gift certificate and use of the product. Those terms are at https://www.flickr.com/gift_terms_redeemer.gne, and any successor pages. Oath reserves the right to update and change, from time to time, these Gift Purchaser Terms and all documents incorporated by reference. You can always find the most recent version of these Gift Purchaser Terms and the most recent version of the TOS at the URLs indicated above.\n---\nDESCRIPTION OF SERVICE\nCertain Flickr services allow the purchase of gift certificates, in which the cost of a subscription to that service may be given to another user as a gift. Flickr Gift Certificates can only be purchased on the Flickr site, and a particular gift certificate may only be applied toward the purchase of the Flickr service for which it is being offered.\nGift certificates may be purchased in set amounts. Flickr Gift Certificates may not be used to purchase other Flickr Gift Certificates or any other Oath Services or Oath Gift Certificates.\n---\nELIGIBILITY\nA Flickr Gift Certificate may only be sold to persons 13 or older. Oath reserves the right to restrict the availability of a Flickr Gift Certificate to residents of certain U.S. states, with or without notice.\nA Flickr Gift Certificate is intended for use as a gift to an individual. A Flickr Gift Certificate is non-transferable, and resale of a Flickr Gift Certificate or use for unauthorized advertising, marketing, sweepstakes or other promotional purposes is strictly prohibited. You agree that Oath has the right to suspend or terminate your account and refuse any and all current or future use of gift certificates and balances (or any portion thereof) obtained or used under such circumstances.\n---\nPURCHASE REQUIREMENTS\nTo purchase a Flickr Gift Certificate, you must provide Oath your credit card, billing and shipping information and other information (\u201cRegistration Data\u201d), which will be stored. You agree that the Registration Data is valid and complete and you will maintain and promptly update that information to keep it valid and complete. If you do not have a an account, you will be prompted to register for one before you can pay for a Flickr Gift Certificate.\nYou, and not Oath, are responsible for all purchases (including any unauthorized purchases or errors) made through Oath or in connection with your account. You must resolve purchase-related disputes with and promptly report unauthorized use of your credit card to your credit card company, online payment service provider, merchant, or bank. Your liability for unauthorized use of your card may be limited by your card issuer\u2019s agreement with you and/or by applicable law. In addition to the uses of account information authorized by the TOS, Oath may access, preserve, monitor and disclose your card information in the good faith belief that such action is reasonably necessary to verify your account, to identify or resolve problems, or to respond to inquiries about any of your Flickr Services, but nothing in this section shall impose a duty on Oath to make any such disclosures.\n---\nFEES AND CHARGES\nFlickr may, upon notice required by applicable laws, at any time: (i) change the amount of, or basis for determining, any fee or charge related to any Flickr Gift Certificate, or (ii) institute new fees or charges related to a Flickr Gift Certificate.\n---\nNO REFUNDS\nOnce your order is processed and confirmed by Oath, your gift certificate purchase is final. You will not be able to cancel your Flickr gift certificate order, and you will not be entitled to any refunds or credits.\n---\nEXPIRATION\nA Flickr Gift Certificate does not expire. However, you understand and agree that receipt and acceptance of the Flickr Gift Certificate by your intended recipient will be deemed to have occurred when the recipient provides their consent to Oath to receive the gift or, in the case of a gift generating a gift code, when the recipient enters the gift code associated with the Flickr Gift Certificate on to the Flickr site and successfully applies the value associated with that gift to their Flickr account. In the unlikely event that your Flickr Gift Certificate is not received and accepted by your intended recipient twelve (12) months from the date that your payment for such gift certificate is finalized, then the Flickr Gift Certificate will be applied to your own Flickr account. By way of example and not limitation, if you purchase a one year Flickr Gift Certificate and the intended recipient of the Flickr Gift Certificate does not receive and accept the one year certificate twelve (12) months from the date of payment, one year of Pro status will be added to your own Flickr account. There are presently no service fees for the maintenance of unaccepted Flickr Gift Certificates.\n---\nNO REPLACEMENT\nFlickr Gift Certificates will not be replaced if they are lost, stolen, or used without permission.\n---\nTERMINATION\nOath reserves the right to close customer accounts and request alternative forms of payment if a Flickr Gift Certificate is obtained or used fraudulently on the Flickr site.\n---\nNO LIABILITY\nA Flickr Gift Certificate is provided \u201cAS-IS\u201d, and Oath assumes no responsibility for the timeliness, deletion, mis-delivery, misapplication or failure to store any user communications personalization settings, or balance.\nLast updated: 2018-04-03\n", "http://www.flickr.com/help/guidelines/": "\n \nFlickr Community guidelines | Flickr\nnew icn messageflickr-free-ic3d pan white\nFlickr accounts are intended for members to share original photos and video that they themselves have created.\nThese Community Guidelines are here to help you understand what it means to be a member of Flickr. Don't forget that your use of Flickr is subject to these Community Guidelines and our Terms of Service.\nThings to do\n---\nPlay nice\nWe're a global community of many types of people, who all have the right to feel comfortable and who may not think what you think, believe what you believe, or see what you see. So, be polite and respectful in your interactions with other members.\n---\nOnly upload content that you have created.\nRespect the copyright of others. This means don't steal photos or videos that other people have shared and pass them off as your own. (That's what favorites and galleries are for.)\n---\nModerate your content.\nAll content on Flickr, whether public or private, has to be appropriately moderated using our safety and content filters.\n---\nLink back to Flickr when you post your Flickr content elsewhere.\nFlickr makes it possible to post content hosted on Flickr to other web sites. Pages on other web sites that display content hosted on Flickr must provide a link from each photo or video back to its page on Flickr. This provides a way to get more information about the content and the photographer.\n---\nEnjoy Flickr!\nThis is your community. Celebrate your creativity, be social and share what's important to you. See the world through others' eyes, participate, find your muse, and expand your horizons!\nThings not to do\nHere's the deal: We like to give second chances. However, when we discover you stepping across any of the lines listed below, we will take action, which may mean deleting your account with or without warning.\n---\nDon't upload collections of photos that aren\u2019t yours.\nThis includes other people's photos, video, and/or stuff you've copied or collected from around the Internet. Accounts that consist of such collections may be deleted at any time.\n---\nDon't violate copyright laws\nIf you see photos or videos that you've created in another member's photostream, don't panic. This is probably just a misunderstanding and not malicious. A good first step is to contact them via FlickrMail and politely ask them to remove it. If that doesn\u2019t work, you can file a Notice with Flickr's Designated Copyright Agent.\n---\nDon't forget to moderate your content\nSet the appropriate content filters for your images and videos. In general, anything containing mature content (e.g. nudity, gore) needs to be moderated appropriately.  This includes your buddy icon and cover photo. Also, sexually explicit videos (e.g. pornography) are not permitted. Videos of artistic nature or educational purpose that contain nudity may be allowed under the moderate safety setting. For additional details check here.\n---\nDon\u2019t forget to set the appropriate content type\nSet the appropriate content type for your images. In general, anything that is not a photo or video should be classified as a Screenshot or Art/Illustration. For additional details check here.\n---\nDon\u2019t harm children\nTo say that Flickr has a zero tolerance policy towards harmful content involving minors would be an understatement. In protecting children from criminal predators, particularly in crimes involving child sexual abuse, we will aggressively report and cooperate with law enforcement with the goal of prosecuting to the full extent of the law. This includes, but is not limited to, images, video, comments, faves, and other communications.\n---\nDon't be creepy.\nYou know the guy. Don't be that guy. If you are that guy, your account will be deleted.\n---\nDon't upload content that is illegal or prohibited.\nThis includes but is not limited to drug use, bestiality, and terrorism. If we find you doing it, your account will be deleted and we'll take appropriate action, which may include reporting you to law enforcement.\n---\nDon\u2019t harass other users\nFlickr is not a venue for you to harass, abuse, spam, impersonate, or intimidate others. So, be polite and respectful in your interactions with other users.\n---\nDon\u2019t violate users\u2019 privacy.\nFlickr has a zero tolerance policy towards distributing sexually graphic images of another person without that person\u2019s consent (Non-Consensual Pornography). If you\u2019re a victim, please go here for 24-hour support, and here to meet the Badass Army.\n---\nDon\u2019t use hate speech.\nFlickr has a zero-tolerance policy towards attacking a person or group based on, but is not limited to, race, ethnicity, national origin, religion, disability, disease, age, sexual orientation, gender, or gender identity. Here are some suggestions for confronting hate online.\n---\nDon\u2019t promote or encourage self-harm.\nWe do not tolerate promotion of self-harm or the encouragement of others to do things that might cause them to get hurt.\n---\nDon't host web graphics\nFlickr is not a place to host generic graphic elements of web page designs, logos, banners, icons, and other non-photographic elements.\n---\nDon\u2019t spam\nWe do not tolerate spam, period. This includes, but is not limited to, excessive favoriting, excessive commenting, deceptive tagging, deceptive photo titles and descriptions, or resource abuse.\n---\nDon't use Flickr for commercial activity, unless you\u2019re a Flickr Pro.\nOnly Flickr Pro members are permitted to link directly to a shopping cart, checkout page, or pricing pages on other sites. Flickr Pros may also list prices for their products in their Flickr photo descriptions. For more information about Flickr Pro accounts go here.\nIn Conclusion\nIf you don't feel that you can abide by our Community Guidelines as outlined above, maybe Flickr isn't for you. We've crafted these guidelines to ensure that everyone within the Flickr community has a good time.\nYou may also want to check out our Help Center and Privacy Policy.

Unless otherwise specified in the additional terms that apply to the Services you are using, the terms in this Section 11 apply to you.\r\n\t\nWe offer products and subscriptions for a fee (\u201cfee-based Services\u201d). These fee-based Services are governed by the additional terms you agree to when you register for the fee-based Service and these Terms. If you register for a fee-based Service, you must designate a payment method and provide us with accurate billing and payment information and you have the continuing obligation to keep it up to date. Many fee-based Services require you to have, or register for, a Yahoo or AOL or other Oath ID. If you are an AOL Dial-Up customer, please find additional terms here.\nThe following important provisions apply to all of our fee-based services:\r\n\t\t\nThird-Party products. If the fee-based Service includes a third-party product, you understand and agree that your purchase and use of the Service is also subject to the third party\u2019s terms of service and privacy policy, which you should read thoroughly before agreeing to them.\nPayments. You represent that you are at least the minimum age required to enter into a legal agreement. You agree to pay us for any fee-based Services you purchase from us, as well as all other charges incurred under your account, including applicable taxes and fees. You are responsible for all charges incurred under your account, including purchases made by you or anyone you allow to use your account or any sub-or linked accounts (including any person with implied, actual, or apparent authority) or anyone who gains access to your account as a result of your failure to safeguard your authentication credentials.\nPayment Methods. You authorize and direct us to charge your designated payment method for these charges or, if it fails, to charge any other payment method you have on file with us, even if we received it in association with other fee-based services. You are responsible for all charges even if your payment method fails or is denied. You authorize and direct us to retain all information about any payment method(s) associated with your account. We may import payment information you entered during a prior purchase and provide you the option to use that payment information during purchase of a new product. You permit us to obtain and use updated information from the issuer of your payment method in accordance with the policies and procedures of any applicable card brands. We may in some instances continue charging a payment method past its expiration date at our discretion and subject to the payment processors' or issuing bank's approval. Surcharges may apply if you use certain payment methods, such as payment from your checking or savings account.\nPayment Terms. We may charge for fee-based Services in advance and on a daily, monthly, yearly, lump sum, or other basis in accordance with the stated terms, as long as your subscription remains active, even if you have not downloaded or used the Service or accessed your online account.\nAuto-Renewal. We use auto-renewal for many of our fee-based Services. At the expiration of each subscription term for such fee-based Services, we will automatically renew your subscription and charge the credit card or other payment method you have provided to us, unless you cancel your subscription at least 48 hours before the end of the current period. Unless otherwise stated in Section 14, your subscription will be automatically renewed at the then-current price, excluding promotional and discount pricing. We may, in our sole discretion, post charges to your payment method individually or aggregate charges for some or all of your fee-based Services with us.\nFraud Protection. We may take steps to verify the validity of the credit card information you provide to us, including debiting amounts less than $1.00 from your credit card and then immediately crediting it back. You authorize us to do so for verification and anti-fraud purposes.\nFree Trials. We may offer you free trials, so that you may try a fee-based Service subscription without charge or obligation (\"Free Trial\"). Unless otherwise stated and unless you cancel your subscription prior to the expiration of the Free Trial, periodic subscription fees will be charged at the then-applicable rate upon expiration of the Free Trial period and will continue to be charged until the subscription is canceled. If you are not satisfied with a particular fee-based Service, you must cancel the subscription before the Free Trial ends to avoid charges. We reserve the right to limit you to one free trial or promotion of a fee-based Service and to prohibit the combining of free trials or other promotional offers.\nNo Refunds. All charges are nonrefundable unless provided otherwise in the terms you agree to when you register for a fee-based Service, unless stated differently for your country in Section 15 or as otherwise specified below.\nTermination. We, in our sole discretion, may change, discontinue or terminate any or all aspects of a fee-based Service without notice, including access to support services, content and other products or services ancillary to the fee-based Service, subject to providing an appropriate refund for any portions of a specified but no longer available term. You may cancel a fee-based Service at any time by logging into your online account and terminating the\u00a0subscription.\nChange in Fees and Billing Method. We may change our fees and billing methods at any time. We will provide you with notice of any price increase at least thirty (30) days in advance. Subject to applicable law, (i) if you disagree with any proposed change, your sole remedy is to cancel your fee-based Service before the price change takes effect and (ii) your continued use of or subscription to the Service after the price change takes effect constitutes your agreement to pay the new price for the Service.\nDelinquency. After 30 days from the date of any unpaid charges, your fee-based Service will be deemed delinquent and we may terminate or suspend your account and fee-based Service for nonpayment. You are liable for any fees, including attorney and collection fees, incurred by us in our efforts to collect any remaining balances from you.\n90-Day Notice Period. You must notify us about any billing problems or discrepancies within 90 days after they first appear on your billing method statement. If you do not bring them to our attention within 90 days, you agree that you waive your right to dispute such problems or discrepancies.\n---About these Terms\nThird Party Beneficiaries and Conflicts. These Terms control the relationship between Oath and you. They do not create any third party beneficiary rights. If there is a conflict or inconsistency between the terms in this document and the additional terms associated with a particular Service, the additional terms will control solely for that conflict or inconsistency.\nModification of the Terms. Unless stated differently for your country in Section 14, we may modify the Terms from time to time. Unless we indicate otherwise, modifications will be effective as of the date they are posted on this page or any successor page. You should look at the Terms regularly. We will provide notice (in accordance with Section 3(c) above) of material modifications.\nContinued Use of the Services. You may stop using the Services at any time, but your continued use of or subscription to a Service after the effective date of any modifications to the Terms or the means that you agree to the Terms as modified.\nWaiver and Severability of Terms. The failure of Oath to exercise or enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not constitute a waiver of such right or provision. If any provision (or part of a provision) of these Terms is found to be invalid, Oath and you nevertheless agree to give effect to the intentions as reflected in the provision, and the other provisions of these Terms remain in full force and effect.\nAssignment by Oath. Oath may freely assign these Terms and all of the policies and other documents incorporated or referenced in it (including all rights, licenses, and obligations under it or them), in whole or in part and without notice, for any reason, including for the purpose of internal restructuring (for example, mergers or liquidations).\n---Provider of Services\nThe Services are provided by the company that offers the Services in your region as set out in Section 14.2\u00a0(the \u201cApplicable Oath Company\u201d), except for the Services set out below in Section 13(b).

YOU AND OATH BOTH AGREE TO RESOLVE ANY AND ALL DISPUTES, CONTROVERSIES OR CLAIMS THAT IN ANY WAY ARISE OUT OF OR RELATE TO THESE TERMS OR FROM ANY SERVICES YOU RECEIVE FROM US (OR FROM ANY ADVERTISING FOR ANY SUCH SERVICES), INCLUDING ANY DISPUTES BETWEEN YOU AND OUR EMPLOYEES OR AGENTS (\u201cDISPUTE(S)\u201d), ONLY BY ARBITRATION ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS OR IN SMALL CLAIMS COURT. YOU UNDERSTAND THAT BY AGREEING TO THESE TERMS, ARBITRATION OR A SMALL CLAIMS ACTION WILL BE THE SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE MEANS OF RESOLVING ANY DISPUTE BETWEEN US. YOU ALSO UNDERSTAND THAT BY AGREEING TO THESE TERMS, YOU AND OATH ARE GIVING UP THE RIGHT TO BRING A CLAIM IN COURT OR IN FRONT OF A JURY (EXCEPT FOR MATTERS THAT MAY BE BROUGHT IN SMALL CLAIMS COURT), AND THAT YOU AND OATH ARE GIVING UP THE RIGHT TO PROCEED WITH ANY CLASS ACTION OR OTHER REPRESENTATIVE ACTION. WHILE ARBITRATION PROCEDURES MAY BE DIFFERENT THAN COURT PROCEDURES, AN ARBITRATOR CAN AWARD YOU INDIVIDUALLY THE SAME DAMAGES AND RELIEF AS A COURT, AND JUDGMENT ON THE AWARD RENDERED BY THE ARBITRATOR MAY BE ENTERED AND ENFORCED IN ANY COURT HAVING JURISDICTION THEREOF. THE PARTIES UNDERSTAND THAT ABSENT THIS MANDATORY PROVISION, THEY WOULD HAVE THE RIGHT TO SUE IN COURT AND HAVE A JURY TRIAL. THEY FURTHER UNDERSTAND THAT, IN SOME INSTANCES, THE COSTS OF ARBITRATION COULD EXCEED THE COSTS OF LITIGATION AND THE RIGHT TO DISCOVERY MAY BE MORE LIMITED IN ARBITRATION THAN IN COURT. We also both agree that:\nNotice of Dispute. If either you or Oath intends to arbitrate under these Terms, the party seeking arbitration must first notify the other party of the Dispute in writing at least 30 days in advance of initiating the arbitration. Notice to Oath should be sent to Oath either by mail to Oath, Attn: Disputes, 701 First Avenue, Sunnyvale, CA 94089; or disputes@oath.com. Notice to you will be to your email address(es) and street address(es), if any, that Oath has in its records at the time the notice is sent. The notice must describe the nature of the claim and the relief being sought. If we are unable to resolve the Dispute within 30 days, either party may then proceed to file a claim for arbitration.\nArbitration Procedure. The Federal Arbitration Act applies to these Terms. Except for small claims court cases, any and all Disputes will be resolved by arbitration administered by the American Arbitration Association (\"AAA\"). The AAA will apply the Commercial Arbitration Rules to the arbitration of any Dispute pursuant to these Terms, unless you are an individual and use the Services for personal or household use, in which case the AAA's Consumer Arbitration Rules will apply (excluding any rules or procedures governing or permitting class actions). You can get procedures (including the process for beginning an arbitration), rules and fee information from the AAA (www.adr.org). These Terms govern to the extent they conflict with the AAA\u2019s Commercial Arbitration Rules or Consumer Arbitration Rules.\nSmall Claims Court Option. As an alternative to arbitration, you may bring an individual action in small claims court in your county of residence (or if a business, your principal place of business) or Santa Clara County, California provided that your Dispute meets the requirements of the small claims court.\nArbitration Location. Unless you and Oath agree otherwise, the arbitration must take place, or the small claims action must be filed, in the county of your primary residence or Santa Clara County, California.\nArbitration Fees and Expenses. We will reimburse any filing fee that the AAA charges you for arbitration of the Dispute. If you provide us with signed written notice that you cannot pay the filing fee, we will pay the fee directly to the AAA. If the arbitration proceeds, we will also pay any administrative and arbitrator fees charged later.\nSettlement Offers. We may, but are not obligated to, make a written settlement offer anytime before or during arbitration. The amount or terms of any settlement offer may not be disclosed to the arbitrator unless and until the arbitrator issues an award on the claim. If you do not accept the offer and the arbitrator awards you an amount of money that is more than our offer but less than $5,000, we agree to: (a) pay you $5,000 instead of the lower amount awarded, (b) pay your reasonable attorney\u2019s fees and costs, and (c) reimburse any arbitration filing fees and arbitrator fees and expenses incurred in connection with the arbitration of your Dispute. If the arbitrator awards you more than $5,000 and we are not challenging the award, then we will pay you the amount of the award.\nSeverability. If any part of this agreement to arbitrate is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be unenforceable, the court will reform the agreement to the extent necessary to cure the unenforceable part(s), and the parties will arbitrate their Dispute(s) without reference to or reliance upon the unenforceable part(s). However, if for any reason the Class Action Waiver set forth below in subsection 14.2.c cannot be enforced as to some or all of the Dispute, then the agreement to arbitrate will not apply to that Dispute or portion thereof. Any Disputes covered by any deemed unenforceable Class Action Waiver provision may only be litigated in a court of competent jurisdiction, but the remainder of the agreement to arbitrate will be binding and enforceable. To avoid any doubt or uncertainty, the parties do not agree to class arbitration or to the arbitration of any claims brought on behalf of others.\nCLASS ACTION WAIVER FOR U.S. USERS. THESE TERMS DO NOT ALLOW CLASS OR COLLECTIVE ARBITRATIONS, EVEN IF THE AAA PROCEDURES OR RULES WOULD. NOTWITHSTANDING ANY OTHER PROVISION OF THESE TERMS, THE ARBITRATOR MAY AWARD MONEY OR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF ONLY IN FAVOR OF THE INDIVIDUAL PARTY SEEKING RELIEF AND ONLY TO THE EXTENT NECESSARY TO PROVIDE THE RELIEF WARRANTED BY THAT PARTY'S INDIVIDUAL CLAIM. ARBITRATION OR COURT PROCEEDINGS HELD UNDER THESE TERMS CANNOT BE BROUGHT, MAINTAINED OR RESOLVED ON BEHALF OF OR BY A CLASS, AS A PRIVATE ATTORNEY-GENERAL, OR IN ANY OTHER REPRESENTATIVE CAPACITY. IN ADDITION, INDIVIDUAL PROCEEDINGS CANNOT BE COMBINED WITHOUT THE CONSENT OF ALL OF THE PARTIES. ANY QUESTION REGARDING THE ENFORCEABILITY OR INTERPRETATION OF THIS PARAGRAPH WILL BE DECIDED BY A COURT AND NOT THE ARBITRATOR.\nJURY TRIAL WAIVER FOR U.S. USERS. IF FOR ANY REASON A DISPUTE PROCEEDS IN COURT RATHER THAN THROUGH ARBITRATION, YOU AND OATH AGREE THAT THERE WILL NOT BE A JURY TRIAL. YOU AND OATH UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVE ANY RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION, PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM IN ANY WAY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THESE TERMS. IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, THIS PARAGRAPH MAY BE FILED TO SHOW A WRITTEN CONSENT TO A TRIAL BY THE COURT.\nChoice of Law. These Terms and the relationship between the parties, including any claim or dispute that might arise between the parties, whether sounding in contract, tort, or otherwise, will be governed by the laws of the State of New York without regard to its conflict of law provisions. In no event will the parties bring claims against one another under the laws of another jurisdiction.\nForum. If for any reason a Dispute proceeds in court rather than through arbitration, all such Disputes (regardless of theory) arising out of or relating to these Terms, or the relationship between you and Oath, will be brought exclusively in the courts located in the county of New York, New York or the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York. In such cases, you and Oath agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of the courts located within the county of New York, New York or the Southern District of New York, and agree to waive any and all objections to the exercise of jurisdiction over the parties by such courts and to venue in such courts.\nCustomer Support.

THEY FURTHER UNDERSTAND THAT, IN SOME INSTANCES, THE COSTS OF ARBITRATION COULD EXCEED THE COSTS OF LITIGATION AND THE RIGHT TO DISCOVERY MAY BE MORE LIMITED IN ARBITRATION THAN IN COURT. We also both agree that:\nNotice of Dispute. If either you or Oath intends to arbitrate under these Terms, the party seeking arbitration must first notify the other party of the Dispute in writing at least 30 days in advance of initiating the arbitration. Notice to Oath should be sent to Oath either by mail to Oath, Attn: Disputes, 701 First Avenue, Sunnyvale, CA 94089; or disputes@oath.com.

We will reimburse any filing fee that the AAA charges you for arbitration of the Dispute. If you provide us with signed written notice that you cannot pay the filing fee, we will pay the fee directly to the AAA. If the arbitration proceeds, we will also pay any administrative and arbitrator fees charged later.\nSettlement Offers. We may, but are not obligated to, make a written settlement offer anytime before or during arbitration. The amount or terms of any settlement offer may not be disclosed to the arbitrator unless and until the arbitrator issues an award on the claim.

Each of you and Company agrees to give up the right to sue in court. The term \"Dispute\" is to be given the broadest possible meaning that will be enforced, and shall include any dispute, claim, demand, count, cause of action, or controversy between you and Company, whether based in contract, statute, regulation, ordinance, tort (including, but not limited to, fraud, misrepresentation, fraudulent inducement, negligence, or any other intentional tort), or any other legal or equitable theory. The term \"Dispute\" specifically includes, but is not limited to, any and all claims between you and Company in any way related to or concerning this Arbitration Agreement, any other aspect of these Terms of Use (including their applicability and their conformance to applicable law), any products or services provided by Company, any billing disputes, and any disputes relating to telephonic, text message, or any other communications either of us received from the other. The only exceptions to this Arbitration Agreement are that (i) each of you and Company retains the right to sue in small claims court and (ii) each of you and Company may bring suit in court against the other to enjoin infringement or other misuse of intellectual property rights. Disputes over whether these exceptions apply shall be resolved by the court in which such action has been brought; all other disputes over arbitrability shall be resolved by the arbitrator. Each of you and Company also agrees to give up the ability to seek to represent, in a class action or otherwise, anyone but each of you and Company (see paragraph 9 below). There is no judge or jury in arbitration, and court review of an arbitration award is limited. An arbitrator must follow this Agreement. The arbitrator, however, can award on an individual basis the same damages and relief as a court (including injunctive and declaratory relief, or statutory damages).\n(2) This Agreement evidences a transaction in interstate commerce, and thus the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1-16, governs the interpretation and enforcement of this Arbitration Agreement. This Arbitration Agreement shall survive termination of this Agreement.\n(3) Any arbitration between you and Company will be conducted by the Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Services, Inc. (\"JAMS\"), pursuant to the JAMS Streamlined Arbitration Rules & Procedures effective July 1, 2014 (the \"JAMS Rules\"), as modified by this agreement to arbitrate. The arbitration shall be conducted by a single, neutral arbitrator, and if you and Company cannot agree on who that single arbitrator will be, the arbitrator will be appointed pursuant to the JAMS Rules, with the participation and involvement of Company and you pursuant to JAMS Rule 12. The JAMS Rules are available on its website at https://www.jamsadr.com/rules-streamlined-arbitration/ . The Consumer Arbitration Minimum Standards are available at https://www.jamsadr.com/rules-streamlined-arbitration/. The arbitrator is bound by the terms of this Agreement.\n(4) If either you or Company wants to arbitrate a claim, you or Company must first send by mail to the other a written Notice of Dispute (\"Notice\") that sets forth the name, address, and contact information of the party giving notice, the specific facts giving rise to the Dispute, the Company Service to which the Notice relates, and the relief requested. Your Notice to the Company must be sent by mail to Arbitration Notice of Dispute, 2121 Avenue of the Stars, 7th Floor, Los Angeles, California, 90067. The Company will send any Notice to you at the contact information we have for you or that you provide. It is the sender's responsibility to ensure that the recipient receives the Notice. During the first 45 days after you or we send a Notice to the other, you and we may try to reach a settlement of the Dispute.\nIf you and we do not resolve the Dispute within 45 days, either you or we may initiate arbitration in accordance with the JAMS Rules. Further instructions on submitting a Demand for Arbitration may be found at www.jamsadr.com/files/Uploads/Documents/JAMS_Arbitration_Demand.pdf. In addition to filing this Demand for Arbitration with JAMS in accordance with its rules and procedures, you must send a copy of this completed Demand for Arbitration to the Company at the address listed above to which you sent your Notice of Dispute.\n(5) You and the Company acknowledge and agree to abide by the following rules for arbitration: (a) YOU AND COMPANY MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS, REPRESENTATIVE OR MULTI-CLAIMANT PROCEEDING, AND THE ARBITRATOR SHALL HAVE NO POWER TO AWARD CLASS-WIDE RELIEF; (b) the Company will pay arbitration costs as required by the JAMS Consumer Arbitration Minimum Standards and consistent with paragraph 6 below; (c) the arbitrator may award any individual relief or individual remedies that are permitted by applicable law; and (d) each side pays his, her or its own attorneys' fees, except as otherwise provided in paragraph 8 below.\n(6) JAMS charges filing and other fees to conduct arbitrations. Ordinarily, the claimant has to pay the filing fee to initiate arbitration, but if you wish to commence an arbitration against Company, you and the Company acknowledge and agree to abide by the following:\n- If you are seeking to recover less than $10,000 (inclusive of attorneys' fees), Company will pay the filing fee on your behalf or reimburse your payment of it.\n- If you are seeking to recover $10,000 or more, you will have to pay the filing fee charged by JAMS, but Company will reimburse the filing fee if you prevail on all claims decided upon by the arbitrator.\n- Company and you agree that, if the claims to be arbitrated total less than $10,000 (inclusive of attorneys' fees), the claim ordinarily should be decided on written submissions only, without a telephonic or in-person hearing. Company will not request a hearing for any claims totaling less than $10,000. This provision shall not be construed by the arbitrator to deprive you of any rights you may have to a telephonic or in-person hearing in your hometown area pursuant to the JAMS Rules.\n- Company and you agree that, if the claims to be arbitrated total $10,000 or more, the arbitration will occur in a manner and place consistent with the JAMS Rules.\n(7) Regardless of how the arbitration proceeds, each of you and Company shall cooperate in good faith in the exchange of non-privileged documents and information as necessary in accordance with the JAMS Rules, and the arbitrator shall issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain his or her findings and conclusions.\n(8) Each of you and Company may incur attorneys' fees during the arbitration. Each side agrees to pay his, her or its own attorneys' fees unless the claim(s) at issue permit the prevailing party to be paid its attorneys' fees, and in such instance, the fees awarded shall be determined by the applicable law(s). In addition to whatever rights you may have to recover your attorneys' fees under applicable law, if you prevail in the arbitration, and if Company failed to make a settlement offer to you before the arbitration or the amount you win is at least 25% greater than Company's highest settlement offer, then Company will pay your reasonable attorneys' fees in addition to the amount the arbitrator awarded. If Company wins the arbitration, you will be responsible for your own attorneys' fees. In addition, if the arbitrator, at the request of the winning party, finds that the losing party brought a claim or asserted a defense frivolously or for an improper purpose, then regardless of the amount in dispute, the arbitrator must order the losing party to pay both sides' arbitration fees and may order the losing party to pay the winning party's reasonable attorneys' fees, unless such an award of fees is prohibited by applicable law.\n(9) The arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party's individual claim. The arbitrator may not order Company to pay any monies to or take any actions with respect to persons other than you, unless Company explicitly consents in advance, after an arbitrator is selected, to permit the arbitrator to enter such an order. Further, unless Company expressly agrees, the arbitrator may not consolidate other persons' claims with yours, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative, multi-claimant or class proceeding.\n(10) You and Company agree to maintain the confidential nature of the arbitration proceeding and shall not disclose the fact of the arbitration, any documents exchanged as part of any mediation, proceedings of the arbitration, the arbitrator's decision and the existence or amount of any award, except as may be necessary to prepare for or conduct the arbitration (in which case anyone becoming privy to confidential information must undertake to preserve its confidentiality), or except as may be necessary in connection with a court application for a provisional remedy, a judicial challenge to an award or its enforcement, or unless otherwise required by law or court order.\n(11) With the exception of subpart (a) in paragraph (5) (i.e., the waiver of the ability to proceed on behalf of multiple claimants or a purported class), if any part of this Arbitration Agreement is deemed invalid, unenforceable, or illegal, then the balance of this Arbitration Agreement shall remain in effect and be construed in accordance with its terms as if the invalid, unenforceable, or illegal provision were not contained. If, however, subpart (a) in paragraph (5) is found invalid, unenforceable or illegal, then the entirety of this Arbitration Agreement shall be null and void, but the rest of this Agreement, including the provisions governing where actions against Company must be pursued, the choice of governing law, and our mutual waiver of the right to a trial by jury, will remain in effect and apply to any claim that, for this or any other reason, proceeds in court rather than in arbitration.\nGoverning Law\nThe Agreement will be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of New York, without regard to its conflict of law provisions.\nExcept with respect to Disputes to be resolved through an arbitration process in accordance with the Arbitration Agreement contained above, you and Company agree to submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts located in New York, New York to resolve any Dispute arising out of the Agreement or the Company Services. YOU HEREBY KNOWINGLY, VOLUNTARILY AND INTENTIONALLY WAIVE ANY RIGHT YOU MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LITIGATION (INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, ANY CLAIMS, COUNTERCLAIMS, CROSS-CLAIMS, OR THIRD PARTY CLAIMS) ARISING OUT OF, UNDER OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT.\nSUBJECT TO APPLICABLE LAW, YOU AGREE THAT ANY CAUSE OF ACTION YOU MAY HAVE ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT, THE COMPANY SITES OR THE COMPANY SERVICES MUST BE COMMENCED WITHIN ONE (1) YEAR AFTER SUCH CAUSE OF ACTION ACCRUES. AFTER SUCH PERIOD, SUCH CAUSE OF ACTION SHALL BE PERMANENTLY BARRED.\nIndemnity\nYou agree to indemnify and hold Company, its Company Affiliates, subcontractors and other partners, and their respective officers, agents, partners and employees, harmless from any loss, liability, claim, or demand, including, but not limited to, reasonable attorneys' fees, made by any third party due to or arising out of or in connection with YOUR BREACH OF YOUR REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES, COVENANTS OR AGREEMENTS HEREUNDER; YOUR VIOLATION OF THIS AGREEMENT OF USE OR ANY APPLICABLE LAW; YOUR USE OF THE COMPANY SERVICES AND/OR THE CONTENT IN VIOLATION OF THIS AGREEMENT; INFORMATION OR CONTENT POSTED OR TRANSMITTED THROUGH YOUR AUTHORIZED DEVICE OR ACCOUNT, EVEN IF NOT SUBMITTED BY YOU, THAT INFRINGES ANY COPYRIGHT, TRADEMARK, TRADE SECRET, TRADE DRESS, PATENT, PUBLICITY, PRIVACY OR OTHER RIGHT OF ANY PERSON OR ENTITY OR DEFAMES ANY PERSON OR ENTITY; AND ANY MISREPRESENTATION MADE BY YOU.

Each of you and Company agrees to give up the right to sue in court. The term \"Dispute\" is to be given the broadest possible meaning that will be enforced, and shall include any dispute, claim, demand, count, cause of action, or controversy between you and Company, whether based in contract, statute, regulation, ordinance, tort (including, but not limited to, fraud, misrepresentation, fraudulent inducement, negligence, or any other intentional tort), or any other legal or equitable theory. The term \"Dispute\" specifically includes, but is not limited to, any and all claims between you and Company in any way related to or concerning this Arbitration Agreement, any other aspect of these Terms of Use (including their applicability and their conformance to applicable law), any products or services provided by Company, any billing disputes, and any disputes relating to telephonic, text message, or any other communications either of us received from the other. The only exceptions to this Arbitration Agreement are that (i) each of you and Company retains the right to sue in small claims court and (ii) each of you and Company may bring suit in court against the other to enjoin infringement or other misuse of intellectual property rights. Disputes over whether these exceptions apply shall be resolved by the court in which such action has been brought; all other disputes over arbitrability shall be resolved by the arbitrator. Each of you and Company also agrees to give up the ability to seek to represent, in a class action or otherwise, anyone but each of you and Company (see paragraph 9 below). There is no judge or jury in arbitration, and court review of an arbitration award is limited. An arbitrator must follow this Agreement. The arbitrator, however, can award on an individual basis the same damages and relief as a court (including injunctive and declaratory relief, or statutory damages).\n(2) This Agreement evidences a transaction in interstate commerce, and thus the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1-16, governs the interpretation and enforcement of this Arbitration Agreement. This Arbitration Agreement shall survive termination of this Agreement.\n(3) Any arbitration between you and Company will be conducted by the Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Services, Inc. (\"JAMS\"), pursuant to the JAMS Streamlined Arbitration Rules & Procedures effective July 1, 2014 (the \"JAMS Rules\"), as modified by this agreement to arbitrate. The arbitration shall be conducted by a single, neutral arbitrator, and if you and Company cannot agree on who that single arbitrator will be, the arbitrator will be appointed pursuant to the JAMS Rules, with the participation and involvement of Company and you pursuant to JAMS Rule 12. The JAMS Rules are available on its website at https://www.jamsadr.com/rules-streamlined-arbitration/ . The Consumer Arbitration Minimum Standards are available at https://www.jamsadr.com/rules-streamlined-arbitration/. The arbitrator is bound by the terms of this Agreement.\n(4) If either you or Company wants to arbitrate a claim, you or Company must first send by mail to the other a written Notice of Dispute (\"Notice\") that sets forth the name, address, and contact information of the party giving notice, the specific facts giving rise to the Dispute, the Company Service to which the Notice relates, and the relief requested. Your Notice to the Company must be sent by mail to Arbitration Notice of Dispute, 2121 Avenue of the Stars, 7th Floor, Los Angeles, California, 90067. The Company will send any Notice to you at the contact information we have for you or that you provide. It is the sender's responsibility to ensure that the recipient receives the Notice. During the first 45 days after you or we send a Notice to the other, you and we may try to reach a settlement of the Dispute.\nIf you and we do not resolve the Dispute within 45 days, either you or we may initiate arbitration in accordance with the JAMS Rules. Further instructions on submitting a Demand for Arbitration may be found at www.jamsadr.com/files/Uploads/Documents/JAMS_Arbitration_Demand.pdf. In addition to filing this Demand for Arbitration with JAMS in accordance with its rules and procedures, you must send a copy of this completed Demand for Arbitration to the Company at the address listed above to which you sent your Notice of Dispute.\n(5) You and the Company acknowledge and agree to abide by the following rules for arbitration: (a) YOU AND COMPANY MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS, REPRESENTATIVE OR MULTI-CLAIMANT PROCEEDING, AND THE ARBITRATOR SHALL HAVE NO POWER TO AWARD CLASS-WIDE RELIEF; (b) the Company will pay arbitration costs as required by the JAMS Consumer Arbitration Minimum Standards and consistent with paragraph 6 below; (c) the arbitrator may award any individual relief or individual remedies that are permitted by applicable law; and (d) each side pays his, her or its own attorneys' fees, except as otherwise provided in paragraph 8 below.\n(6) JAMS charges filing and other fees to conduct arbitrations. Ordinarily, the claimant has to pay the filing fee to initiate arbitration, but if you wish to commence an arbitration against Company, you and the Company acknowledge and agree to abide by the following:\n- If you are seeking to recover less than $10,000 (inclusive of attorneys' fees), Company will pay the filing fee on your behalf or reimburse your payment of it.\n- If you are seeking to recover $10,000 or more, you will have to pay the filing fee charged by JAMS, but Company will reimburse the filing fee if you prevail on all claims decided upon by the arbitrator.\n- Company and you agree that, if the claims to be arbitrated total less than $10,000 (inclusive of attorneys' fees), the claim ordinarily should be decided on written submissions only, without a telephonic or in-person hearing. Company will not request a hearing for any claims totaling less than $10,000. This provision shall not be construed by the arbitrator to deprive you of any rights you may have to a telephonic or in-person hearing in your hometown area pursuant to the JAMS Rules.\n- Company and you agree that, if the claims to be arbitrated total $10,000 or more, the arbitration will occur in a manner and place consistent with the JAMS Rules.\n(7) Regardless of how the arbitration proceeds, each of you and Company shall cooperate in good faith in the exchange of non-privileged documents and information as necessary in accordance with the JAMS Rules, and the arbitrator shall issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain his or her findings and conclusions.\n(8) Each of you and Company may incur attorneys' fees during the arbitration. Each side agrees to pay his, her or its own attorneys' fees unless the claim(s) at issue permit the prevailing party to be paid its attorneys' fees, and in such instance, the fees awarded shall be determined by the applicable law(s). In addition to whatever rights you may have to recover your attorneys' fees under applicable law, if you prevail in the arbitration, and if Company failed to make a settlement offer to you before the arbitration or the amount you win is at least 25% greater than Company's highest settlement offer, then Company will pay your reasonable attorneys' fees in addition to the amount the arbitrator awarded. If Company wins the arbitration, you will be responsible for your own attorneys' fees. In addition, if the arbitrator, at the request of the winning party, finds that the losing party brought a claim or asserted a defense frivolously or for an improper purpose, then regardless of the amount in dispute, the arbitrator must order the losing party to pay both sides' arbitration fees and may order the losing party to pay the winning party's reasonable attorneys' fees, unless such an award of fees is prohibited by applicable law.\n(9) The arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party's individual claim. The arbitrator may not order Company to pay any monies to or take any actions with respect to persons other than you, unless Company explicitly consents in advance, after an arbitrator is selected, to permit the arbitrator to enter such an order. Further, unless Company expressly agrees, the arbitrator may not consolidate other persons' claims with yours, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative, multi-claimant or class proceeding.\n(10) You and Company agree to maintain the confidential nature of the arbitration proceeding and shall not disclose the fact of the arbitration, any documents exchanged as part of any mediation, proceedings of the arbitration, the arbitrator's decision and the existence or amount of any award, except as may be necessary to prepare for or conduct the arbitration (in which case anyone becoming privy to confidential information must undertake to preserve its confidentiality), or except as may be necessary in connection with a court application for a provisional remedy, a judicial challenge to an award or its enforcement, or unless otherwise required by law or court order.\n(11) With the exception of subpart (a) in paragraph (5) (i.e., the waiver of the ability to proceed on behalf of multiple claimants or a purported class), if any part of this Arbitration Agreement is deemed invalid, unenforceable, or illegal, then the balance of this Arbitration Agreement shall remain in effect and be construed in accordance with its terms as if the invalid, unenforceable, or illegal provision were not contained. If, however, subpart (a) in paragraph (5) is found invalid, unenforceable or illegal, then the entirety of this Arbitration Agreement shall be null and void, but the rest of this Agreement, including the provisions governing where actions against Company must be pursued, the choice of governing law, and our mutual waiver of the right to a trial by jury, will remain in effect and apply to any claim that, for this or any other reason, proceeds in court rather than in arbitration.\nGoverning Law\nThe Agreement will be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of New York, without regard to its conflict of law provisions.\nExcept with respect to Disputes to be resolved through an arbitration process in accordance with the Arbitration Agreement contained above, you and Company agree to submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts located in New York, New York to resolve any Dispute arising out of the Agreement or the Company Services. YOU HEREBY KNOWINGLY, VOLUNTARILY AND INTENTIONALLY WAIVE ANY RIGHT YOU MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LITIGATION (INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, ANY CLAIMS, COUNTERCLAIMS, CROSS-CLAIMS, OR THIRD PARTY CLAIMS) ARISING OUT OF, UNDER OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT.\nSUBJECT TO APPLICABLE LAW, YOU AGREE THAT ANY CAUSE OF ACTION YOU MAY HAVE ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT, THE COMPANY SITES OR THE COMPANY SERVICES MUST BE COMMENCED WITHIN ONE (1) YEAR AFTER SUCH CAUSE OF ACTION ACCRUES. AFTER SUCH PERIOD, SUCH CAUSE OF ACTION SHALL BE PERMANENTLY BARRED.\nIndemnity\nYou agree to indemnify and hold Company, its Company Affiliates, subcontractors and other partners, and their respective officers, agents, partners and employees, harmless from any loss, liability, claim, or demand, including, but not limited to, reasonable attorneys' fees, made by any third party due to or arising out of or in connection with YOUR BREACH OF YOUR REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES, COVENANTS OR AGREEMENTS HEREUNDER; YOUR VIOLATION OF THIS AGREEMENT OF USE OR ANY APPLICABLE LAW; YOUR USE OF THE COMPANY SERVICES AND/OR THE CONTENT IN VIOLATION OF THIS AGREEMENT; INFORMATION OR CONTENT POSTED OR TRANSMITTED THROUGH YOUR AUTHORIZED DEVICE OR ACCOUNT, EVEN IF NOT SUBMITTED BY YOU, THAT INFRINGES ANY COPYRIGHT, TRADEMARK, TRADE SECRET, TRADE DRESS, PATENT, PUBLICITY, PRIVACY OR OTHER RIGHT OF ANY PERSON OR ENTITY OR DEFAMES ANY PERSON OR ENTITY; AND ANY MISREPRESENTATION MADE BY YOU. YOU WILL COOPERATE AS FULLY AND AS REASONABLY REQUIRED IN COMPANY\u2019S DEFENSE OF ANY CLAIM. COMPANY RESERVES THE RIGHT, AT ITS OWN EXPENSE, TO ASSUME THE EXCLUSIVE DEFENSE AND CONTROL OF ANY MATTER OTHERWISE SUBJECT TO INDEMNIFICATION BY YOU, AND YOU SHALL NOT IN ANY EVENT SETTLE ANY SUCH MATTER WITHOUT THE WRITTEN CONSENT OF COMPANY.\nUnsolicited Submissions\nCompany does not knowingly accept, via the Company Services or otherwise, unsolicited submissions including, without limitation, submissions by you of blog ideas, articles, scripts, story lines, fan fiction, characters, drawings, information, suggestions, proposals, ideas or concepts. Company requests that you do not make any unsolicited submissions.

If you choose to submit your name, contact information, resume and/or other personal information to Company in response to employment listings, you are authorizing Company to utilize this information for all lawful and legitimate hiring and employment purposes.

In addition, you may not construe a waiver of any provision of this Agreement with respect to any party as a waiver of that provision (or any other provision) with respect to either that party or any other party.

We use common internet technologies, such as cookies and web server logs. This is stuff we collect from everybody, whether they have an account or not.\nThe information we collect about all visitors to our website includes the visitor\u2019s browser type, language preference, referring site, additional websites requested, and the date and time of each visitor request. We also collect potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses.\nWhy we collect this information\nWe collect this information to better understand how our website visitors use GitHub, and to monitor and protect the security of the website.\nInformation from users with accounts\nIf you create an account, we require some basic information at the time of account creation. You will create your own user name and password, and we will ask you for a valid email address. You also have the option to give us more information if you want to, and this may include \"User Personal Information.\"\n\"User Personal Information\" is any information about one of our users which could, alone or together with other information, personally identify him or her. Information such as a user name and password, an email address, a real name, and a photograph are examples of \u201cUser Personal Information.\u201d User Personal Information includes Personal Data as defined in the General Data Protection Regulation.\nUser Personal Information does not include aggregated, non-personally identifying information. We may use aggregated, non-personally identifying information to operate, improve, and optimize our website and service.\nWhy we collect this information\n---We need your User Personal Information to create your account, and to provide the services you request, including to provide the GitHub service, the Marketplace service, or to respond to support requests.\n---We use your User Personal Information, specifically your user name, to identify you on GitHub.\n---We use it to fill out your profile and share that profile with other users if you ask us to.\n---We will use your email address to communicate with you, if you&aposve said that&aposs okay, and only for the reasons you\u2019ve said that\u2019s okay. Please see our section on email communication for more information.\n---We use User Personal Information and other data to make recommendations for you, such as to suggest projects you may want to follow or contribute to. For example, when you fill out an interest survey at account creation, we learn from it \u2014 as well as from your public behavior on GitHub, such as the projects you star \u2014 to determine your coding interests, and we recommend similar projects. These recommendations are automated decisions, but they have no legal impact on your rights.\n---We use your User Personal Information for internal purposes, such as to maintain logs for security reasons, for training purposes, and for legal documentation.\n---We limit our use of your User Personal Information to the purposes listed in this Privacy Statement. If we need to use your User Personal Information for other purposes, we will ask your permission first. You can always see what information we have, how we&aposre using it, and what permissions you have given us in your user profile.\nOur legal basis for processing information\nUnder certain international laws (including GDPR), GitHub is required to notify you about the legal basis on which we process User Personal Information. GitHub processes User Personal Information on the following legal bases:\n---When you create a GitHub account, you provide your user name and an email address. We require those data elements for you to enter into the Terms of Service agreement with us, and we process those elements on the basis of performing that contract. We also process your user name and email address on other bases. If you have a GitHub Enterprise Cloud, GitHub Enterprise Server, or other paid account with us, there will be other data elements we must collect and process on the basis of performing that contract. GitHub does not collect or process a credit card number, but our third-party payment processor does.\n---When you fill out the information in your user profile, you have the option to provide User Personal Information such as your full name, an avatar which may include a photograph, your biography, your location, your company, and a URL to a third party website. You have the option of setting a publicly visible email address here. We process this information on the basis of consent. All of this information is entirely optional, and you have the ability to access, modify, and delete it at any time (while you are not able to delete your email address entirely, you can make it private).\n---Generally, the remainder of the processing of personal information we perform is necessary for the purposes of our legitimate interests. For example, for security purposes, we must keep logs of IP addresses that access GitHub, and in order to respond to legal process, we are required to keep records of users who have sent and received DMCA takedown notices.\n---If you would like to request erasure of data we process on the basis of consent or object to our processing of personal information, please use our Privacy contact form.\nWe do not intentionally collect sensitive personal information, such as social security numbers, genetic data, health information, or religious information. Although GitHub does not request or intentionally collect any sensitive personal information, we realize that you might store this kind of information in your account, such as in a repository or in your public profile. If you store any sensitive personal information on our servers, you are responsible for complying with any regulatory controls regarding that data.\nIf you&aposre a child under the age of 13, you may not have an account on GitHub. GitHub does not knowingly collect information from or direct any of our content specifically to children under 13. If we learn or have reason to suspect that you are a user who is under the age of 13, we will unfortunately have to close your account. We don&apost want to discourage you from learning to code, but those are the rules. Please see our Terms of Service for information about account termination. Other countries may have different minimum age limits, and if you are below the minimum age for providing consent for data collection in your country, you may not use GitHub without obtaining your parents&apos or legal guardians&apos consent.\nWe do not intentionally collect User Personal Information that is stored in your repositories or other free-form content inputs. Information in your repositories belongs to you, and you are responsible for it, as well as for making sure that your content complies with our Terms of Service. Any personal information within a user&aposs repository is the responsibility of the repository owner.\nRepository contents\nGitHub employees do not access private repositories unless required to for security reasons, to assist the repository owner with a support matter, or to maintain the integrity of the service. Our Terms of Service provides more details.\nIf your repository is public, anyone (including us and unaffiliated third parties) may view its contents. If you have included private or sensitive information in your public repository, such as email addresses or passwords, that information may be indexed by search engines or used by third parties. In addition, while we do not generally search for content in your repositories, we may scan our servers for certain tokens or security signatures, or for known active malware.\nPlease see more about User Personal Information in public repositories.\nWe do share User Personal Information with your permission, so we can perform services you have requested or communicate on your behalf. For example, if you purchase an integration or other Developer Product from our Marketplace, we will share your account name to allow the integrator to provide you services. Additionally, you may indicate, through your actions on GitHub, that you are willing to share your User Personal Information. For example, if you join an organization, the owner of the organization will have the ability to view your activity in the organization&aposs access log. We will respect your choices.\nWe do not share, sell, rent, or trade User Personal Information with third parties for their commercial purposes, except where you have specifically told us to (such as by buying an integration from Marketplace).\nWe do not host advertising on GitHub. We may occasionally embed content from third party sites, such as YouTube, and that content may include ads. While we try to minimize the amount of ads our embedded content contains, we can&apost always control what third parties show. Any advertisements on individual GitHub Pages or in GitHub repositories are not sponsored by, or tracked by, GitHub.\nWe do not disclose User Personal Information outside GitHub, except in the situations listed in this section or in the section below on Compelled Disclosure.\nWe do share certain aggregated, non-personally identifying information with others about how our users, collectively, use GitHub, or how our users respond to our other offerings, such as our conferences or events. For example, we may compile statistics on the usage of open source licenses across GitHub. However, we do not sell this information to advertisers or marketers.\nWe do share User Personal Information with a limited number of third party vendors who process it on our behalf to provide or improve our service, and who have agreed to privacy restrictions similar to our own Privacy Statement by signing data protection agreements. Our vendors perform services such as payment processing, customer support ticketing, network data transmission, and other similar services. When we transfer your data to our vendors under EU-US Privacy Shield Framework, we remain responsible for it. While GitHub processes all User Personal Information in the United States, our third party vendors may process data outside of the United States or the European Union. If you would like to know who our third party vendors are, please see our page on Subprocessors.\nWe do share aggregated, non-personally identifying information with third parties. For example, we share the number of stars on a repository, or in the event of a security incident, we may share the number of times a particular file was accessed.\nWe may share User Personal Information if we are involved in a merger, sale, or acquisition. If any such change of ownership happens, we will ensure that it is under terms that preserve the confidentiality of User Personal Information, and we will notify you on our website or by email before any transfer of your User Personal Information. The organization receiving any User Personal Information will have to honor any promises we have made in our Privacy Statement or in our Terms of Service.\nPublic information on GitHub\nMuch of GitHub is public-facing. If your content is public-facing, third parties may access and use it in compliance with our Terms of Service, such as by viewing your profile or repositories or pulling data via our API. We do not sell that content; it is yours. However, we do allow third parties, such as research organizations or archives, to compile public-facing GitHub information. Other third parties, such as data brokers, have been known to scrape GitHub and compile data as well.\nYour Personal Information, associated with your content, could be gathered by third parties in these compilations of GitHub data. If you do not want your Personal Information to appear in third parties\u2019 compilations of GitHub data, please do not make your Personal Information publicly available and be sure to configure your email address to be private in your user profile and in your git commit settings. We currently set users&apos email address private by default, but legacy GitHub users may need to update their settings.\nIf you would like to compile GitHub data, you must comply with our Terms of Service regarding scraping and privacy, and you may only use any public-facing Personal Information you gather for the purpose for which our user has authorized it. For example, where a GitHub user has made an email address public-facing for the purpose of identification and attribution, do not use that email address for commercial advertising. We expect you to reasonably secure any Personal Information you have gathered from GitHub, and to respond promptly to complaints, removal requests, and \"do not contact\" requests from GitHub or GitHub users.\nSimilarly, projects on GitHub may include publicly available Personal Information collected as part of the collaborative process. In the event that a GitHub project contains publicly available Personal Information that does not belong to GitHub users, we will only use that Personal Information for the limited purpose for which it was collected, and we will secure that Personal Information as we would secure any User Personal Information. If you have a complaint about any Personal Information on GitHub, please see our section on resolving complaints.\nThird party applications\nYou have the option of enabling or adding third party applications, known as \"Developer Products,\" to your account. These Developer Products are not necessary for your use of GitHub. We will share your User Personal Information to third parties when you ask us to, such as by purchasing a Developer Product from the Marketplace; however, you are responsible for your use of the third party Developer Product and for the amount of User Personal Information you choose to share with it. You can check our API documentation to see what information is provided when you authenticate into a Developer Product using your GitHub profile.\nGitHub applications\nYou also have the option of adding applications from GitHub, such as our Desktop app, our Electron or Atom applications, or other account features, to your account. These applications each have their own terms and may collect different kinds of User Personal Information; however, all GitHub applications are subject to this Privacy Statement, and we will always collect the minimum amount of User Personal Information necessary, and use it only for the purpose for which you have given it to us.\nIf you&aposre already a GitHub user, you may access, update, alter, or delete your basic user profile information by editing your user profile or contacting GitHub Support or GitHub Premium Support. You can control the information we collect about you by limiting what information is in your profile, by updating out of date information, or by contacting GitHub Support or GitHub Premium Support.\nData portability\nAs a GitHub User, you can always take your data with you. You can clone your repositories to your desktop, for example, or you can use our Data Portability tools to download all of the data we have about you.\nData retention and deletion of data\nGenerally, GitHub will retain User Personal Information for as long as your account is active or as needed to provide you services.\nWe may retain certain User Personal Information indefinitely, unless you delete it or request its deletion. For example, we don\u2019t automatically delete inactive user accounts, so unless you choose to delete your account, we will retain your account information indefinitely.\nIf you would like to cancel your account or delete your User Personal Information, you may do so in your user profile. We will retain and use your information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements, but barring legal requirements, we will delete your full profile (within reason) within 90 days. You may contact GitHub Support or GitHub Premium Support to request the erasure of the data we process on the basis of consent within 30 days.\nAfter an account has been deleted, certain data, such as contributions to others&apos repositories and comments in others&apos issues, will remain. However, we will delete or deidentify your personal information, including your user name and email address, from the author field of issues, pull requests, and comments by associating them with the ghost user.\nThe email address you have supplied via your Git commit settings will always be associated with your commits in the Git system. If you chose to make your email address private, you should also update your Git commit settings. We are unable to change or delete data in the Git commit history \u2014 the Git software is designed to maintain a record \u2014 but we do enable you to control what information you put in that record.\nCookies\nGitHub uses cookies to make interactions with our service easy and meaningful. We use cookies (and similar technologies, like HTML5 localStorage) to keep you logged in, remember your preferences, and provide information for future development of GitHub. We also use cookies to identify a device, for security reasons. By using our website, you agree that we can place these types of cookies on your computer or device. If you disable your browser or device\u2019s ability to accept cookies, you will not be able to log in or use GitHub\u2019s services.\nWe provide a web page on cookies and tracking that describes the cookies we set, the needs we have for those cookies, and the types of cookies they are (temporary or permanent). It also lists our third party analytics and service providers and details exactly which parts of our website we permit them to track.\nTracking and analytics\nWe use a number of third party analytics and service providers to help us evaluate our users&apos use of GitHub; compile statistical reports on activity; and improve our content and website performance. We only use these third party analytics providers on certain areas of our website, and all of them have signed data protection agreements with us that limit the type of personal information they can collect and the purpose for which they can process the information. In addition, we use our own internal analytics software to provide features and improve our content and performance.\nWe do not currently respond to your browser&aposs Do Not Track signal, and we do not permit third parties other than our analytics and service providers to track GitHub users&apos activity over time on GitHub. We do not track your online browsing activity on other online services over time.\nGitHub takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect User Personal Information from unauthorized access, alteration, or destruction; maintain data accuracy; and help ensure the appropriate use of User Personal Information.\nGitHub enforces a written security information program. Our program:\n---aligns with industry recognized frameworks;  \n---includes security safeguards reasonably designed to protect the confidentiality, integrity, availability, and resilience of our users&apos data;\n---is appropriate to the nature, size, and complexity of GitHub\u2019s business operations;\n---includes incident response and data breach notification processes; and\n---complies with applicable information security related laws and regulations in the geographic regions where GitHub does business.\nIn the event of a data breach that affects your User Personal Information, we will act promptly to mitigate the impact of a breach and notify any affected users without undue delay.\nTransmission of data on GitHub is encrypted using SSH, HTTPS, and SSL/TLS. While our data is not encrypted at rest, we manage our own cages and racks at top-tier data centers with excellent physical and network security, and when data is stored with a third party storage provider, it is encrypted.\nNo method of transmission, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure. Therefore, we cannot guarantee its absolute security. For more information, see our security disclosures.\nWe store and process the information that we collect in the United States in accordance with this Privacy Statement (our subprocessors may store and process data outside the United States). However, we understand that we have users from different countries and regions with different privacy expectations, and we try to meet those needs even when the United States does not have the same privacy framework as other countries&apos.\nWe provide the same standard of privacy protection \u2014 as described in this Privacy Statement \u2014 to all our users around the world, regardless of their country of origin or location, and we are proud of the levels of notice, choice, accountability, security, data integrity, access, and recourse we provide. We have appointed a Privacy Counsel and we work hard to comply with the applicable data privacy laws wherever we do business, and our Privacy Counsel also acts as our Data Protection Officer, part of a cross-functional team that oversees our privacy compliance efforts. Additionally, if our vendors or affiliates have access to User Personal Information, they must sign agreements that require them to comply with our privacy policies and with applicable data privacy laws.\nIn particular:\n---GitHub provides clear methods of unambiguous, informed consent at the time of data collection, when we do collect your personal data using consent as a basis.\n---We collect only the minimum amount of personal data necessary for our purposes, unless you choose to provide more. We encourage you to only give us the amount of data you are comfortable sharing.\n---We offer you simple methods of accessing, correcting, or deleting the User Personal Information we have collected.\n---We provide our users notice, choice, accountability, security, and access, and we limit the purpose for processing. We also provide our users a method of recourse and enforcement. These are the Privacy Shield Principles, but they are also just good practices.\nCross-border data transfers\nFor cross-border data transfers from the EU, the European Economic Area (EEA), Switzerland, and UK, GitHub adheres to the Privacy Shield Principles. You may view our EU-US certification entry in the Privacy Shield List.\nIn addition to providing our users methods of unambiguous, informed consent and control over their data, we participate in and comply with the EU-US Privacy Shield Framework, and we are committed to subject any personal information we receive from the EU, EEA, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom to the Privacy Shield Principles.\nGitHub may disclose personally-identifying information or other information we collect about you to law enforcement in response to a valid subpoena, court order, warrant, or similar government order, or when we believe in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect our property or rights, or those of third parties or the public at large.\nIn complying with court orders and similar legal processes, GitHub strives for transparency. When permitted, we will make a reasonable effort to notify users of any disclosure of their information, unless we are prohibited by law or court order from doing so, or in rare, exigent circumstances.\nFor more information, see our Guidelines for Legal Requests of User Data.\nWe will use your email address to communicate with you, if you&aposve said that&aposs okay, and only for the reasons you\u2019ve said that\u2019s okay. For example, if you contact our Support team with a request, we will respond to you via email. You have a lot of control over how your email address is used and shared on and through GitHub. You may manage your communication preferences in your user profile.\nBy design, the Git version control system associates many actions with a user&aposs email address, such as commit messages. We are not able to change many aspects of the Git system. If you would like your email address to remain private, even when you\u2019re commenting on public repositories, you can create a private email address in your user profile. You should also update your local Git configuration to use your private email address. This will not change how we contact you, but it will affect how others see you. We set current users&apos email address private by default, but legacy GitHub users may need to update their settings. Please see more about email addresses in commit messages here.\nDepending on your email settings, GitHub may occasionally send notification emails about changes in a repository you\u2019re watching, new features, requests for feedback, important policy changes, or offer customer support. We also send marketing emails, but only with your consent, if you opt in to our list. There&aposs an unsubscribe link located at the bottom of each of the marketing emails we send you. Please note that you can not opt out of receiving important communications from us, such as mails from our Support team or system emails, but you can configure your notifications settings in your profile.\nOur emails might contain a pixel tag, which is a small, clear image that can tell us whether or not you have opened an email and what your IP address is. We use this pixel tag to make our email more effective for you and to make sure we\u2019re not sending you unwanted email.\nIf you have concerns about the way GitHub is handling your User Personal Information, please let us know immediately. We want to help. You may contact us by filling out the Privacy contact form. You may also email us directly at privacy@github.com with the subject line \"Privacy Concerns.\" We will respond promptly \u2014 within 45 days at the latest.\nYou may also contact our Data Protection Officer directly.\nOur United States HQ\nOur EU Office\nGitHub Data Protection Officer\nGitHub BV\n88 Colin P. Kelly Jr. St.\nVijzelstraat 68-72\nSan Francisco, CA 94107\n1017 HL Amsterdam\nUnited States\nThe Netherlands\nprivacy@github.com\nprivacy@github.com\nDispute resolution process\nIn the unlikely event that a dispute arises between you and GitHub regarding our handling of your User Personal Information, we will do our best to resolve it. If we cannot, we have selected JAMS, an independent dispute resolution provider, to handle unresolved Privacy Shield complaints. If we are unable to resolve your concerns after a good faith effort to address them, you may contact JAMS and submit a Privacy Shield claim. JAMS is a US-based private alternate dispute resolution provider, and we have contracted with JAMS to provide an independent recourse mechanism for any of our users for privacy concerns at no cost to you. You do not need to appear in court; you may conduct this dispute resolution process via telephone or video conference. If you are not based in the EU, EEA, Switzerland, or the UK, but you would still like to use the JAMS arbitration process to resolve your dispute, please let us know and we will provide access to you.\nAdditionally, if you are a resident of an EU member state, you have the right to file a complaint with your local supervisory authority.\nIndependent arbitration\nUnder certain limited circumstances, EU, EEA, Swiss, and UK individuals may invoke binding Privacy Shield arbitration as a last resort if all other forms of dispute resolution have been unsuccessful. To learn more about this method of resolution and its availability to you, please read more about Privacy Shield. Arbitration is not mandatory; it is a tool you can use if you choose to.\nWe are subject to the jurisdiction of the Federal Trade Commission.\nAlthough most changes are likely to be minor, GitHub may change our Privacy Statement from time to time. We will provide notification to Users of material changes to this Privacy Statement through our Website at least 30 days prior to the change taking effect by posting a notice on our home page or sending email to the primary email address specified in your GitHub account. We will also update our Site Policy repository, which tracks all changes to this policy. For changes to this Privacy Statement that do not affect your rights, we encourage visitors to check our Site Policy repository frequently.\nThis Privacy Statement is licensed under this Creative Commons Zero license.

You should know what we mean when we use each of the terms. There&aposs not going to be a test on it, but it&aposs still useful information.\n---The \u201cAgreement\u201d refers, collectively, to all the terms, conditions, notices contained or referenced in this document (the \u201cTerms of Service\u201d or the \"Terms\") and all other operating rules, policies (including the GitHub Privacy Statement, available at github.com/site/privacy) and procedures that we may publish from time to time on the Website.

These Terms also govern GitHub\u2019s conference websites, such as githubuniverse.com, and product websites, such as atom.io. Occasionally, websites owned by GitHub may provide different or additional terms of service. If those additional terms conflict with this Agreement, the more specific terms apply to the relevant page or service.\n---\u201cThe User,\u201d \u201cYou,\u201d and \u201cYour\u201d refer to the individual person, company, or organization that has visited or is using the Website or Service; that accesses or uses any part of the Account; or that directs the use of the Account in the performance of its functions.

A \u201cUser Account\u201d represents an individual User\u2019s authorization to log in to and use the Service and serves as a User\u2019s identity on GitHub. \u201cOrganizations\u201d are shared workspaces that may be associated with a single entity or with one or more Users where multiple Users can collaborate across many projects at once. A User Account can be a member of any number of Organizations.\nShort version: User Accounts and Organizations have different administrative controls; a human must create your Account; you must be 13 or over; you must provide a valid email address; and you may not have more than one free Account. You alone are responsible for your Account and anything that happens while you are signed in to or using your Account. You are responsible for keeping your Account secure.\n1. Account Controls\n---\nUsers. Subject to these Terms, you retain ultimate administrative control over your User Account and the Content within it.\n---\nOrganizations. The \"owner\" of an Organization that was created under these Terms has ultimate administrative control over that Organization and the Content within it. Within the Service, an owner can manage User access to the Organization\u2019s data and projects. An Organization may have multiple owners, but there must be at least one User Account designated as an owner of an Organization. If you are the owner of an Organization under these Terms, we consider you responsible for the actions that are performed on or through that Organization.\n2. Required Information\nYou must provide a valid email address in order to complete the signup process. Any other information requested, such as your real name, is optional, unless you are accepting these terms on behalf of a legal entity (in which case we need more information about the legal entity) or if you opt for a paid Account, in which case additional information will be necessary for billing purposes.\n3. Account Requirements\nWe have a few simple rules for User Accounts on GitHub&aposs Service.\n---You must be a human to create an Account. Accounts registered by \"bots\" or other automated methods are not permitted. We do permit machine accounts:  \n---A machine account is an Account set up by an individual human who accepts the Terms on behalf of the Account, provides a valid email address, and is responsible for its actions. A machine account is used exclusively for performing automated tasks. Multiple users may direct the actions of a machine account, but the owner of the Account is ultimately responsible for the machine&aposs actions. You may maintain no more than one free machine account in addition to your free User Account.\n---One person or legal entity may maintain no more than one free Account (if you choose to control a machine account as well, that&aposs fine, but it can only be used for running a machine).\n---You must be age 13 or older. While we are thrilled to see brilliant young coders get excited by learning to program, we must comply with United States law. GitHub does not target our Service to children under 13, and we do not permit any Users under 13 on our Service. If we learn of any User under the age of 13, we will terminate that User\u2019s Account immediately. If you are a resident of a country outside the United States, your country\u2019s minimum age may be older; in such a case, you are responsible for complying with your country\u2019s laws.\n---Your login may only be used by one person \u2014 i.e., a single login may not be shared by multiple people. A paid Organization  may only provide access to as many User Accounts as your subscription allows.\n4. User Account Security\nYou are responsible for keeping your Account secure while you use our Service. We offer tools such as two-factor authentication to help you maintain your Account&aposs security, but the content of your Account and its security are up to you.\n---You are responsible for all content posted and activity that occurs under your Account (even when content is posted by others who have Accounts under your Account).\n---You are responsible for maintaining the security of your Account and password. GitHub cannot and will not be liable for any loss or damage from your failure to comply with this security obligation.\n---You will promptly notify GitHub if you become aware of any unauthorized use of, or access to, our Service through your Account, including any unauthorized use of your password or Account.\n5. Additional Terms\nIn some situations, third parties&apos terms may apply to your use of GitHub. For example, you may be a member of an organization on GitHub with its own terms or license agreements; you may download an application that integrates with GitHub; or you may use GitHub to authenticate to another service. Please be aware that while these Terms are our full agreement with you, other parties&apos terms govern their relationships with you.\nIf you are a government User or otherwise accessing or using any GitHub Service in a government capacity, this Government Amendment to GitHub Terms of Service applies to you, and you agree to its provisions.\nIf you have signed up for GitHub Enterprise Cloud, the Enterprise Cloud Addendum applies to you, and you agree to its provisions.\nShort version: GitHub hosts a wide variety of collaborative projects from all over the world, and that collaboration only works when our users are able to work together in good faith. While using the service, you must follow this Acceptable Use Policy, which includes some restrictions on content you can post, conduct on the service, and other limitations. In short, be excellent to each other.\n1. Compliance with Laws and Regulations\nYour use of the Website and Service must not violate any applicable laws, including copyright or trademark laws, export control laws, or other laws in your jurisdiction. You are responsible for making sure that your use of the Service is in compliance with laws and any applicable regulations.\n2. Content Restrictions\nYou agree that you will not under any circumstances upload, post, host, or transmit any content that:\n---is unlawful or promotes unlawful activities;\n---is or contains sexually obscene content;\n---is libelous, defamatory, or fraudulent;\n---is discriminatory or abusive toward any individual or group;\n---contains or installs any active malware or exploits, or uses our platform for exploit delivery (such as part of a command and control system); or\n---infringes on any proprietary right of any party, including patent, trademark, trade secret, copyright, right of publicity, or other rights.\n3. Conduct Restrictions\nWhile using GitHub, you agree that you will not under any circumstances:\n---harass, abuse, threaten, or incite violence towards any individual or group, including GitHub employees, officers, and agents, or other GitHub Users;\n---use our servers for any form of excessive automated bulk activity (for example, spamming), or relay any other form of unsolicited advertising or solicitation through our servers, such as get-rich-quick schemes;\n---attempt to disrupt or tamper with GitHub&aposs servers in ways that could harm our Website or Service, to place undue burden on GitHub&aposs servers through automated means, or to access GitHub&aposs Service in ways that exceed your authorization (other than those authorized by the GitHub Bug Bounty program);\n---impersonate any person or entity, including any of our employees or representatives, including through false association with GitHub, or by fraudulently misrepresenting your identity or site&aposs purpose; or\n---violate the privacy of any third party, such as by posting another person&aposs personal information without consent.\n4. Services Usage Limits\nYou agree not to reproduce, duplicate, copy, sell, resell or exploit any portion of the Service, use of the Service, or access to the Service without GitHub&aposs express written permission.\n5. Scraping\nScraping refers to extracting data from our Website via an automated process, such as a bot or webcrawler. It does not refer to the collection of information through GitHub&aposs API. Please see Section H for our API Terms. You may scrape the website for the following reasons:\n---Researchers may scrape public, non-personal information from GitHub for research purposes, only if any publications resulting from that research are open access.\n---Archivists may scrape GitHub for public data for archival purposes.\nYou may not scrape GitHub for spamming purposes, including for the purposes of selling GitHub users&apos personal information, such as to recruiters, headhunters, and job boards.\nAll use of GitHub data gathered through scraping must comply with the GitHub Privacy Statement.\n6. Privacy\nMisuse of GitHub Users&apos Personal Information is prohibited.\nAny person, entity, or service collecting data from GitHub must comply with the GitHub Privacy Statement, particularly in regards to the collection of our Users&apos Personal Information (as defined in the GitHub Privacy Statement). If you collect any GitHub User&aposs Personal Information from GitHub, you agree that you will only use the Personal Information you gather for the purpose for which our User has authorized it. You agree that you will reasonably secure any Personal Information you have gathered from GitHub, and you will respond promptly to complaints, removal requests, and \"do not contact\" requests from GitHub or GitHub Users.\n7. Excessive Bandwidth Use\nIf we determine your bandwidth usage to be significantly excessive in relation to other GitHub customers, we reserve the right to suspend your Account or throttle your file hosting until you can reduce your bandwidth consumption.\n8. User Protection\nYou agree not to engage in activity that significantly harms our Users. We will resolve disputes in favor of protecting our Users as a whole.\nShort version: You own content you create, but you allow us certain rights to it, so that we can display and share the content you post. You still have control over your content, and responsibility for it, and the rights you grant us are limited to those we need to provide the service. We have the right to remove content or close Accounts if we need to.\n1. Responsibility for User-Generated Content\nYou may create or upload User-Generated Content while using the Service. You are solely responsible for the content of, and for any harm resulting from, any User-Generated Content that you post, upload, link to or otherwise make available via the Service, regardless of the form of that Content. We are not responsible for any public display or misuse of your User-Generated Content.\n2. GitHub May Remove Content\nWe do not pre-screen User-Generated Content, but we have the right (though not the obligation) to refuse or remove any User-Generated Content that, in our sole discretion, violates any GitHub terms or policies.\n3. Ownership of Content, Right to Post, and License Grants\nYou retain ownership of and responsibility for Your Content. If you&aposre posting anything you did not create yourself or do not own the rights to, you agree that you are responsible for any Content you post; that you will only submit Content that you have the right to post; and that you will fully comply with any third party licenses relating to Content you post.\nBecause you retain ownership of and responsibility for Your Content, we need you to grant us \u2014 and other GitHub Users \u2014 certain legal permissions, listed in Sections D.4 \u2014 D.7. These license grants apply to Your Content. If you upload Content that already comes with a license granting GitHub the permissions we need to run our Service, no additional license is required. You understand that you will not receive any payment for any of the rights granted in Sections D.4 \u2014 D.7. The licenses you grant to us will end when you remove Your Content from our servers, unless other Users have forked it.\n4. License Grant to Us\nWe need the legal right to do things like host Your Content, publish it, and share it. You grant us and our legal successors the right to store, parse, and display Your Content, and make incidental copies as necessary to render the Website and provide the Service. This includes the right to do things like copy it to our database and make backups; show it to you and other users; parse it into a search index or otherwise analyze it on our servers; share it with other users; and perform it, in case Your Content is something like music or video.\nThis license does not grant GitHub the right to sell Your Content or otherwise distribute or use it outside of our provision of the Service.\n5. License Grant to Other Users\nAny User-Generated Content you post publicly, including issues, comments, and contributions to other Users&apos repositories, may be viewed by others. By setting your repositories to be viewed publicly, you agree to allow others to view and \"fork\" your repositories (this means that others may make their own copies of Content from your repositories in repositories they control).\nIf you set your pages and repositories to be viewed publicly, you grant each User of GitHub a nonexclusive, worldwide license to use, display, and perform Your Content through the GitHub Service and to reproduce Your Content solely on GitHub as permitted through GitHub&aposs functionality (for example, through forking). You may grant further rights if you adopt a license. If you are uploading Content you did not create or own, you are responsible for ensuring that the Content you upload is licensed under terms that grant these permissions to other GitHub Users.\n6. Contributions Under Repository License\nWhenever you make a contribution to a repository containing notice of a license, you license your contribution under the same terms, and you agree that you have the right to license your contribution under those terms. If you have a separate agreement to license your contributions under different terms, such as a contributor license agreement, that agreement will supersede.\nIsn&apost this just how it works already? Yep. This is widely accepted as the norm in the open-source community; it&aposs commonly referred to by the shorthand \"inbound=outbound\". We&aposre just making it explicit.\n7. Moral Rights\nYou retain all moral rights to Your Content that you upload, publish, or submit to any part of the Service, including the rights of integrity and attribution. However, you waive these rights and agree not to assert them against us, to enable us to reasonably exercise the rights granted in Section D.4, but not otherwise.\nTo the extent this agreement is not enforceable by applicable law, you grant GitHub the rights we need to use Your Content without attribution and to make reasonable adaptations of Your Content as necessary to render the Website and provide the Service.\nShort version: You may have access to private repositories. We treat the content of private repositories as confidential, and we only access it for support reasons, with your consent, or if required to for security reasons.\n1. Control of Private Repositories.\nSome Accounts, such as paid Accounts, may have private repositories, which allow the User to control access to Content.\n2. Confidentiality of Private Repositories.\nGitHub considers the contents of private repositories to be confidential to you. GitHub will protect the contents of private repositories from unauthorized use, access, or disclosure in the same manner that we would use to protect our own confidential information of a similar nature and in no event with less than a reasonable degree of care.\n3. Access.\nGitHub employees may only access the content of your private repositories in the following situations:\n---With your consent and knowledge, for support reasons. If GitHub accesses a private repository for support reasons, we will only do so with the owner\u2019s consent and knowledge.\n---When access is required for security reasons, including when access is required to maintain ongoing confidentiality, integrity, availability and resilience of GitHub&aposs systems and Service.\nYou may choose to enable additional access to your private repositories. For example:\n---You may enable various GitHub services or features that require additional rights to Your Content in private repositories. These rights may vary depending on the service or feature, but GitHub will continue to treat your private repository Content as confidential. If those services or features require rights in addition to those we need to provide the GitHub Service, we will provide an explanation of those rights.\n4. Exclusions.\nIf we have reason to believe the contents of a private repository are in violation of the law or of these Terms, we have the right to access, review, and remove them. Additionally, we may be compelled by law to disclose the contents of your private repositories.\nIf you believe that content on our website violates your copyright, please contact us in accordance with our Digital Millennium Copyright Act Policy. If you are a copyright owner and you believe that content on GitHub violates your rights, please contact us via our convenient DMCA form or by emailing copyright@github.com. There may be legal consequences for sending a false or frivolous takedown notice. Before sending a takedown request, you must consider legal uses such as fair use and licensed uses.\nWe will terminate the Accounts of repeat infringers of this policy.\nShort version: We own the service and all of our content. In order for you to use our content, we give you certain rights to it, but you may only use our content in the way we have allowed.\n1. GitHub&aposs Rights to Content\nGitHub and our licensors, vendors, agents, and/or our content providers retain ownership of all intellectual property rights of any kind related to the Website and Service. We reserve all rights that are not expressly granted to you under this Agreement or by law. The look and feel of the Website and Service is copyright \u00a9 GitHub, Inc. All rights reserved. You may not duplicate, copy, or reuse any portion of the HTML/CSS, Javascript, or visual design elements or concepts without express written permission from GitHub.\n2. GitHub Trademarks and Logos\nIf you\u2019d like to use GitHub\u2019s trademarks, you must follow all of our trademark guidelines, including those on our logos page: https://github.com/logos.\n3. License to GitHub Policies\nThis Agreement is licensed under this Creative Commons Zero license. For details, see our site-policy repository.\nShort version: You agree to these Terms of Service, plus this Section H, when using any of GitHub&aposs APIs (Application Provider Interface), including use of the API through a third party product that accesses GitHub.\nNo Abuse or Overuse of the API\nAbuse or excessively frequent requests to GitHub via the API may result in the temporary or permanent suspension of your Account&aposs access to the API. GitHub, in our sole discretion, will determine abuse or excessive usage of the API. We will make a reasonable attempt to warn you via email prior to suspension.\nYou may not share API tokens to exceed GitHub&aposs rate limitations.\nYou may not use the API to download data or Content from GitHub for spamming purposes, including for the purposes of selling GitHub users&apos personal information, such as to recruiters, headhunters, and job boards.\nAll use of the GitHub API is subject to these Terms of Service and the GitHub Privacy Statement.\nGitHub may offer subscription-based access to our API for those Users who require high-throughput access or access that would result in resale of GitHub&aposs Service.\nShort version: The GitHub Pages hosting service is subject to certain rules, in addition to the rest of the Terms.\nEach GitHub Account comes with access to the GitHub Pages static hosting service. This hosting service is intended to host static web pages for GitHub users. GitHub Pages are subject to some specific bandwidth and usage limits, and may not be appropriate for some high-bandwidth uses or other prohibited uses. Please see our GitHub Pages guidelines for more information.\nGitHub reserves the right at all times to reclaim any GitHub subdomain without liability.\nShort version: You need to follow certain rules if you create an application for other Users, and there are additional Terms that cover the Marketplace.\n1. Creating Applications\nIf you create a third-party application or other developer product that collects User Personal Information or User-Generated Content and integrates with the Service through GitHub&aposs API, OAuth mechanism, or otherwise (\"Developer Product\"), and make it available for other Users, then you must comply with the following requirements:\n---You must comply with this Agreement and the GitHub Privacy Statement.\n---Except as otherwise permitted, such as by law or by a license, you must limit your usage of the User Personal Information or User-Generated Content you collect to that purpose for which the User has authorized its collection. \n---You must take all reasonable security measures appropriate to the risks, such as against accidental or unlawful destruction, or accidental loss, alteration, unauthorized disclosure or access, presented by processing the User Personal Information or User-Generated Content.\n---You must not hold yourself out as collecting any User Personal Information or User-Generated Content on GitHub\u2019s behalf, and provide sufficient notice of your privacy practices to the User, such as by posting a privacy policy.\n---You must provide Users with a method of deleting any User Personal Information or User-Generated Content you have collected through GitHub after it is no longer needed for the limited and specified purposes for which the User authorized its collection, except where retention is required by law or otherwise permitted, such as through a license.\nIf you list a Developer Product through GitHub Marketplace, then you must agree to the GitHub Marketplace Developer Agreement, prior to submitting the project to be listed. \n2. Using Third-Party Applications\nYou may grant a Developer Product authorization to use, access, and disclose the contents of your repositories, including your private repositories. Some Developer Products are available through GitHub Marketplace. Some Developer Products can be used for performing automated tasks, and often times multiple Users may direct the actions of a Developer Product. However, if you purchase and/or set up a Developer Product on your Account, or you are an owner of an Account with an integrated Developer Product, then you will be responsible for the Developer Product&aposs actions that are performed on or through your Account. Please see our Privacy Statement for more information about how we share data with Developer Products. \nGitHub makes no warranties of any kind in relation to Developer Products and is not liable for disclosures to third parties that you authorize to access Your Content. Your use of any third-party applications is at your sole risk.\nIf you buy Developer Products through GitHub Marketplace, the GitHub Marketplace Terms of Service controls your purchase. This Agreement, as well as the GitHub Marketplace Terms of Service, will govern your use of GitHub Marketplace. \nShort version: We do not generally prohibit use of GitHub for advertising. However, we expect our users to follow certain limitations, so GitHub does not become a spam haven. No one wants that.\n1. GitHub Pages\nWe offer Pages sites primarily as a showcase for personal and organizational projects. Some monetization efforts are permitted on Pages, such as donation buttons and crowdfunding links.\n2. GitHub Repositories\nGitHub repositories are intended to host Content. You may include static images, links, and promotional text in the README documents associated with your repositories, but they must be related to the project you are hosting on GitHub.\nYou may not advertise in other Users&apos repositories, such as by posting monetized or excessive bulk content in issues.\n3. Spamming and Inappropriate Use of GitHub\nAdvertising Content, like all Content, must not violate the law or these Terms of Use, for example through excessive bulk activity such as spamming. We reserve the right to remove any advertisements that, in our sole discretion, violate any GitHub terms or policies.\nShort version: You are responsible for any fees associated with your use of GitHub. We are responsible for communicating those fees to you clearly and accurately, and letting you know well in advance if those prices change.\n1. Pricing\nOur pricing and payment terms are available at github.com/pricing. If you agree to a subscription price, that will remain your price for the duration of the payment term; however, prices are subject to change at the end of a payment term.\n2. Upgrades, Downgrades, and Changes\n---We will immediately bill you when you upgrade from the free plan to any paying plan.\n---If you change from a monthly billing plan to a yearly billing plan, GitHub will bill you for a full year at the next monthly billing date.\n---If you upgrade to a higher level of service, we will bill you for the upgraded plan immediately.\n---You may change your level of service at any time by choosing a plan option or going into your Billing settings. If you choose to downgrade your Account, you may lose access to Content, features, or capacity of your Account. Please see our section on Cancellation for information on getting a copy of that Content.\n3. Billing Schedule; No Refunds\n---For monthly or yearly payment plans, the Service is billed in advance on a monthly or yearly basis respectively and is non-refundable. There will be no refunds or credits for partial months of service, downgrade refunds, or refunds for months unused with an open Account; however, the service will remain active for the length of the paid billing period.\n---In order to treat everyone equally, no exceptions will be made.\n4. Authorization\nBy agreeing to these Terms, you are giving us permission to charge your on-file credit card, PayPal account, or other approved methods of payment for fees that you authorize for GitHub.\n5. Responsibility for Payment\nYou are responsible for all fees, including taxes, associated with your use of the Service. By using the Service, you agree to pay GitHub any charge incurred in connection with your use of the Service.  If you dispute the matter, contact GitHub Support. You are responsible for providing us with a valid means of payment for paid Accounts. Free Accounts are not required to provide payment information.\nShort version: You may close your Account at any time. If you do, we&aposll treat your information responsibly.\n1. Account Cancellation\nIt is your responsibility to properly cancel your Account with GitHub. You can cancel your Account at any time by going into your Settings in the global navigation bar at the top of the screen. The Account screen provides a simple, no questions asked cancellation link. We are not able to cancel Accounts in response to an email or phone request.\n2. Upon Cancellation\nWe will retain and use your information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements, but barring legal requirements, we will delete your full profile and the Content of your repositories within 90 days of cancellation or termination (though some information may remain in encrypted backups). This information can not be recovered once your Account is cancelled.\nWe will not delete Content that you have contributed to other Users&apos repositories or that other Users have forked.\nUpon request, we will make a reasonable effort to provide an Account owner with a copy of your lawful, non-infringing Account contents after Account cancellation, termination, or downgrade. You must make this request within 90 days of cancellation, termination, or downgrade.\n3. GitHub May Terminate\nGitHub has the right to suspend or terminate your access to all or any part of the Website at any time, with or without cause, with or without notice, effective immediately. GitHub reserves the right to refuse service to anyone for any reason at any time.\n4. Survival\nAll provisions of this Agreement which by their nature should survive termination will survive termination, including, without limitation, ownership provisions, warranty disclaimers, indemnity, and limitations of liability.\nShort version: We use email and other electronic means to stay in touch with our users.\n1. Electronic Communication Required\nFor contractual purposes, you (1) consent to receive communications from us in an electronic form via the email address you have submitted or via the Service; and (2) agree that all Terms of Service, agreements, notices, disclosures, and other communications that we provide to you electronically satisfy any legal requirement that those communications would satisfy if they were on paper. This section does not affect your non-waivable rights.\n2. Legal Notice to GitHub Must Be in Writing\nCommunications made through email or GitHub Support&aposs messaging system will not constitute legal notice to GitHub or any of its officers, employees, agents or representatives in any situation where notice to GitHub is required by contract or any law or regulation. Legal notice to GitHub must be in writing and served on GitHub&aposs legal agent.\n3. No Phone Support\nGitHub only offers support via email, in-Service communications, and electronic messages. We do not offer telephone support.\nShort version: We provide our service as is, and we make no promises or guarantees about this service. Please read this section carefully; you should understand what to expect.\nGitHub provides the Website and the Service \u201cas is\u201d and \u201cas available,\u201d without warranty of any kind. Without limiting this, we expressly disclaim all warranties, whether express, implied or statutory, regarding the Website and the Service including without limitation any warranty of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, title, security, accuracy and non-infringement.\nGitHub does not warrant that the Service will meet your requirements; that the Service will be uninterrupted, timely, secure, or error-free; that the information provided through the Service is accurate, reliable or correct; that any defects or errors will be corrected; that the Service will be available at any particular time or location; or that the Service is free of viruses or other harmful components. You assume full responsibility and risk of loss resulting from your downloading and/or use of files, information, content or other material obtained from the Service.\nShort version: We will not be liable for damages or losses arising from your use or inability to use the service or otherwise arising under this agreement. Please read this section carefully; it limits our obligations to you.\nYou understand and agree that we will not be liable to you or any third party for any loss of profits, use, goodwill, or data, or for any incidental, indirect, special, consequential or exemplary damages, however arising, that result from\n---the use, disclosure, or display of your User-Generated Content;\n---your use or inability to use the Service;\n---any modification, price change, suspension or discontinuance of the Service;\n---the Service generally or the software or systems that make the Service available;\n---unauthorized access to or alterations of your transmissions or data;\n---statements or conduct of any third party on the Service;\n---any other user interactions that you input or receive through your use of the Service; or\n---any other matter relating to the Service.\nOur liability is limited whether or not we have been informed of the possibility of such damages, and even if a remedy set forth in this Agreement is found to have failed of its essential purpose. We will have no liability for any failure or delay due to matters beyond our reasonable control.\nShort version: You are responsible for your use of the service. If you harm someone else or get into a dispute with someone else, we will not be involved.\nIf you have a dispute with one or more Users, you agree to release GitHub from any and all claims, demands and damages (actual and consequential) of every kind and nature, known and unknown, arising out of or in any way connected with such disputes.\nYou agree to indemnify us, defend us, and hold us harmless from and against any and all claims, liabilities, and expenses, including attorneys\u2019 fees, arising out of your use of the Website and the Service, including but not limited to your violation of this Agreement, provided that GitHub (1) promptly gives you written notice of the claim, demand, suit or proceeding; (2) gives you sole control of the defense and settlement of the claim, demand, suit or proceeding (provided that you may not settle any claim, demand, suit or proceeding unless the settlement unconditionally releases GitHub of all liability); and (3) provides to you all reasonable assistance, at your expense.\nShort version: We want our users to be informed of important changes to our terms, but some changes aren&apost that important \u2014 we don&apost want to bother you every time we fix a typo. So while we may modify this agreement at any time, we will notify users of any changes that affect your rights and give you time to adjust to them.\nWe reserve the right, at our sole discretion, to amend these Terms of Service at any time and will update these Terms of Service in the event of any such amendments. We will notify our Users of material changes to this Agreement, such as price changes, at least 30 days prior to the change taking effect by posting a notice on our Website. For non-material modifications, your continued use of the Website constitutes agreement to our revisions of these Terms of Service. You can view all changes to these Terms in our Site Policy repository.\nWe reserve the right at any time and from time to time to modify or discontinue, temporarily or permanently, the Website (or any part of it) with or without notice.\n1. Governing Law\nExcept to the extent applicable law provides otherwise, this Agreement between you and GitHub and any access to or use of the Website or the Service are governed by the federal laws of the United States of America and the laws of the State of California, without regard to conflict of law provisions.

These section titles and brief summaries are not legally binding.\n4. Severability, No Waiver, and Survival\nIf any part of this Agreement is held invalid or unenforceable, that portion of the Agreement will be construed to reflect the parties\u2019 original intent. The remaining portions will remain in full force and effect. Any failure on the part of GitHub to enforce any provision of this Agreement will not be considered a waiver of our right to enforce such provision. Our rights under this Agreement will survive any termination of this Agreement.\n5. Amendments; Complete Agreement\nThis Agreement may only be modified by a written amendment signed by an authorized representative of GitHub, or by the posting by GitHub of a revised version in accordance with Section R. Changes to These Terms. These Terms of Service, together with the GitHub Privacy Statement, represent the complete and exclusive statement of the agreement between you and us.

FEES AND PAYMENTS\n(A) GENERAL TERMS, INCLUDING AUTOMATIC RENEWAL TERMS\nYou agree to pay any and all prices and fees due for Services purchased or obtained at this Site at the time you order the Services.\u00a0 GoDaddy expressly reserves the right to change or modify its prices and fees at any time, and such changes or modifications shall be posted online at this Site and effective immediately without need for further notice to you.\u00a0 If you have purchased or obtained Services for a period of months or years, changes or modifications in prices and fees shall be effective when the Services in question come up for renewal as further described below.\u00a0\nUnless otherwise specifically noted (for reasons such as those highlighted\u00a0in Section 2(x) above), the renewal price for any domain name in any TLD will be the same as the list (non-sale) price shown when you search for and select a domain, and again in the cart prior to purchase.\u00a0 For example, if the list price is $9.99, and a different renewal price is not specifically identified, then the renewal price is also $9.99.\u00a0 Likewise, if a domain name has a\u00a0sale price of $8.99, with the list\u00a0(non-sale) price\u00a0shown (as a strike-through)\u00a0at $9.99, the renewal price will be\u00a0$9.99*.\u00a0\u00a0\n*Renewal price\u00a0subject to change prior to actual date of renewal.\u00a0 \nFor all other terms and conditions relating to\u00a0fees, payment, refund and billing, etc. applicable to the Services offered under the scope of this Agreement, please refer to the \u201cFees and Payments\u201d section of our\u00a0UTOS.\u00a0\n(B) DOMAIN NAME RENEWAL TERMS\nWhen you register a domain name, you will have three renewal options: (i) \"Automatic Renewal\"\u00a0(ii) \"Extended Automatic Renewal\", and (iii) \"Manual Renewal\":\u00a0\n---Automatic Renewal.\u00a0 Automatic Renewal is the default setting. Therefore, unless you select\u00a0Extended Automatic Renewal, GoDaddy will enroll you in\u00a0Automatic Renewal.\u00a0\u00a0Domain names will automatically renew, for a period equivalent to the length of your original domain name registration, any domain name that is up for renewal and will take payment from the Payment Method you have on file with GoDaddy, at GoDaddy's then current rates. Thus, if you have chosen to register your domain name for one (1) year, GoDaddy will automatically renew it for one (1) year. If you have chosen to register your domain name for two (2) years, GoDaddy will automatically renew it for two (2) years, and so on.\n---Extended Automatic Renewal.\u00a0 If you enroll in the Extended Automatic Renewal plan, GoDaddy will automatically renew any domain name that is up for renewal for an additional one-year period on each and every anniversary of your domain name registration, so the initial registration period will always remain intact.\u00a0 Thus, if you have chosen to register your domain name for two (2) years, GoDaddy will automatically renew it for one (1) additional year on each and every anniversary of your domain name registration so your two (2) year registration period will always remain intact. If you have chosen to register your domain name for five (5) years, GoDaddy will automatically renew it for one (1) additional year on each and every anniversary of your domain name registration so your five (5) year registration period will always remain intact, and so on.\u00a0 GoDaddy will take payment from the Payment Method you have on file with GoDaddy, at GoDaddy's then current one-year domain name registration rate.\n---Manual Renewal.\u00a0 If you have elected to turn off automatic renewal and cancel the product (i.e., cancel\u00a0the domain name registration) effective at expiration of the then current term, you may nonetheless elect to manually renew the domain name at anytime prior to its\u00a0expiration date\u00a0by\u00a0logging into\u00a0your Account Manager\u00a0and manually implementing the renewal or by calling customer service (should you in fact want the domain name to be renewed). If you fail to manually implement the renewal before the expiration date, the domain name will be cancelled and you will no longer have use of that name.\nAll renewals will be subject to the terms of this Agreement, as it may be amended from time to time, and you acknowledge and agree to be bound by the terms of this Agreement (as amended) for all renewed domains.\u00a0 Domain name renewals will be non-refundable. In the event that we are unable to automatically renew your domain name for the renewal option selected for any reason, we may automatically renew your domain name for a period less than your original registration period to the extent necessary for the transaction to succeed. If for any reason GoDaddy is not able to take the payment from the Payment Method you have on file, and you fail to respond to our notices, your domain name registration will expire. It is your responsibility to keep your Payment Method information current, which includes the expiration date if you are using a credit card.\nFor certain ccTLDs (.am, .at, .be, .br, .cn, .com.cn, .net.cn, .org.cn, .de, .eu, .fm, .fr, .gs, .it, .jp, .ms, .nl, .nu, .nz, .co.nz, .net.nz, .org.nz, .se, .tc, .tk, .tw, .com.tw, .org.tw, .idv.tw, .uk, .us, and .vg), renewal billing will occur on the first day of the month prior to the month of expiration.\nFor certain ccTLDs (.am, .at, .be, .ca, .cn, .com.cn, .net.cn, .org.cn, .de, .eu, .fm, .gs, .it, .jp, .ms, .nu, .nz, .co.nz, .net.nz, .org.nz, .tc, .tk, .tw, .com.tw, .org.tw, .idv.tw, .uk,\u00a0and .vg),\u00a0renewal will occur, or must occur manually if the product was previously cancelled, no later than the 20th of the month prior to the expiration date, or your domain name will be placed in non-renewal status. For some ccTLDs (.es) renewal\u00a0must be processed\u00a0no later than seven days before the expiration date, or your domain name will be placed in non-renewal status.\u00a0 When the domain name is in non-renewal status, you can renew the domain name only by calling GoDaddy and requesting that the domain name be renewed. You cannot renew the domain name through your Account Manager. If you fail to manually implement the renewal of any cancelled product before the expiration date, the domain name will be cancelled and you will no longer have use of that name.\nYou agree that GoDaddy will not be responsible for cancelled domain names that you fail to renew in the timeframes indicated in this Agreement. In any case, if you fail to renew your domain name in a timely fashion, additional charges may apply. If you signed up for privacy services, protected registration, or any other similar service, with your domain name registration, these services will automatically be renewed when your domain name registration is up for renewal, and you will incur the applicable additional renewal fee unless you cancel in advance.\u00a0\nIf you fail to renew your domain name in the timeframes indicated in this Agreement, you agree that GoDaddy may, in its sole discretion, renew your expired domain name on your behalf. If GoDaddy decides to renew your expired domain name on your behalf, you will have a Renewal Grace Period during which you may reimburse GoDaddy for the renewal and keep your domain name. The Renewal Grace Period is currently twelve (12) days but subject to change under the terms of this Agreement. For certain ccTLDs (.am, .at, .be, .cn, .com.cn, .net.cn, .org.cn, .de, .eu, .fm, .gs, .it, .jp, .ms, .nu, .nz, .co.nz, .net.nz, .org.nz, .tc, .tk, .tw, .com.tw, .org.tw, .idv.tw, .uk,\u00a0and .vg) there is no Renewal Grace Period after the expiration date of the domain name. If you do not reimburse GoDaddy for the renewal during the Renewal Grace Period your domain name will be placed on Hold and flagged for deletion after which you may have up to a 30-day redemption period to redeem your domain name, provided that your domain name is not subject to an expired domain name auction bid and you pay GoDaddy a Redemption fee. The Redemption fee is currently $80.00 USD and is subject to change under the terms of this Agreement. If you do not redeem your domain name prior to the end of the 30-day redemption period GoDaddy may, in its sole discretion, delete your domain name or transfer it to another registrant on your behalf.\u00a0 During the redemption period your domain name may be parked.\u00a0\nIf your domain name is deleted, the Registry also provides a 30-day Redemption Grace Period during which you may pay GoDaddy a redemption fee and redeem your domain name. The redemption fee is currently $80.00 USD and is subject to change under the terms of this Agreement. If you do not redeem your domain name prior to the end of the Registry's Redemption Grace Period the Registry will release your name and it will become available for registration on a first-come-first-served basis.\nRenewal Grace Periods and Redemption Grace Periods vary for different ccTLDs. Please refer to the specific terms for the applicable TLD. In the event there is a conflict between the provisions of this paragraph and the ccTLD terms, the ccTLD terms shall control.\nOur registration expiration notification policy and associated fees are described\u00a0here.\n(C) FREE PRODUCT TERMS\nIn the event you are provided with free products with the registration of a domain name, you acknowledge and agree that such free products will only be available with a valid purchase and may be terminated in the event the domain name\u00a0is deleted or cancelled.\u00a0 For free domain names, you acknowledge and agree that you may not change the account associated with such free domain for the first five (5) days after registration.\u00a0 In the event a free domain name is offered with the registration of another domain and if the paid domain name registered fails, then we may, in its sole discretion, either delete the registration of the free domain or refund the difference between the amount paid and the value of the free domain.\u00a0 Failed registrations associated with promotionals offers may result in the deletion of the free or discounted item or an adjustment between the registered domain price and the value of the discounted item, in\u00a0our sole discretion.\n4. TERM OF AGREEMENT; TRANSFERS; DOMAIN TASTING\nThe term of this Agreement shall continue in full force and effect as long as you have any domain name registered through GoDaddy.\nYou agree that you will not transfer any domain name registered through GoDaddy to another domain name registrar during the first sixty (60) days after its initial registration date.\u00a0 You agree that you may not transfer any domain name for\u00a0ten (10) days after a Change of Account.\nYou further agree that you will not engage in \"domain tasting\" by using the five (5) day grace period in which a registrant may choose to cancel a domain name and get a full refund of the registration fee as a vehicle to test the marketability or viability of a domain name.\u00a0 If GoDaddy determines (which determination shall be made by GoDaddy in its sole and absolute discretion) that you have been engaging in \"domain tasting\", then GoDaddy reserves the right to (a) charge you a small fee (which fee shall be deducted from any refund issued) or (b) refuse your cancellation/refund request altogether. GoDaddy will not charge you a fee if GoDaddy cancels your domain name during the five (5) day grace period due to fraud or other activity outside of your control. The five (5) day grace period does not apply to Premium Domains, which are non-refundable.\nYou agree that GoDaddy shall not be bound by (i) any representations made by third parties who you may use to purchase services from GoDaddy, or (ii) any statements of a general nature, which may be posted on GoDaddy's website or contained in GoDaddy's promotional materials.\n5. UP TO DATE INFORMATION; USE OF INFORMATION AND EXPIRATION\nYou agree to notify GoDaddy within five (5) business days when any of the information you provided as part of the application and/or registration process changes. It is your responsibility to keep this information in a current and accurate status. Failure by you, for whatever reason, to provide GoDaddy with accurate and reliable information on an initial and continual basis, shall be considered to be a material breach of this Agreement and a basis for suspension and/or cancellation of the domain name. Failure by you, for whatever reason, to respond within five (5) business days to any inquiries made by GoDaddy to determine the validity of information provided by you, shall also be considered to be a material breach of this Agreement and a basis for suspension and/or cancellation of the domain name. You agree to retain a copy for your record of the receipt for purchase of your domain name.\nYou agree that for each domain name registered by you, the following contact data is required: postal address, email address, telephone number, and if available, a facsimile number for the Registered Name Holder and, if different from the Registered Name Holder, the same contact information for, a technical contact, an administrative contact and a billing contact.\nYou acknowledge and agree that domain name registration requires that this contact information, in whole or in part, be shared with the registry operator, for their use, copying, distribution, publication, modification and other processing \u00a0for (among other uses in accordance with our Privacy Policy) the purpose of administration of the domain name registration, which may require such information be transferred back and forth across international borders, to and from the U.S. to the EU, for example. As required by ICANN, this information must also be made publicly available by means of Whois, and that the registry operator may also be required to make this information publicly available by Whois. Both GoDaddy and the registry operator may be required to archive this information with a third-party escrow service. You hereby consent and give permission for all such requirements and disclosures. Further, you represent and warrant that, if you are providing information about a third party, you have notified the third party of the disclosure and the purpose for the disclosure and you have obtained the third party's consent to such disclosure.\u00a0 Registrar will not process data in a way that is incompatible with this Agreement.\u00a0 Registrar will take reasonable precautions to protect data from loss or misuse.\nYou agree that for each domain name registered by you the following information will be made publicly available in the Whois directory as determined by ICANN Policy and may be sold in bulk as set forth in the ICANN agreement:\n---The domain name;\n---Your name and postal address;\n---The name, email address, postal address, voice and fax numbers for technical and administrative contacts;\n---The Internet protocol numbers for the primary and secondary name servers;\n---The corresponding names of the name servers; and\n---The original date of registration and expiration date.\n---Name of primary name server and secondary name server.\n---Identity of the registrar.\nYou agree that, to the extent permitted by ICANN, GoDaddy may make use of the publicly available information you provided during the registration process.

These proceedings will be conducted before one of the administrative-dispute-resolution service providers listed here (each, a \"Provider\").\n---\nApplicable Disputes. You are required to submit to a mandatory administrative proceeding in the event that a third party (a \"complainant\") asserts to the applicable Provider, in compliance with the Rules of Procedure, that \nyour domain name is identical or confusingly similar to a trademark or service mark in which the complainant has rights; and \nyou have no rights or legitimate interests in respect of the domain name; and \nyour domain name has been registered and is being used in bad faith. \nIn the administrative proceeding, the complainant must prove that each of these three elements are present. \nEvidence of Registration and Use in Bad Faith. For the purposes of Paragraph 4(a)(iii), the following circumstances, in particular but without limitation, if found by the Panel to be present, shall be evidence of the registration and use of a domain name in bad faith: \ncircumstances indicating that you have registered or you have acquired the domain name primarily for the purpose of selling, renting, or otherwise transferring the domain name registration to the complainant who is the owner of the trademark or service mark or to a competitor of that complainant, for valuable consideration in excess of your documented out-of-pocket costs directly related to the domain name; or \nyou have registered the domain name in order to prevent the owner of the trademark or service mark from reflecting the mark in a corresponding domain name, provided that you have engaged in a pattern of such conduct; or \nyou have registered the domain name primarily for the purpose of disrupting the business of a competitor; or \nby using the domain name, you have intentionally attempted to attract, for commercial gain, Internet users to your web site or other on-line location, by creating a likelihood of confusion with the complainant's mark as to the source, sponsorship, affiliation, or endorsement of your web site or location or of a product or service on your web site or location. \nHow to Demonstrate Your Rights to and Legitimate Interests in the Domain Name in Responding to a Complaint. When you receive a complaint, you should refer to Paragraph 5 of the Rules of Procedure in determining how your response should be prepared. Any of the following circumstances, in particular but without limitation, if found by the Panel to be proved based on its evaluation of all evidence presented, shall demonstrate your rights or legitimate interests to the domain name for purposes of Paragraph 4(a)(ii): \nbefore any notice to you of the dispute, your use of, or demonstrable preparations to use, the domain name or a name corresponding to the domain name in connection with a bona fide offering of goods or services; or \nyou (as an individual, business, or other organization) have been commonly known by the domain name, even if you have acquired no trademark or service mark rights; or \nyou are making a legitimate noncommercial or fair use of the domain name, without intent for commercial gain to misleadingly divert consumers or to tarnish the trademark or service mark at issue. \nSelection of Provider. The complainant shall select the Provider from among those approved by ICANN by submitting the complaint to that Provider. The selected Provider will administer the proceeding, except in cases of consolidation as described in Paragraph 4(f). \nInitiation of Proceeding and Process and Appointment of Administrative Panel. The Rules of Procedure state the process for initiating and conducting a proceeding and for appointing the panel that will decide the dispute (the \"Administrative Panel\"). \nConsolidation. In the event of multiple disputes between you and a complainant, either you or the complainant may petition to consolidate the disputes before a single Administrative Panel. This petition shall be made to the first Administrative Panel appointed to hear a pending dispute between the parties. This Administrative Panel may consolidate before it any or all such disputes in its sole discretion, provided that the disputes being consolidated are governed by this Policy or a later version of this Policy adopted by ICANN. \nFees. All fees charged by a Provider in connection with any dispute before an Administrative Panel pursuant to this Policy shall be paid by the complainant, except in cases where you elect to expand the Administrative Panel from one to three panelists as provided in Paragraph 5(b)(iv) of the Rules of Procedure, in which case all fees will be split evenly by you and the complainant. \nOur Involvement in Administrative Proceedings. We do not, and will not, participate in the administration or conduct of any proceeding before an Administrative Panel. In addition, we will not be liable as a result of any decisions rendered by the Administrative Panel. \nRemedies. The remedies available to a complainant pursuant to any proceeding before an Administrative Panel shall be limited to requiring the cancellation of your domain name or the transfer of your domain name registration to the complainant. \nNotification and Publication. The Provider shall notify us of any decision made by an Administrative Panel with respect to a domain name you have registered with us. All decisions under this Policy will be published in full over the Internet, except when an Administrative Panel determines in an exceptional case to redact portions of its decision. \nAvailability of Court Proceedings. The mandatory administrative proceeding requirements set forth in Paragraph 4 shall not prevent either you or the complainant from submitting the dispute to a court of competent jurisdiction for independent resolution before such mandatory administrative proceeding is commenced or after such proceeding is concluded. If an Administrative Panel decides that your domain name registration should be canceled or transferred, we will wait ten (10) business days (as observed in the location of our principal office) after we are informed by the applicable Provider of the Administrative Panel's decision before implementing that decision. We will then implement the decision unless we have received from you during that ten (10) business day period official documentation (such as a copy of a complaint, file-stamped by the clerk of the court) that you have commenced a lawsuit against the complainant in a jurisdiction to which the complainant has submitted under Paragraph 3(b)(xiii) of the Rules of Procedure. (In general, that jurisdiction is either the location of our principal office or of your address as shown in our Whois database. See Paragraphs 1 and 3(b)(xiii) of the Rules of Procedure for details.) If we receive such documentation within the ten (10) business day period, we will not implement the Administrative Panel's decision, and we will take no further action, until we receive (i) evidence satisfactory to us of a resolution between the parties; (ii) evidence satisfactory to us that your lawsuit has been dismissed or withdrawn; or (iii) a copy of an order from such court dismissing your lawsuit or ordering that you do not have the right to continue to use your domain name. \n5.

If you are being billed on a monthly basis, your monthly billing date will be based on the date of the month you purchased the Services, unless that date falls after the 28th of the month, in which case your billing date will be the 28th of each month.\u00a0\nAuto-Renewal Terms. Other than as required by applicable law, GoDaddy does not retain hard copies or electronic versions of mandate, standing order or standing instruction forms and/or any signed consents relating to your usage of our automatic renewal services, and we are therefore unable to provide any such document upon request. You may view or change your automatic renewal settings at any time by logging into your GoDaddy account.\nIn order to ensure that you do not experience an interruption or loss of Services,\u00a0all Services are\u00a0offered on automatic renewal.\u00a0\u00a0Except for reasons\u00a0described\u00a0below in this section, automatic renewal automatically renews the applicable Service upon expiration of the then current term for a renewal period equal in time to the most recent service period (except for domain names which may renew for the original service\u00a0period). For example,\u00a0if your last service period is for one year, your renewal period will typically be for one year.\u00a0\u00a0However,\u00a0in the\u00a0event renewal\u00a0with the Payment Method on file fails,\u00a0GoDaddy may\u00a0attempt to renew the applicable service for a period less than the original subscription period to the extent necessary for the transaction to succeed.\u00a0\nUnless you disable the automatic renewal option, GoDaddy will automatically renew the applicable Service when it comes up for renewal and will take payment from any Payment Method you have on file with GoDaddy at GoDaddy\u2019s then current rates, which you acknowledge and agree may be higher or lower than the rates for the original service period.\u00a0 In order to see the renewal settings applicable to you and your Services, simply log into your Account manager\u00a0from this Site and follow the steps found here.\u00a0 If you do not wish for any Service to automatically renew, you may elect to cancel renewal, in which case,\u00a0your\u00a0Services will terminate upon expiration of the then current term, unless you manually renew your Services prior to that date (in which case the Services will again be set to automatic renewal).\u00a0\u00a0In other words,\u00a0should you elect to cancel your product and fail to manually renew your Services before they expire, you may experience an interruption or loss of Services, and GoDaddy shall not be liable to you or any third party regarding the same.\nIn addition, GoDaddy may participate in \u201crecurring billing programs\u201d or \u201caccount updater services\u201d supported by your credit card provider (and ultimately dependent on your bank\u2019s participation).\u00a0 If we are unable to successfully charge your existing Payment Method, your credit card provider (or your bank) may notify us of updates to your credit card number and/or expiration date, or they may automatically charge your new credit card on our behalf without notification to us.\u00a0 In accordance with recurring billing program requirements, in the event that we are notified of an update to your credit card number and/or expiration date, GoDaddy will automatically update your payment profile on your behalf. GoDaddy makes no guarantees that we will request or receive updated credit card information. You acknowledge and agree that it is your sole responsibility to modify and maintain your Account settings, including but not limited to (i) cancelling products and (ii) ensuring your associated Payment Method(s) are current and valid.\u00a0 Further, you acknowledge and agree that your failure to do so, may result in the interruption or loss of Services, and GoDaddy shall not be liable to you or any third party regarding the same.\u00a0\nIf for any reason GoDaddy is unable to charge your Payment Method for the full amount owed, or if GoDaddy receives notification of a chargeback, reversal, payment dispute, or is charged a penalty for any fee it previously charged to your Payment Method, you agree that GoDaddy may pursue all available lawful remedies in order to obtain payment, including but not limited to, immediate cancellation, without notice to you, of any domain names or Services registered or renewed on your behalf. \u00a0GoDaddy also reserves the right to charge you reasonable \u201cadministrative\u201d fees\" for (i) tasks GoDaddy may perform outside the normal scope of its Services, (ii) additional time and/or costs GoDaddy may incur in providing its Services, and/or (iii) your noncompliance with this Agreement (as determined by GoDaddy in its sole and absolute discretion). Typical administrative or processing fee scenarios include, but are not limited to (i) customer service issues that require additional personal time or attention; (ii) UDRP actions(s) in connection with your domain name(s) and/or disputes that require accounting or legal services, whether performed by GoDaddy staff or by outside firms retained by GoDaddy; (iii) recouping any and all costs and fees, including the cost of Services, incurred by GoDaddy as the results of chargebacks or other payment disputes brought by you, your bank or Payment Method processor. These administrative fees or processing fees will be billed to the Payment Method you have on file with GoDaddy.\nGoDaddy may offer product-level pricing in various currencies. The transaction will be processed in the selected currency and the pricing displayed during the checkout process will be the actual amount submitted for payment.\u00a0 For certain Payment Methods, the issuer of your Payment Method may charge you a foreign transaction fee or other charge, which may be added to the final amount that appears on your bank statement or post as a separate amount. Please check with the issuer of your Payment Method for details. In addition, regardless of the selected currency, you acknowledge and agree that you may be charged Value Added Tax (\"VAT\"), Goods and Services Tax (\"GST\"), or other localized fees and/or taxes, based on your bank and/or the country indicated in your billing address section.\n(B) REFUND POLICY\nProducts and Services available for refunds are described\u00a0here\u00a0(\u201cRefund Policy\u201d).\u00a0\n(C) GOOD AS GOLD PREPAID SERVICES\nService Details. By using Good As Gold Prepaid Services, you may transfer funds to GoDaddy to fund your Good As Gold Prepaid Services account (\u201cGood As Gold Account\u201d).\u00a0You may then use your Good As Gold Account to purchase any\u00a0Services.\u00a0You may fund your Good As Gold Account by wire transfer.\nYou acknowledge that funds transferred to your Good As Gold Account will be held by GoDaddy and will not accrue or pay interest for your benefit. To the extent any interest may accrue, you agree that GoDaddy shall be entitled to receive and keep any such amounts to cover costs associated with Good As Gold Prepaid Services.\nYou agree that all transactions using Good As Gold Prepaid Services will be conducted in U.S. dollars.\nYour Good As Gold Account must be funded on an initial basis with no less than funds equivalent to $1000.00 U.S. dollars.\nAll payments must be for the full amount required at purchase.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nWire Transfer Details.

Any non-U.S. wire transfers may be subject to fees\u00a0by your bank, intermediary banks, or GoDaddy\u2019s bank, which may reduce the amount of the money received by GoDaddy\u2019s bank and subsequently funded into your Good As Gold Account. You hereby expressly\u00a0authorize GoDaddy\u00a0(i) to reduce your Good As Gold Account by the amount of wire transfer fees GoDaddy incurs in order to receive your funds; and/or (ii) to charge a twenty-dollar ($20.00) service fee (\u201cService Fee\u201d) in connection with the termination of your Good As Gold Account.\u00a0 All fees are subject to change at any time, and\u00a0such changes shall\u00a0be posted online and effective immediately without need for further notice to you.\nYou can verify the remaining funds in your Good As Gold Account at any time through your\u00a0 Account or the shopping cart. Should you decide to terminate your Good As Gold Account (or should GoDaddy opt to terminate your Good As Gold Account because you have breached an obligation under the Good As Gold Service Agreement), then the balance in your Good As Gold Account will be refunded, net the Service Fee.\nAdditional funds may be added to your Good As Gold Account at any time.\nYour Use of Good As Gold Prepaid Services. Use of funds in your Good As Gold Account can only be made through the GoDaddy purchase process at GoDaddy\u2019s website. Purchases may not be made unless there are sufficient, available funds in your Good As Gold Account at the time of purchase to cover the entire purchase amount, including any related fees as set forth herein or in other relevant agreements.\n(D) PAY BY CHECK (ELECTRONIC PAYMENT)\nBy using GoDaddy\u2019s pay by check option (\u201cPay By Check\u201d), you can purchase GoDaddy Services using an electronic payment (from your personal or business checking account (\u201cChecking Account\u201d), as appropriate). In connection, you agree to allow a third-party check services provider, Certegy Check Services, Inc., (\u201cCheck Services Provider\u201d) to debit the full amount of your purchase from your Checking Account, which is non-refundable. Check Services Provider will create an electronic funds transfer (\u201cEFT\u201d) or bank draft, which will be presented to your bank or financial institution for payment from your Checking Account. The Checking Account must be at a financial institution in the United States, and payment must be in U.S. Dollars.\nIt is your responsibility to keep your Checking Account current and funded. You agree that (i) Check Services Provider or GoDaddy reserve the right to decline a transaction for any reason (including, but not limited to, payments that fail to go through as a result of your Checking Account no longer existing or not holding available/sufficient funds) and (ii) in such event, neither Check Services Provider nor GoDaddy shall be liable to you or any third party regarding the same.\u00a0If for any reason Check Services Provider is unable to withdraw the full amount owed for the Services provided, you agree that Check Services Provider and GoDaddy may pursue all available lawful remedies in order to obtain payment (plus any applicable fees).\u00a0 GoDaddy is not responsible for the actions of Check Services Provider.\u00a0You agree that if the EFT or bank draft is returned unpaid, you will pay a service charge in accordance with the fees permitted by law for each U.S. State. A help article describing the Check Services Provider and outlining the service charges referenced above can be found here. These fees may be debited from your Checking Account using an EFT or bank draft.\u00a0All fees are in U.S. Dollars.\nGoDaddy and its service providers, including but not limited to Check Services Provider\u00a0 and Complete Payment Recovery Services, Inc., may provide you with notices, including byemail, regular mail, SMS, MMS, text message, postings on the services, or other reasonable means now known or hereafter developed. Such notices may not be received if you violate these terms of service by accessing the services in an unauthorized manner. Your agreement to these terms of service constitutes your agreement that you are deemed to have received any and all notices that would have been delivered had you accessed the services in an authorized manner. Failure to receive such notices for any reason shall not excuse any payment or other obligation to GoDaddy and Check Services Provider. You further expressly authorize GoDaddy and its service providers, including but not limited to Check Services Provider and Complete Payment Recovery Services, Inc., and their affiliates to contact you, via auto-dialer, pre-recorded messages, or any other method, on any of your mobile phone numbers or emails. You further acknowledge that email addresses you provide are not shared, accessed by others and are not employer-related email addresses. \n(E) INTERNATIONAL PAYMENT OPTIONS\nGoDaddy\u00a0offers a variety of alternative international payment options through a variety of International Payment Providers (\u201cIPP\u201d).\u00a0In the event you select an IPP, you represent that you have already agreed to any and all of the IPP\u2019s applicable customer service agreements in advance of completing your transaction at GoDaddy.\u00a0 You also agree to allow the IPP to debit the full amount of your purchase from the selected account or payment method, collectively \u201cFunding Sources\u201d. In addition, you agree to allow the selected IPP to debit, if applicable, an \u201cExchange Rate Conversion Fee\u201d, as well as any other fees or charges applicable to your agreement with the IPP (collectively, the \u201cIPP Fees\u201d), from your Funding Sources. You understand and agree that IPP Fees are subject to change at any time by the IPP without notice to you by GoDaddy.\nIt is your responsibility to keep your Funding Sources current and funded. You agree that (i) the IPP or GoDaddy reserve the right to decline a transaction for any reason and (ii) neither the IPP nor GoDaddy shall be liable to you or any third party regarding the same. You acknowledge that GoDaddy will not attempt to fulfill the Services purchased by you until GoDaddy receives confirmation of payment from the IPP through its associated payment processor. You acknowledge there may be a gap of several hours or days between the time you place an order and the time the IPP confirms payment through its associated payment processor. If GoDaddy does not receive confirmation of payment from the IPP through its associated payment processor within thirty (30) days from when the order is placed, your order may be cancelled, at which time you will need to commence the purchase process again. In the event that you would like to cancel payment for a pending transaction, you may cancel the order through your GoDaddy account. Payments received on previously cancelled orders will be automatically refunded to the original Payment Method when possible.\nIf, at the time GoDaddy receives confirmation of payment from the IPP (through its associated payment processor), either (i) the Services (including domain names) are no longer available for purchase; or (ii) a pending order has been cancelled in our systems; or (iii) the confirmation of payment does not match the dollar amount of the pending order, and as a result your purchase is either over-funded or under-funded, GoDaddy may automatically issue a partial refund (in the case of over-funding) or a full refund (in the case of under-funding) to your Funding Source. If the IPP (or its associated payment processor) imposes refund limitations of any kind, GoDaddy reserves the right to issue refunds to an in-store credit balance or as a bank transfer, when the payment processor cannot refund back to the Payment Method. \u00a0If you receive a full refund, you will need to begin the purchase process again.\u00a0You agree that the IPP reserves the right not to refund IPP Fees associated with a refunded transaction.\u00a0Accordingly, any refunds issued by GoDaddy will be net of the IPP Fees unless otherwise specified.\nGoDaddy\u00a0offers SEPA Direct Debit (\u201cSEPA\u201d) as a payment method for customers located in Germany. If you choose to use SEPA as a payment method, you are authorizing GoDaddy\u00a0and Adyen, our payment service provider, to send instructions to your bank to debit your account. By agreeing to these terms you have mandated GoDaddy to collect all of the applicable charges arising under this Agreement. The authorization shall also apply to any new bank account used by you for purchases from GoDaddy. \u00a0We will notify you of the date of direct debit collection within a reasonable time (the \u201cpre-notification\u201d). This pre-notification will be delivered to you by e-mail at least one (1) business day before payment is collected. You are responsible for making sure that there are sufficient funds in your account to cover any debit payments. You also agree to indemnify GoDaddy\u00a0against any losses that it may incur if your financial institution withholds payment from GoDaddy\u00a0for any reason.\n(F) IN-STORE CREDIT BALANCES\nIn the event that your Account contains an in-store credit balance: (1) you may apply any available credit balance to any future purchase in your Account; and (2)\u00a0 you authorize GoDaddy to apply any available credit balance to any outstanding administrative fees, chargebacks, or other fees related to your Account.\u00a0In the event that your default Payment Method fails for an automated billing in connection with the processing of any Service renewals,\u00a0GoDaddy may use any available in-store credit balance if there are enough funds to cover the entire transaction. Regardless of the amount of in-store credit available in your account,\u00a0GoDaddy is not responsible for the loss of products resulting from an inability to collect funds from your default Payment Methods or the in-store credit.\u00a0In-store credits will be applied based on the currency selected in the shopping cart at the time of purchase (or renewal). If you have more than one in-store credit, then the credits will be processed according to the age of the credit, with the oldest in-store credit being applied first. If additional funds are required to complete the purchase or renewal, credits held in a non-selected currency will be converted using GoDaddy\u2019s daily exchange rate based on the age of the credit (oldest to newest) until (i) enough funds are allocated to complete the transaction, or (ii) there is no available balance left in your account. You understand and agree that at the time of conversion, GoDaddy may also impose an additional administrative fee.\nYou can verify your available in-store credit balance at any time through your Account on the GoDaddy website. You acknowledge that in-store credit balances are non-transferrable,\u00a0may only be used in the Account in which they were acquired and may expire. Complimentary in-store credits will expire two years after issuance.\u00a0In the event that GoDaddy terminates your Account, you acknowledge and agree that any remaining available in-store credit balance will be forfeited.\u00a0\nYou also acknowledge that funds available in your in-store credit balance will be held by GoDaddy and will not accrue or pay interest for your behalf. To the extent any interest may accrue, you agree that GoDaddy is entitled to receive and keep any such amounts to cover costs associated with supporting the in-store credit balance functionality.\n(G) EXPIRED DOMAIN NAME PURCHASES\nFor expired domains names purchased through your account, you agree that you are responsible for payment within forty-eight (48) hours of auction close for the successful bid amount plus the one (1) year renewal or transfer fee (from the end of the domain name\u2019s previous registration period), plus ICANN fee, if applicable, or any valid payment method associated with the account, will be charged on the third day following the auction close. If we are unable to collect payment, you may lose the rights to purchase the domain name.\n14.

DISPUTES, BINDING INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATION AND WAIVER OF CLASS ACTIONS AND CLASS ARBITRATIONS\nPLEASE READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY.\u00a0 FOLLOW THE INSTRUCTIONS BELOW IF YOU WISH TO OPT OUT OF THE PROVISIONS REQUIRING YOU TO RESOLVE DISPUTES THROUGH INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATION.\n(A)\u00a0Disputes.\u00a0The terms of this Section shall apply to all Disputes between you and GoDaddy, except for disputes governed by the Uniform Domain Name Dispute Resolution Policy referenced above and available\u00a0here.\u00a0 For the purposes of this Section, \u201cDispute\u201d shall mean any dispute, claim, or action between you and GoDaddy arising under or relating to any GoDaddy Services or Products, GoDaddy\u2019s websites, these Terms, or any other transaction involving you and GoDaddy, whether in contract, warranty, misrepresentation, fraud, tort, intentional tort, statute, regulation, ordinance, or any other legal or equitable basis, and shall be interpreted to be given the broadest meaning allowable under law. YOU AND\u00a0GoDaddy AGREE THAT \u201cDISPUTE\u201d AS DEFINED IN THESE TERMS SHALL NOT INCLUDE ANY CLAIM OR CAUSE OF ACTION BY YOU OR GoDaddy FOR (i) TRADE SECRET MISAPPROPRIATION, (ii) PATENT INFRINGEMENT, (iii) COPYRIGHT INFRINGEMENT OR MISUSE, AND (iv) TRADEMARK INFRINGEMENT OR DILUTION. Moreover, notwithstanding anything else in these Terms, you agree that a court, not the arbitrator, may decide if a claim falls within one of these four exceptions.\n(B)\u00a0Binding Arbitration.\u00a0You and GoDaddy further agree: (i) to arbitrate all Disputes between the parties pursuant to the provisions in these Terms; (ii) these Terms memorialize a transaction in interstate commerce; (iii) the Federal Arbitration Act (9 U.S.C. \u00a71, et seq.) governs the interpretation and enforcement of this Section; and (iv) this Section shall survive termination of these Terms. ARBITRATION MEANS THAT YOU WAIVE YOUR RIGHT TO A JUDGE OR JURY IN A COURT PROCEEDING AND YOUR GROUNDS FOR APPEAL ARE LIMITED. The arbitrator may award you the same damages as a court sitting in proper jurisdiction, as limited by the Limitation of Liability set forth in Section 15 of this Agreement and may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party\u2019s individual claim. In addition, in some instances, the costs of arbitration could exceed the costs of litigation and the right to discovery may be more limited in arbitration than in court. The decision of the arbitrator shall be final and enforceable by any court with jurisdiction over the parties.\n(C)\u00a0Small Claims Court.\u00a0Notwithstanding the foregoing, you may bring an individual action in the small claims court of your state or municipality if the action is within that court\u2019s jurisdiction and is pending only in that court.\n(D)\u00a0Dispute Notice.\u00a0In the event of a Dispute, you or GoDaddy must first send to the other party a notice of the Dispute that shall include a written statement that sets forth the name, address and contact information of the party giving it, the facts giving rise to the Dispute, and the relief requested (the \u201cDispute Notice\u201d). The Dispute Notice to GoDaddy must be addressed to: GoDaddy , 14455 N. Hayden Rd., Scottsdale, AZ 85260, Attn.: Legal Department (the \u201cGoDaddy Notice Address\u201d). The Dispute Notice to you will be sent by certified mail to the most recent address we have on file or otherwise in our records for you.\u00a0 If GoDaddy and you do not reach an agreement to resolve the Dispute within sixty (60) days after the Dispute Notice is received, you or GoDaddy may commence an arbitration proceeding pursuant to this Section. Following submission and receipt of the Dispute Notice, each of us agrees to act in good faith to seek to resolve the Dispute before commencing arbitration.\n(E)\u00a0WAIVER OF CLASS ACTIONS AND CLASS ARBITRATIONS.\u00a0YOU AND\u00a0GoDaddy AGREE THAT EACH PARTY MAY BRING DISPUTES AGAINST THE OTHER PARTY ONLY IN AN INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION FEDERAL OR STATE CLASS ACTIONS, OR CLASS ARBITRATIONS.\u00a0 NEITHER YOU NOR GoDaddy WILL SEEK TO HAVE ANY DISPUTE HEARD AS A CLASS ACTION, PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL ACTION, OR IN ANY OTHER PROCEEDING IN WHICH EITHER PARTY ACTS OF PROPOSES TO ACT IN A REPRESENTATIVE CAPACITY.\u00a0 NO ARBITRATION OR OTHER PROCEEDING WILL BE COMBINED WITH ANOTHER WITHOUT THE PRIOR WRITTEN CONSENT OF ALL PARTIES TO ALL AFFECTED ARBITRATIONS OR PROCEEDINGS.\n(F)\u00a0Arbitration Procedure.\u00a0If a party elects to commence arbitration, the arbitration will be administered by the American Arbitration Association (\u201cAAA\u201d) and governed by the Consumer Arbitration Rules of the AAA (\u201cAAA Rules\u201d) in conjunction with the rules set forth in these Terms, except that AAA may not administer any multiple claimant or class arbitration, as the parties agree that the arbitration shall be limited to the resolution only of individual claims.\u00a0 The AAA Rules are at www.adr.org or by calling 1-800-778-7879. If there is a conflict between the AAA Rules and the rules set forth in these Terms, the rules set forth in these Terms shall govern. You may, in arbitration, seek any and all remedies otherwise available to you pursuant to federal, state, or local laws, as limited by the Limitation of Liability set forth in Section 15 of this Agreement. All Disputes shall be resolved by a single neutral arbitrator, and both parties shall have a reasonable opportunity to participate in the selection of the arbitrator. The arbitrator is bound by these Terms. The arbitrator, and not any federal, state or local court or agency, shall have exclusive authority to resolve all disputes arising out of or relating to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability or formation of these Terms, including, but not limited to, any claim that all or any part of these Terms is void or voidable.\u00a0 The arbitrator shall also have exclusive authority to rule on his or her own jurisdiction, including any objections with respect to the existence, scope, or validity of the arbitration agreement or to the arbitrability of any claim or counterclaim.\u00a0 Notwithstanding this broad delegation of authority to the arbitrator, a court may determine the limited question of whether a claim or cause of action is for (i) trade secret misappropriation, (ii) patent infringement, (iii) copyright infringement or misuse, or (iv) trademark infringement or dilution, which are excluded from the definition of \u201cDisputes\u201d as stated above. The arbitrator shall be empowered to grant whatever relief would be available in a court under law or in equity. The arbitrator\u2019s award shall be binding on the parties and may be entered as a judgment in any court of competent jurisdiction. You may choose to engage in arbitration hearings by telephone. Arbitration hearings not conducted by telephone shall take place in a location reasonably accessible from your primary residence (or principal place of business if you are a small business), or in Maricopa County, Arizona, at your option.\n(G)\u00a0Initiation of Arbitration Proceeding.\u00a0If either you or GoDaddy decide to arbitrate a Dispute, we agree to the following procedure:\ni.\u00a0\u00a0 Write a Demand for Arbitration. The demand must include a description of the Dispute and the amount of damages sought to be recovered. You can find a copy of a Demand for Arbitration at http://www.adr.org (\u201cDemand for Arbitration: Consumer Arbitration Rules\u201d).\nii. \u00a0Send one copy of the Demand for Arbitration to AAA by mail at American Arbitration Association Case Filing Services 1101 Laurel Oak Road, Suite 100 Voorhees, NJ 08043.\u00a0\niii. Send one copy of the Demand for Arbitration to the other party at the same address as the Dispute Notice, or as otherwise agreed to by the parties.\n(H)\u00a0Hearing Format.\u00a0In all hearing formats, the arbitrator shall issue a written decision that explains the essential findings and conclusions on which an award, if any, is based. During the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by GoDaddy or you shall not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator determines the amount, if any, to which you or GoDaddy is entitled. The discovery or exchange of non-privileged information relevant to the Dispute may be allowed during the arbitration.\n(I)\u00a0Arbitration Fees and Payments.\ni. Disputes involving $75,000 or less. GoDaddy will promptly reimburse your filing fees and pay the AAA\u2019s and arbitrator\u2019s fees and expenses. If you reject GoDaddy\u2019s last written settlement offer made before the arbitrator was appointed (\u201cGoDaddy\u2019s last written offer\u201d), your dispute goes all the way to an arbitrator\u2019s decision (called an \u201caward\u201d), and the arbitrator awards you more than GoDaddy\u2019s last written offer, GoDaddy will: (i) pay the greater of the award or $1,000; (ii) pay twice your reasonable attorney\u2019s fees, if any; and (iii) reimburse any expenses (including expert witness fees and costs) that your attorney reasonably accrues for investigating, preparing, and pursuing your claim in arbitration. The arbitrator will determine the amount of fees, costs, and expenses unless you and GoDaddy agree on them.\nii. Disputes involving more than $75,000. The AAA rules will govern payment of filing fees and the AAA\u2019s and arbitrator\u2019s fees and expenses.\niii. Disputes involving any amount. In any arbitration you commence, GoDaddy will seek its AAA or arbitrator\u2019s fees and expenses, or your filing fees it reimbursed, only if the arbitrator finds the arbitration frivolous or brought for an improper purpose. In any arbitration GoDaddy commences, GoDaddy will pay all filing, AAA, and arbitrator\u2019s fees and expenses.\u00a0 GoDaddy will not seek its attorney\u2019s fees or expenses from you in any arbitration.\u00a0 Fees and expenses are not included in determining the amount in dispute.\n(J)\u00a0Claims or Disputes Must be Filed Within One Year.\u00a0 To the extent permitted by law, any claim or dispute to which this Section applies must be filed within one year in small claims or in arbitration. The one-year period begins when the claim or Notice of Dispute first could be filed.\u00a0 If not filed within one year, the claim or dispute will be permanently barred.\n(K)\u00a030-Day Opt-out Period.\u00a0IF YOU DO NOT WISH TO BE BOUND BY THE ARBITRATION PROVISION IN THIS DISPUTES SECTION, YOU MUST NOTIFY GoDaddy BY E-MAILING LEGALOPTOUT@GODADDY.COM WITHIN 30 DAYS OF THE DATE THAT YOU ACCEPT THESE TERMS (UNLESS A LONGER PERIOD IS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW). In the e-mail, you must provide your (a) first name, (b) last name (c) address, (d) phone number, and (e) account number(s) and state the following: \u201cI wish to opt out of the arbitration provision contained in GoDaddy\u2019s Universal Terms of Service Agreement.\u201d By providing your information in the method above, you are opting out of the agreement to arbitrate contained in GoDaddy\u2019s Universal Terms of Service.\u00a0Your opt-out request will only be valid if made within thirty (30) days of first accepting the Universal Terms of Service. In the event that you opt-out consistent with the procedure set forth above, all other terms shall contained herein shall continue to apply, including those related to the applicable governing law and the court(s) in which legal disputes may be brought.\n(L)\u00a0Amendments to this Section.\u00a0Notwithstanding any provision in these Terms to the contrary, you and GoDaddy agree that if GoDaddy makes any future amendments to the dispute resolution procedure and class action waiver provisions (other than a change to GoDaddy\u2019s address) in these Terms, GoDaddy will notify you and you will have thirty (30) days from the date of notice to affirmatively opt-out of any such amendments.\u00a0 If you affirmatively opt-out of any future amendments, you are agreeing that you will arbitrate any Dispute between us in accordance with the language of this Section as stated in these current Terms, without any of the proposed amendments governing.\u00a0 If you do not affirmatively opt-out of any future amendments, you will be deemed to have consented to any such future amendments.\n(M)\u00a0Severability. If any provision in this Section is found to be unenforceable, that provision shall be severed with the remainder of these Terms remaining in full force and effect. The foregoing shall not apply to the prohibition against class or representative actions; if the prohibition against class or representative actions is found to be unenforceable, this entire Section shall be null and void. The terms of this Section shall otherwise survive any termination of these Terms.\n(N)\u00a0Exclusive Venue for Other Controversies.\u00a0GoDaddy and you agree that any controversy excluded from the dispute resolution procedure and class action waiver provisions in this Section (other than an individual action filed in small claims court) shall be filed only in the Superior Court of Maricopa County, Arizona, or the United States District Court for the District of Arizona, and each party hereby irrevocably and unconditionally consents and submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of such courts for any such controversy.\u00a0 You also agree to waive the right to trial by jury in any such action or proceeding.\n23. UNCLAIMED PROPERTY; DORMANCY CHARGES\nPlease be advised that if a customer has an outstanding account balance (a credit positive balance) for three (3) years or more for any reason, and (i) GoDaddy is unable to issue payment to such customer or (ii) GoDaddy issued payment to such customer in the form of a paper check, but the check was never cashed, then GoDaddy shall turn over such account balance to the State of Arizona in accordance with state law.\u00a0 You acknowledge and agree that in either case (i) or (ii) above, GoDaddy may withhold a dormancy charge in an amount equal to the lesser of $25.00 or the total outstanding account balance associated with such customer.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n24. SUCCESSORS AND ASSIGNS\nThis Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective heirs, successors and assigns.\n25.

We begrijpen dat dit een grote verantwoordelijkheid is en werken er hard aan om uw gegevens te beschermen en u er de controle over te geven.Dit privacybeleid is bedoeld om u inzicht te geven in de gegevens die we verzamelen, waarom we deze gegevens verzamelen en hoe u deze gegevens kunt updaten, beheren, exporteren en verwijderen.Datum van inwerkingtreding 22 januari 2019 | Gearchiveerde versies | Pdf downloadenInleidingGegevens die Google verzameltWaarom Google gegevens verzameltUw privacyoptiesUw gegevens delenUw gegevens veilig houdenUw gegevens exporteren en verwijderenNaleving en samenwerking met regelgevende instantiesOver dit beleidGerelateerde privacyproceduresWe bouwen een reeks services waarmee miljoenen mensen dagelijks de wereld op nieuwe manieren kunnen verkennen en er interactie mee kunnen hebben. Onze services bestaan onder meer uit:---Google-applicaties, -sites en -apparaten, zoals Zoeken, YouTube en Google Home;---platforms, zoals de Chrome-browser en het Android-besturingssysteem;---producten die zijn ge\u00efntegreerd in apps en sites van derden, zoals advertenties en ingesloten Google Maps.U kunt onze services op vele verschillende manieren gebruiken om uw privacy te beheren. U kunt zich bijvoorbeeld aanmelden voor een Google-account als u content (zoals e-mails en foto's) wilt maken en beheren of als u relevantere zoekresultaten wilt krijgen. U kunt veel Google-services ook gebruiken als u bent uitgelogd of zonder \u00fcberhaupt een account te maken, zoals zoeken op Google of YouTube-video's bekijken. U kunt er ook voor kiezen priv\u00e9 te browsen op het web via Chrome in de incognitomodus. In al onze services kunt u uw privacyinstellingen aanpassen om te beheren wat we verzamelen en hoe uw gegevens worden gebruikt.We willen alles graag zo duidelijk mogelijk uitleggen en daarom hebben we voorbeelden, video's met uitleg en definities toegevoegd voor belangrijke termen. Als u vragen heeft over dit privacybeleid, kunt u contact met ons opnemen.We willen dat u inzicht krijgt in de typen gegevens die we verzamelen wanneer u onze services gebruikt.We verzamelen gegevens om betere services te kunnen leveren aan al onze gebruikers, van het vaststellen van basisinformatie (zoals de taal die u spreekt) tot meer complexe aspecten, zoals welke advertenties u het nuttigst vindt, welke mensen online het belangrijkst voor u zijn of welke YouTube-video's u mogelijk leuk vindt. De gegevens die Google verzamelt en de manier waarop die gegevens worden gebruikt, zijn afhankelijk van de manier waarop u onze services gebruikt en hoe u de privacyopties beheert.Als u niet bent ingelogd op een Google-account, slaan we de gegevens die we verzamelen op met unieke ID's die zijn gekoppeld aan de browser of de app die of het apparaat dat u gebruikt. Zo kunnen we bijvoorbeeld tijdens verschillende browsesessies onthouden wat uw taalvoorkeuren zijn.Wanneer u bent ingelogd, verzamelen we ook gegevens die we opslaan in uw Google-account en die we behandelen als persoonlijke gegevens.Wanneer u een Google-account maakt, verstrekt u persoonlijke gegevens aan ons, zoals uw naam en een wachtwoord. U kunt er ook voor kiezen een telefoonnummer of betalingsgegevens toe te voegen aan uw account. Zelfs als u niet bent ingelogd op een Google-account kunt u ervoor kiezen ons gegevens te verstrekken, zoals een e-mailadres om updates over onze services te ontvangen.We verzamelen ook de content die u maakt, uploadt of van anderen ontvangt wanneer u onze services gebruikt. Dit zijn onder meer de e-mails die u schrijft en ontvangt, foto's en video's die u opslaat, documenten en spreadsheets die u maakt en reacties die u achterlaat bij YouTube-video's.We verzamelen informatie over de apps, browsers en apparaten die u gebruikt om toegang te krijgen tot Google-services, waardoor we betere functies kunnen aanbieden, zoals automatische productupdates en het dimmen van uw scherm als uw batterij leeg raakt.De gegevens die we verzamelen, bestaan onder meer uit unieke ID's, het browsertype en de instellingen ervan, het besturingssysteem, informatie over het mobiele netwerk (waaronder de naam van de provider en het telefoonnummer) en het versienummer van apps. We verzamelen ook informatie over de interactie van uw applicaties, browsers en apparaten met onze services, waaronder IP-adressen, crashrapporten, systeemactiviteit en de datum, tijd en verwijzende URL van uw verzoek.We verzamelen deze gegevens wanneer een Google-service op uw apparaat contact opneemt met onze servers, bijvoorbeeld wanneer u een app installeert uit de Play Store of wanneer een service controleert op updates of deze ontvangt. Als u een Android-apparaat met Google-apps gebruikt, neemt uw apparaat periodiek contact op met Google-servers om informatie te verstrekken over uw apparaat en verbinding met onze services. Deze informatie bestaat onder meer uit het apparaattype, de naam van de provider, crashrapporten en welke apps u heeft ge\u00efnstalleerd.We verzamelen gegevens over uw activiteiten op onze services, die we gebruiken om bijvoorbeeld een YouTube-video aan te raden die u mogelijk leuk vindt. De activiteitsgegevens die we verzamelen, kunnen onder meer bestaan uit:---termen waarnaar u zoekt;---video's die u bekijkt;---weergaven van en interacties met content en advertenties;---spraak- en audiogegevens als u audiofuncties gebruikt;---aankoopactiviteiten;---mensen met wie u communiceert of met wie u content deelt;---activiteiten op sites en apps van derden die gebruikmaken van onze services;---browsegeschiedenis op Chrome die u heeft gesynchroniseerd met uw Google-account.Als u onze services gebruikt om oproepen te plaatsen en te ontvangen of sms'jes te verzenden en te ontvangen, kunnen we telefoonlogbestandsgegevens gebruiken, zoals uw telefoonnummer, door u gebelde nummers, nummers waardoor u gebeld wordt, doorschakelnummers, tijd en datum van oproepen en berichten, duur van oproepen, routeringsinformatie en oproeptypen.U kunt naar uw Google-account gaan voor informatie over en het beheer van activiteitsgegevens die zijn opgeslagen in uw account.Naar Google-accountWe verzamelen gegevens over uw locatie wanneer u onze services gebruikt. Daardoor kunnen we u functies aanbieden zoals een routebeschrijving voor uw weekendje weg of de aanvangstijden van films in een bioscoop bij u in de buurt.Uw locatie kan met een verschillende mate van nauwkeurigheid worden bepaald door:---gps;---IP-adres---sensorgegevens van uw apparaat.---informatie over zaken in de buurt van uw apparaat, zoals wifi-toegangspunten, zendmasten en Bluetooth-apparatenDe soorten locatiegegevens die we verzamelen, zijn deels afhankelijk van uw apparaat- en accountinstellingen. U kunt bijvoorbeeld de locatie van uw Android-apparaat in- of uitschakelen via de instellingen app van het apparaat. U kunt ook Locatiegeschiedenis inschakelen als u een priv\u00e9kaart wilt maken van waar u naartoe gaat met de apparaten waarbij u bent ingelogd.In sommige omstandigheden verzamelt Google ook gegevens over u via openbaar toegankelijke bronnen. Als bijvoorbeeld uw naam wordt vermeld in de lokale krant, kan de zoekmachine van Google dat artikel indexeren en weergeven aan anderen als ze op uw naam zoeken. We kunnen ook gegevens over u verzamelen die afkomstig zijn van vertrouwde partners, waaronder marketingpartners die ons informatie verstrekken over potenti\u00eble klanten of onze zakelijke services en beveiligingspartners die ons informatie verstrekken om te beschermen tegen misbruik. We ontvangen ook informatie van adverteerders om namens hen advertenties en onderzoeksservices te bieden.We gebruiken verschillende technologie\u00ebn om gegevens te verzamelen en op te slaan, waaronder cookies, pixeltags, lokale webopslag, zoals browserwebopslag of gegevenscaches van apps, databases en serverlogbestanden.We gebruiken gegevens om betere services te ontwikkelenWe gebruiken de gegevens die we op al onze services verzamelen voor de volgende doeleinden:We gebruiken uw gegevens om onze services te leveren, zoals de verwerking van de termen waarnaar u zoekt om resultaten weer te geven of om u te helpen content te delen door ontvangers uit uw contacten voor te stellen.We gebruiken uw gegevens ook om ervoor te zorgen dat onze services werken zoals de bedoeling is, bijvoorbeeld door storingen bij te houden of problemen op te lossen die u aan ons rapporteert. We gebruiken uw gegevens ook om verbeteringen door te voeren in onze services. Zo helpt inzicht in zoektermen die vaak verkeerd worden gespeld ons bijvoorbeeld bij de verbetering van functies voor spellingcontrole in onze services.We gebruiken de gegevens die we in bestaande services verzamelen om ons te helpen bij de ontwikkeling van nieuwe services. Het inzicht dat we bijvoorbeeld kregen in de manier waarop mensen hun foto's organiseerden in Picasa (de eerste foto-app van Google), hielp ons bij het ontwerp en de introductie van Google Foto's.We gebruiken de gegevens die we verzamelen om onze services voor u aan te passen, onder andere door aanbevelingen te doen, gepersonaliseerde content te bieden en aangepaste zoekresultaten weer te geven. Zo biedt de Beveiligingscheck bijvoorbeeld beveiligingstips die zijn aangepast aan de manier waarop u Google-producten gebruikt. En Google Play gebruikt gegevens zoals apps die u al heeft ge\u00efnstalleerd en video's die u heeft bekeken op YouTube om u suggesties te doen voor nieuwe apps die u mogelijk interessant vindt.Afhankelijk van uw instellingen kunnen we u ook gepersonaliseerde advertenties laten zien op basis van uw interesses. Als u bijvoorbeeld zoekt naar 'mountainbikes', kunt u een advertentie te zien krijgen voor sportmateriaal wanneer u een site bekijkt waarop advertenties van Google worden weergegeven. U bepaalt via uw advertentie-instellingen welke gegevens we gebruiken om u advertenties te laten zien.---We laten geen gepersonaliseerde advertenties zien op basis van gevoelige categorie\u00ebn, zoals ras, religie, seksuele geaardheid of gezondheid.---We delen geen gegevens waarmee u persoonlijk ge\u00efdentificeerd kunt worden door adverteerders, zoals uw naam of e-mailadres, tenzij u ons hierom verzoekt. Als u bijvoorbeeld een advertentie ziet voor een bloemenzaak bij u in de buurt en de knop 'Tik om te bellen' selecteert, verbinden we uw oproep door en kunnen we uw telefoonnummer delen met de bloemenzaak.Ga naar Advertentie-instellingenWe gebruiken gegevens voor analyses en metingen om inzicht te krijgen in de manier waarop onze services worden gebruikt. Zo analyseren we bijvoorbeeld gegevens over uw bezoeken aan onze sites om zo onder meer het productontwerp te optimaliseren. We gebruiken ook gegevens over de advertenties waarmee u interactie heeft om adverteerders inzicht te bieden in de prestaties van hun advertentiecampagnes. Hiervoor gebruiken we verschillende tools, waaronder Google Analytics. Wanneer u een site bezoekt die gebruikmaakt van Google Analytics, kunnen Google en een Google Analytics-klant gegevens over uw activiteiten op die site linken met activiteiten op andere sites die gebruikmaken van onze advertentieservices.We gebruiken gegevens die we verzamelen (zoals uw e-mailadres) om rechtstreeks met u te communiceren. We kunnen u bijvoorbeeld een melding sturen als we verdachte activiteiten constateren, zoals een poging om vanaf een ongebruikelijke locatie in te loggen op uw Google-account. We kunnen u ook informeren over aanstaande veranderingen of verbeteringen van onze services. En als u contact opneemt met Google, houden we gegevens over uw verzoek bij om u te helpen eventuele problemen op te lossen.We gebruiken informatie om de veiligheid en betrouwbaarheid van onze services te helpen verbeteren. Dit omvat onder meer het detecteren en voorkomen van en reageren op fraude, misbruik, beveiligingsrisico's en technische problemen die schade kunnen veroorzaken bij Google, onze gebruikers of het publiek.We maken gebruik van verschillende technologie\u00ebn om uw gegevens voor deze doeleinden te verwerken. We gebruiken geautomatiseerde systemen die uw content analyseren om bijvoorbeeld aangepaste zoekresultaten, gepersonaliseerde advertenties of andere functies te bieden die zijn aangepast aan de manier waarop u onze services gebruikt. En we analyseren uw content om ons te helpen misbruik te detecteren, zoals spam, malware en illegale content. We maken ook gebruik van algoritmen om patronen in gegevens te herkennen. Google Translate helpt bijvoorbeeld mensen in verschillende talen te communiceren door veelvoorkomende taalpatronen te detecteren in zinnen die u laat vertalen.We kunnen de gegevens combineren die we verzamelen via onze services en op verschillende apparaten en deze gebruiken voor de hierboven beschreven doeleinden. Als u bijvoorbeeld video's van gitaarspelers bekijkt op YouTube, krijgt u mogelijk een advertentie te zien voor gitaarlessen op een site die onze advertentieproducten gebruikt. Afhankelijk van uw accountinstellingen kan uw activiteit op andere sites en in andere apps worden gekoppeld aan uw persoonlijke gegevens om de services van Google en de door Google geleverde advertenties te verbeteren.Als andere gebruikers al beschikken over uw e-mailadres of andere gegevens waarmee u kunt worden ge\u00efdentificeerd, kunnen we aan deze gebruikers uw openbaar zichtbare Google-accountgegevens weergeven, zoals uw naam en foto. Daardoor kunnen mensen bijvoorbeeld aan een e-mail zien dat deze van u afkomstig is.We vragen om uw toestemming voordat we uw gegevens gebruiken voor een doeleinde dat niet in dit privacybeleid wordt beschreven.U beschikt over keuzes met betrekking tot de gegevens die we verzamelen en hoe deze worden gebruiktIn dit gedeelte worden de belangrijkste opties beschreven waarmee u uw privacy kunt beheren in onze services. U kunt ook de Privacycheck doen, waarbij u belangrijke privacyinstellingen kunt bekijken en aanpassen. In aanvulling op deze tools bieden we ook specifieke privacyinstellingen in onze producten. Meer informatie hierover vindt u in onze privacyhandleiding voor producten.Naar de PrivacycheckWanneer u bent ingelogd, kunt u altijd uw gegevens bekijken en updaten door naar de services te gaan die u gebruikt. Foto's en Drive zijn bijvoorbeeld beide ontworpen om u te helpen specifieke soorten content te beheren die u via Google heeft opgeslagen.We hebben ook een plek ingebouwd waar u gegevens kunt bekijken en controleren die u heeft opgeslagen in uw Google-account. Uw Google-account bevat onder meer:Besluit welke typen activiteiten u wilt opslaan in uw account. U kunt bijvoorbeeld Locatiegeschiedenis inschakelen als u verkeersprognoses wilt voor uw dagelijkse route van en naar het werk of u kunt uw YouTube-kijkgeschiedenis opslaan om betere videosuggesties te krijgen.Ga naar ActiviteitsoptiesBeheer uw voorkeuren over advertenties die aan u worden weergegeven op Google en op sites en apps die samenwerken met Google om advertenties weer te geven. U kunt uw interesses aanpassen, kiezen of uw persoonlijke gegevens worden gebruikt om advertenties relevanter voor u te maken en bepaalde advertentieservices in- en uitschakelen.Ga naar Advertentie-instellingenGegevens beheren die andere gebruikers over u te zien krijgen in Google-services.Naar 'Over u'Kies of uw naam en foto worden weergegeven naast uw activiteiten, zoals recensies en aanbevelingen, die worden weergegeven in advertenties.Naar 'Aanbevelingen uit uw kringen'Beheer met wie u gegevens deelt via uw account op Google+.Naar 'Gegevens die u deelt'Met 'Mijn activiteit' kunt u gegevens bekijken en controleren die worden gemaakt wanneer u Google-services gebruikt, zoals zoekopdrachten die u heeft uitgevoerd of uw bezoeken aan Google Play. U kunt browsen op datum en op onderwerp en uw activiteiten gedeeltelijk of volledig verwijderen.Naar 'Mijn activiteit'Met Google Dashboard kunt u gegevens beheren die aan specifieke producten zijn gekoppeld.Naar 'Dashboard'Beheer uw contactgegevens, zoals uw naam, e-mailadres en telefoonnummer.Naar 'Persoonlijke gegevens'Als u bent uitgelogd, kunt u gegevens beheren die aan uw browser of apparaat zijn gekoppeld, waaronder de volgende gegevenstypen:---Personalisatie van zoekresultaten als u bent uitgelogd: Selecteer of uw zoekactiviteiten worden gebruikt om u relevantere resultaten en aanbevelingen te tonen.---Instellingen voor YouTube: Pauzeer en verwijder uw YouTube-zoekgeschiedenis en uw YouTube-kijkgeschiedenis.---Advertentie-instellingen: Beheer uw voorkeuren voor de advertenties die aan u worden getoond op Google en op sites en in apps die samenwerken met Google voor weergave van advertenties.U kunt een kopie van de content in uw Google-account exporteren als u hier een reservekopie van wilt maken of de content wilt gebruiken in een service buiten Google.Uw gegevens exporterenU kunt ook verzoeken om verwijdering van content van specifieke Google-services op basis van de toepasselijke wetgeving.Als u uw gegevens wilt verwijderen, kunt u het volgende doen:---Uw content verwijderen uit specifieke Google-services.---Specifieke items zoeken en deze vervolgens verwijderen uit uw account via Mijn activiteit.---Specifieke Google-producten verwijderen, waaronder uw gegevens die aan deze producten zijn gekoppeld.---Uw gehele Google-account verwijderen.Uw gegevens verwijderen.En tot slot kunt u via Inactiviteitsvoorkeuren iemand anders toegang verlenen tot delen van uw Google-account als u onverwacht niet in staat bent uw account te gebruiken.Er zijn andere manieren om te controleren welke gegevens Google verzamelt, ongeacht of u bent ingelogd op een Google-account. U kunt dit onder andere op de volgende plaatsen doen:---Browserinstellingen: U kunt uw browser bijvoorbeeld zodanig configureren dat een melding wordt weergegeven wanneer Google een cookie heeft ingesteld in uw browser. U kunt uw browser ook zodanig configureren dat alle cookies van een specifiek domein of van alle domeinen worden geblokkeerd. Denk er echter aan dat onze services cookies nodig hebben om naar behoren te functioneren, bijvoorbeeld voor zaken als het onthouden van uw taalvoorkeuren.---Instellingen op apparaatniveau: Uw apparaat kan beschikken over opties waarmee u kunt bepalen welke gegevens we verzamelen. U kunt bijvoorbeeld locatie-instellingen wijzigen op uw Android-apparaat.In veel van onze services kunt u gegevens delen met andere mensen en zelf bepalen hoe u deze gegevens deelt. U kunt bijvoorbeeld video's openbaar delen op YouTube of u kunt ervoor kiezen uw video's priv\u00e9 te houden. Denk eraan dat als u gegevens openbaar deelt, uw content toegankelijk kan worden via zoekmachines, waaronder Google Zoeken.Wanneer u bent ingelogd op en interactie heeft met bepaalde Google-services, zoals wanneer u reacties achterlaat bij een YouTube-video of een nummer beoordeelt in Play, worden uw naam en foto weergegeven naast uw activiteit. We kunnen deze gegevens ook weergeven in advertenties, afhankelijk van uw instellingen in 'Aanbevelingen uit uw kringen'.We delen persoonlijke gegevens niet met bedrijven, organisaties en individuen buiten Google, behalve in de volgende gevallen:We delen persoonlijke informatie buiten Google als we uw toestemming hebben. Als u bijvoorbeeld een Google Home gebruikt om een reservering te maken via een boekingsservice, krijgen we uw toestemming voordat we uw naam of telefoonnummer delen met het restaurant. We vragen om uw uitdrukkelijke toestemming voordat we gevoelige persoonlijke informatie delen.Als u student bent of werkt voor een organisatie die gebruikmaakt van Google-services (zoals G Suite), hebben uw domeinbeheerder en resellers die uw account beheren toegang tot uw Google-account. Ze kunnen mogelijk het volgende doen:---Informatie bekijken en bewaren die is opgeslagen in uw account, zoals uw e-mail.---Statistieken over uw account bekijken, zoals bijvoorbeeld hoeveel apps u installeert.---Uw accountwachtwoord wijzigen.---De toegang tot uw account opschorten of be\u00ebindigen.---Uw accountgegevens ontvangen om te voldoen aan de van toepassing zijnde wet- en regelgeving, wettelijke procedures of verzoeken van overheidsinstanties.---Uw mogelijkheden beperken om uw gegevens te verwijderen of te bewerken of uw privacyinstellingen aan te passen.We leveren persoonlijke gegevens aan onze partners en andere vertrouwde bedrijven of individuen zodat ze de gegevens voor ons kunnen verwerken, op basis van onze instructies en in overeenstemming met ons privacybeleid en andere passende vertrouwelijkheids- en beveiligingsmaatregelen. We maken bijvoorbeeld gebruik van dienstverleners om ons te helpen met klantenondersteuning.We delen persoonlijke gegevens buiten Google als we te goeder trouw van mening zijn dat toegang, gebruik, behoud of openbaarmaking van de gegevens redelijkerwijs nodig is om:---te voldoen aan de van toepassing zijnde wet- en regelgeving, wettelijke procedures of verzoeken van overheidsinstanties. We delen informatie over het aantal en het soort verzoeken dat we van overheden ontvangen in ons Transparantierapport;---de van toepassing zijnde Servicevoorwaarden af te dwingen, waaronder het onderzoeken van mogelijke schendingen;---fraude en technische of beveiligingsproblemen te detecteren, te voorkomen of anderszins aan te pakken;---de rechten, eigendom of veiligheid van Google, onze gebruikers of het publiek te beschermen, zoals vereist of toegestaan volgens de wet.We kunnen niet-persoonlijke gegevens openbaar delen en met onze partners, zoals uitgevers, adverteerders, ontwikkelaars of houders van rechten. We delen gegevens bijvoorbeeld openbaar om trends te laten zien voor het algemene gebruik van onze services. We staan ook specifieke partners toe gegevens te verzamelen uit uw browser of van uw apparaat voor advertentie- en meetdoeleinden via hun eigen cookies of soortgelijke technologie\u00ebn.Als Google betrokken is bij een fusie, overname of verkoop van activa, blijven we de vertrouwelijkheid van uw persoonlijke gegevens waarborgen en stellen we de betreffende gebruikers op de hoogte voordat persoonlijke gegevens worden overgedragen of onderworpen aan een ander privacybeleid.We bouwen veiligheid in onze services in om uw gegevens te beschermenAlle Google-producten zijn voorzien van sterke beveiligingsfuncties die uw gegevens voortdurend beschermen. Het inzicht dat we verkrijgen bij het onderhoud van onze services, helpt veiligheidsdreigingen te detecteren en automatisch te blokkeren, zodat deze u nooit bereiken.

We kunnen ook uw IP-adres gebruiken om uw locatie bij benadering te bepalen, zodat we u advertenties kunnen tonen voor een pizzabezorgservice in de buurt als u naar 'pizza' zoekt. Meer informatie over Google-advertenties en waarom u bepaalde advertenties te zien kunt krijgen.Als u bijvoorbeeld een adres typt in het veld Aan, Cc of Bcc van een e-mail die u opstelt, stelt Gmail adressen voor op basis van de mensen waar u het vaakst contact mee heeft.Als u uw telefoonnummer toevoegt aan uw account, kan dit worden gebruikt voor verschillende doeleinden in Google-services, afhankelijk van uw instellingen. Uw telefoonnummer kan bijvoorbeeld worden gebruikt om u te helpen toegang te krijgen tot uw account als u uw wachtwoord vergeet, om mensen te helpen u te vinden en contact te leggen en om de advertenties die u ziet relevanter voor u te maken. Meer informatieAls u bijvoorbeeld een creditcard of andere betaalmethode toevoegt aan uw Google-account, kunt u deze gebruiken om items te kopen via onze services, zoals apps in de Play Store. We kunnen ook vragen om andere gegevens, zoals uw btw-nummer om uw betaling te helpen verwerken. In sommige gevallen moeten we ook uw identiteit verifi\u00ebren en kunnen we vragen om gegevens waarmee we dat kunnen doen.We kunnen ook betalingsgegevens gebruiken om te verifi\u00ebren of u voldoet aan leeftijdsvereisten, als u bijvoorbeeld een onjuiste geboortedatum invoert waaruit blijkt dat u niet oud genoeg bent om een Google-account te hebben. Meer informatieWe kunnen gegevens van uw apparaten bijvoorbeeld gebruiken om u te helpen besluiten welk apparaat u wilt gebruiken om een app te installeren of een film te kopen op Google Play. We kunnen deze gegevens ook gebruiken om u te helpen uw account te beschermen.Android-apparaten met Google-apps omvatten apparaten die worden verkocht door Google of een van onze partners en zijn onder meer telefoons, camera's, voertuigen, wearables en televisies. Deze apparaten maken gebruik van Google Play-services en andere vooraf ge\u00efnstalleerde apps die services omvatten zoals Gmail, Maps, de camera en telefoonkiezer van uw telefoon, tekst-naar-spraakomzetting, toetsenbordinvoer en beveiligingsfuncties.We verzamelen bijvoorbeeld informatie over weergaven van en interactie met advertenties, zodat we totaalrapporten kunnen verstrekken aan adverteerders en hun kunnen laten weten of we hun advertentie op een pagina hebben weergegeven en of de advertentie waarschijnlijk door een kijker is gezien. We kunnen ook andere interacties meten, zoals hoe u uw muis over een advertentie beweegt en of u iets heeft gedaan met de pagina waarop de advertentie werd weergegeven.Uw Chrome-browsegeschiedenis wordt alleen in uw account opgeslagen als u Chrome-synchronisatie voor uw Google-account heeft ingeschakeld. Meer informatieVoorbeelden van deze services zijn onder meer:---Google Hangouts, voor het uitvoeren van nationale en internationale oproepen---Google Voice, voor het uitvoeren van oproepen, verzending van sms-berichten en beheer van voicemail---Google Fi, voor een telefoonabonnementUw apparaat kan over sensoren beschikken die kunnen worden gebruikt om beter inzicht te krijgen in uw locatie en verplaatsingen. Een versnellingsmeter kan bijvoorbeeld worden gebruikt om uw snelheid te bepalen en een gyroscoop om de reisrichting te bepalen.Als u gebruikmaakt van de locatieservices van Google op Android, kunnen we de prestaties van apps verbeteren die gebruikmaken van uw locatie, zoals Google Maps. Als u de locatieservices van Google gebruikt, verzendt uw apparaat informatie naar Google over zijn locatie, sensoren (zoals de versnellingsmeter) en zendmasten en wifi-toegangspunten (zoals MAC-adres en signaalsterkte) in de buurt. Al deze signalen helpen uw locatie te bepalen. U kunt uw apparaatinstellingen gebruiken om de locatieservices van Google in te schakelen. Meer informatieWe kunnen bijvoorbeeld informatie verzamelen die online openbaar beschikbaar is of die afkomstig is van andere openbare bronnen om taalmodellen van Google te helpen trainen en functies zoals Google Translate uit te bouwen.Informatie over bijvoorbeeld beveiligingsdreigingen kan ons helpen u te informeren als wij vermoeden dat uw account gevaar loopt (waarna we u kunnen helpen stappen te nemen om uw account te beschermen).Adverteerders kunnen bijvoorbeeld gegevens uploaden die afkomstig zijn van hun klantenkaartprogramma, zodat ze beter inzicht krijgen in de prestaties van hun advertentiecampagnes. We verstrekken alleen totaalrapporten aan adverteerders die geen informatie bevatten over afzonderlijke mensen.Voorbeelden van hoe we uw gegevens gebruiken om onze services te leveren:---We gebruiken het aan uw apparaat toegewezen IP-adres om u de gegevens te sturen waarom u heeft verzocht, zoals het laden van een YouTube-video.---We maken gebruik van unieke ID's die zijn opgeslagen in cookies op uw apparaat om ons te helpen u te verifi\u00ebren als de persoon die toegang mag krijgen tot uw Google-account.---Foto's en video's die u uploadt naar Google Foto's, worden gebruikt om albums, animaties en andere creaties te maken die u kunt delen. Meer informatie---Een bevestigingsmail voor een vlucht kan worden gebruikt om een knop Inchecken te maken die wordt weergegeven in uw Gmail.---Wanneer u services of fysieke producten bij ons koopt, kunt u informatie aan ons verstrekken zoals uw verzendadres of bezorginstructies. We gebruiken deze gegevens onder meer voor het verwerken, uitvoeren en bezorgen van uw bestelling en om ondersteuning te bieden voor het product dat of de service die u koopt.We houden onze systemen bijvoorbeeld voortdurend in de gaten om problemen te signaleren. En als we constateren dat er iets mis is met een specifieke functie, kunnen we de functie sneller repareren door activiteitsinformatie te bekijken die is verzameld voordat het probleem optrad.We gebruiken bijvoorbeeld cookies om te analyseren hoe mensen onze services gebruiken. Die analyse helpt ons weer om betere producten te maken. Zo kunnen we er bijvoorbeeld achter komen dat het te lang duurt voordat mensen een bepaalde taak kunnen voltooien of dat ze \u00fcberhaupt problemen hebben om alle stappen te voltooien. Vervolgens kunnen we die functie opnieuw ontwerpen en het product zo voor iedereen verbeteren.Als u bijvoorbeeld bent ingelogd op uw Google-account en de optie 'Web- en app-activiteit' heeft ingeschakeld, kunt u relevantere zoekresultaten te zien krijgen die zijn gebaseerd op uw eerdere zoekopdrachten en activiteiten in andere Google-services. Meer informatie vindt u hier. U kunt ook aangepaste zoekresultaten ontvangen wanneer u bent uitgelogd. Als u geen prijs stelt op dit niveau van aangepast zoeken, kunt u priv\u00e9 zoeken en browsen of personalisatie van zoekresultaten als u bent uitgelogd uitschakelen.U kunt ook gepersonaliseerde advertenties zien op basis van informatie van de adverteerder. Als u bijvoorbeeld heeft gewinkeld op de website van een adverteerder, kan die deze informatie gebruiken om u advertenties te tonen. Meer informatieBij de weergave van gepersonaliseerde advertenties gebruiken we onderwerpen waarvan wij denken dat u deze interessant vindt op basis van uw activiteiten. U kunt bijvoorbeeld advertenties zien voor koken en recepten of voor vliegreizen. We gebruiken geen onderwerpen en laten geen gepersonaliseerde advertenties zien op basis van gevoelige categorie\u00ebn, zoals ras, religie, seksuele geaardheid of gezondheid. En we eisen dit ook van de adverteerders die onze services gebruiken.Google Analytics maakt gebruik van eigen cookies, wat inhoudt dat de cookies worden ingesteld door de klant van Google Analytics. Met behulp van onze systemen kunnen gegevens die via Google Analytics zijn gegenereerd, door de Google Analytics-klant en door Google aan cookies van derden worden gelinkt die verband houden met bezoeken aan andere websites. Zo wil een adverteerder mogelijk zijn Google Analytics-gegevens gebruiken om relevantere advertenties te maken of om zijn verkeer verder te analyseren. Meer informatieEnkele voorbeelden van hoe we uw gegevens gebruiken om onze services veilig en betrouwbaar te houden:---De verzameling en analyse van IP-adressen en cookiegegevens om te beschermen tegen automatisch misbruik. Dit misbruik neemt vele vormen aan, waaronder verzending van spam naar Gmail-gebruikers, het stelen van geld van adverteerders door middel van frauduleuze klikken op advertenties of censurering van content door middel van een DDoS-aanval (Distributed Denial of Service).---Met behulp van de functie 'Laatste accountactiviteit' in Gmail kun u achterhalen of en wanneer iemand zonder dat u het wist toegang heeft gehad tot uw e-mail. Deze functie laat u informatie zien over recente activiteit in Gmail, zoals de IP-adressen die toegang hebben gehad tot uw e-mail, plus de bijbehorende locatie, datum en tijd van die toegang. Meer informatieWanneer we spam, malware, illegale content en andere vormen van misbruik die ons beleid schenden, detecteren op onze systemen, kunnen we uw account uitschakelen of passende actie ondernemen. Onder bepaalde omstandigheden kunnen we de schending ook melden bij de bevoegde autoriteiten.Enkele voorbeelden van hoe we de door ons verzamelde informatie combineren:---Als u bent ingelogd op uw Google-account en een zoekopdracht uitvoert op Google, kunt u zoekresultaten van het openbare internet zien, samen met relevante informatie uit de content die u heeft in andere Google-producten, zoals Gmail of Google Agenda. Hierbij kunt u denken aan de status van een aanstaande vlucht, restaurant- en hotelreserveringen of uw foto's. Meer informatie---Als u met iemand heeft gecommuniceerd via Gmail en deze persoon wilt toevoegen aan een Google-document of een afspraak in Google Agenda, maakt Google dit gemakkelijk door zijn of haar e-mailadres automatisch aan te vullen wanneer u de naam begint te typen. Deze functie maakt het makkelijker om content of informatie te delen met mensen die u kent. Meer informatie---De Google-app kan gegevens gebruiken die u heeft opgeslagen in andere Google-producten om u gepersonaliseerde content te tonen, afhankelijk van uw instellingen. Als u bijvoorbeeld zoekopdrachten heeft opgeslagen in uw Web- en app-activiteit, kan de Google-app u nieuwsartikelen en andere informatie laten zien over uw interesses, zoals sportuitslagen, op basis van uw activiteit. Meer informatie---Als u uw Google-account aan Google Home linkt, kunt u gegevens beheren en zaken regelen via de Google Assistent. U kunt bijvoorbeeld afspraken toevoegen aan uw Google-agenda of uw planning voor de dag ontvangen, vragen om statusupdates voor uw volgende vlucht of informatie zoals een routebeschrijving naar uw telefoon verzenden. Meer informatieDeze activiteit kan afkomstig zijn uit uw gebruik van Google-services zoals de synchronisatie van uw account met Chrome of van uw bezoeken aan sites en apps die samenwerken met Google. Veel websites en apps werken samen met Google om hun content en services te verbeteren. Een website kan bijvoorbeeld gebruikmaken van onze advertentieservices (zoals AdSense) of analysetools (zoals Google Analytics), of er kan andere content (zoals video's van YouTube) op de website zijn ingesloten. Deze services delen informatie over uw activiteit met Google. Afhankelijk van uw accountinstellingen en de gebruikte producten (bijvoorbeeld wanneer een partner Google Analytics gebruikt in combinatie met onze advertentieservices) kunnen deze gegevens aan uw persoonlijke gegevens worden gekoppeld.Meer informatie over hoe Google gegevens gebruikt wanneer u sites of apps van onze partners gebruikt.Er zijn meer dan twee miljoen externe websites en apps die samenwerken met Google voor de weergave van advertenties. Meer informatieU kunt bijvoorbeeld uw blog verwijderen van Blogger of een Google-site waarvan u de eigenaar bent verwijderen van Google Sites. U kunt ook reviews verwijderen die u heeft achtergelaten voor apps, games en andere content in de Play Store.We gebruiken bijvoorbeeld de cookie 'lbcs' waarmee u veel Google-documenten in \u00e9\u00e9n browser kunt openen. Als deze cookie wordt geblokkeerd, kan het zijn dat Google Documenten niet werkt zoals verwacht. Meer informatieNet zoals andere technologie- en communicatiebedrijven ontvangt Google regelmatig verzoeken van overheden en rechtbanken van over de hele wereld om gebruikersgegevens openbaar te maken. Respect voor de privacy en beveiliging van de gegevens die u opslaat bij Google, typeert de manier waarop we omgaan met deze juridische verzoeken. Ons juridische team controleert elk verzoek, ongeacht het type, en we dienen regelmatig bezwaar in als een verzoek te breed is of niet de juiste procedure volgt. U kunt meer informatie vinden in ons Transparantierapport.Wanneer veel mensen naar hetzelfde gaan zoeken, kan dit nuttige informatie leveren over bepaalde actuele trends. Google Trends analyseert Google-zoekopdrachten om de populariteit van zoekopdrachten tijdens een bepaalde periode te schatten. Die resultaten worden vervolgens in verzamelde vorm openbaar gedeeld. Meer informatieWe staan bijvoorbeeld YouTube-videomakers en adverteerders toe om samen te werken met meetbureaus om meer informatie te krijgen over de doelgroep van hun YouTube-video's of advertenties met behulp van cookies of soortgelijke technologie\u00ebn. Een ander voorbeeld zijn verkopers op onze winkelpagina's, die cookies gebruiken om te ontdekken hoeveel verschillende gebruikers hun productvermeldingen hebben gezien. Meer informatie over deze partners en hoe ze uw gegevens gebruiken.We maken bijvoorbeeld gebruik van datacenters die zich over de hele wereld bevinden om onze producten voortdurend beschikbaar te stellen aan onze gebruikers.We verwerken uw gegevens bijvoorbeeld om gebruikersstatistieken te rapporteren aan de houders van rechten over hoe hun content is gebruikt in onze services. We kunnen uw gegevens ook verwerken als mensen naar uw naam zoeken en we zoekresultaten weergeven voor sites die openbaar beschikbare informatie over u bevatten.We kunnen bijvoorbeeld gegevens anonimiseren of versleutelen om te waarborgen dat deze niet aan andere informatie over u kunnen worden gekoppeld. Meer informatieWe analyseren bijvoorbeeld hoe mensen interactie hebben met advertenties om de prestaties van onze advertenties te verbeteren.We kunnen bijvoorbeeld een Google-doodle weergeven op de homepage van Google Zoeken om een gebeurtenis te vieren die specifiek is voor uw land.Een aangesloten entiteit is een entiteit die behoort tot de Google-groep van bedrijven, waaronder de volgende bedrijven die consumentenservices aanbieden in de EU: Google Ireland Limited, Google Commerce Ltd, Google Payment Corp en Google Dialer Inc.

Sommige functies of services van een website functioneren wellicht niet goed zonder cookies. Meer informatie over hoe Google cookies gebruikt en hoe Google gegevens (waaronder cookies) gebruikt wanneer u gebruikmaakt van sites of apps van onze partners.Een apparaat is een computer die kan worden gebruikt om toegang tot Google-services te krijgen. Desktopcomputers, tablets, slimme luidsprekers en smartphones worden bijvoorbeeld allemaal beschouwd als apparaten.Dit zijn gegevens over gebruikers die zodanig worden opgeslagen dat deze gegevens niet meer naar een individueel identificeerbare gebruiker verwijzen.Elk apparaat dat is verbonden met internet, krijgt een nummer toegewezen. Dit wordt een IP-adres (Internet Protocol) genoemd. Deze nummers worden gewoonlijk in geografische blokken toegewezen. Een IP-adres kan vaak gebruikt worden om de locatie te identificeren van waaruit een apparaat verbinding maakt met internet.Een pixeltag is een type technologie dat op een website of in het hoofdgedeelte van een e-mail wordt geplaatst om bepaalde activiteiten bij te houden, zoals de weergaven van een website of wanneer een e-mail wordt geopend. Pixeltags worden vaak gebruikt in combinatie met cookies.Dit is informatie die u aan ons verstrekt en waarmee u persoonlijk kunt worden ge\u00efdentificeerd, zoals uw naam, e-mailadres of factureringsgegevens of andere gegevens die redelijkerwijs aan dergelijke informatie kunnen worden gekoppeld door Google, zoals informatie die we koppelen aan uw Google-account.Dit is een specifieke categorie van persoonlijke gegevens met betrekking tot onderwerpen zoals vertrouwelijke medische feiten, ras of etnische afkomst, politieke of religieuze overtuigingen of seksualiteit.Net als de meeste websites slaan onze servers automatisch uw paginaverzoeken op onze sites op. Dergelijke \u2018serverlogbestanden\u2019 omvatten doorgaans informatie zoals uw zoekopdracht, IP-adres, browsertype, browsertaal, datum en tijd van uw zoekopdracht en een of meer cookies die uw browser kunnen herkennen.Een typisch serverlogbestand voor een zoekopdracht naar 'auto's' ziet er als volgt uit:123.45.67.89 - 25/Mar/2003 10:15:32 -http://www.google.com/search?q=cars -Firefox 1.0.7; Windows NT 5.1 -740674ce2123e969---123.45.67.89 is het IP-adres dat de gebruiker van zijn internetprovider toegewezen heeft gekregen.

When you use a credit or debit card with Apple\u00a0Pay we don\u2019t keep transaction information that can be tied back to you, so we can\u2019t create a history of your purchases. And when you use Apple\u00a0Pay Cash, information is stored only for fraud prevention, troubleshooting, and regulatory purposes. To make sure your credit card information is safe, a device-specific number is created and kept walled off from the rest of your iOS device. Neither Apple nor your device shares actual credit card numbers with merchants.\nWhen we use data to create better experiences for you, we work hard to do it in a way that doesn\u2019t compromise your privacy. One example is our pioneering use of Differential Privacy, where we scramble your data and combine it with the data of millions of others. So we see general patterns, rather than specifics that could be traced back to you. These patterns help us identify things like the most popular emoji, the best QuickType suggestions, and energy consumption rates in Safari.\nWhenever you buy groceries with Apple\u00a0Pay, send an iMessage to a friend, or make a FaceTime call, your data is encrypted for your protection. The same is true for the personal information that lives on your device. For example, the data used to identify you for Touch ID and Face ID is converted into mathematical representations that are encrypted and protected by the Secure Enclave on your device, where they cannot be accessed by iOS or apps. It isn\u2019t stored on Apple servers or backed up to iCloud.\nWe require app developers to agree to strict guidelines designed to protect your privacy. If we learn that an app violates these guidelines, the developer must address the issue or face removal from the App Store. If an app you\u2019ve installed on your device wants to access personal information like photos or contacts, you\u2019re prompted to give permission first. You can change these permissions whenever you want.\nOur approach to privacy\nLearn more\nManage your privacy\nLearn more\nTransparency report\nLearn more\n", "http://www.apple.com/legal/icloud/en/terms.html": "\nLegal - iCloud - Apple\nTHIS LEGAL AGREEMENT BETWEEN YOU AND APPLE GOVERNS YOUR USE OF THE iCLOUD PRODUCT, SOFTWARE, SERVICES, AND WEBSITES (COLLECTIVELY REFERRED TO AS THE \u201cSERVICE\u201d).

Entire AgreementThis Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between you and Apple, governs your use of the Service and completely replaces any prior agreements between you and Apple in relation to the Service.

If any part of this Agreement is held invalid or unenforceable, that portion shall be construed in a manner consistent with applicable law to reflect, as nearly as possible, the original intentions of the parties, and the remaining portions shall remain in full force and effect.

(\"IFTTT\") takes the private nature of your personal information very seriously. This Privacy Policy describes how we treat the information we collect when you visit and use the IFTTT website located at ifttt.com (the \"Site\") and the services offered by IFTTT (the Site, Mobile Apps, and services referred to as the \"Service\"). Please read this Privacy Policy to learn more about the ways in which IFTTT uses and protects your personal information. By using the Service you acknowledge and agree to be bound by the terms and conditions of this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree to the terms, please do not use the Service or access our Site.\n  \n  The IFTTT Service is not intended for use by children. If you are under 18, you may use the Service only with involvement of a parent or guardian. We do not knowingly collect or solicit personal information from anyone under the age of 16. If you are under 16, please do not attempt to register for the Services or send any personal information about yourself to us. If we learn that we have collected personal information from a child under age 16, we will delete that information as quickly as possible. If you believe that a child under 16 may have provided us personal information, please contact us at privacy@ifttt.com.\n  \nInformation We Collect Automatically\n  Browsing the Site does not require you to register for an account or provide any personal information to us. In general, IFTTT will gather some generic information automatically. This generic information may include the internet address assigned to your computer, the number and frequency of visitors to the Site, the URL that you just came from (whether this URL is on the Site or not), which URL you next go to (whether this URL is on the Site or not), and your computer browser information. Generic information does not reveal the identity of the visitor. This type of aggregate data may enable us to figure out how often users use parts of the Service, help us determine customer service and Site needs, and do internal research on our users' demographics, interests, and behavior to better understand, protect and serve you and our community. IFTTT may use this data in aggregate form, that is, as a statistical measure, but not in a manner that would identify you personally. As part of this use of information, we may provide aggregate information, not information about you personally, to our partners about how our users, collectively, use our Service.\n  \n  We use analytics to help analyze how our users use the Services. Google Analytics uses cookies to collect information such as how often our users visit the Services, what pages they visit, and what other sites they used prior to coming to the Services. We may use the information we get from Google Analytics to improve our Services or to send you promotional messages about our Services. Google Analytics collects the IP address assigned to you on the date you visit the Services, but not your name or other personally identifying information. We do not combine the information generated through the use of Google Analytics with any personally identifying information. Although Google Analytics plants a persistent Cookie to identify you as a unique user the next time you visit the Service, the Cookie cannot be used by anyone but Google. Google\u2019s ability to use and share information collected by Google Analytics about your visits to the Service is restricted by the Google Analytics Terms of Use and the Google Privacy Policy. You may find additional information about Google Analytics at http://www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners.\n  \nInformation Collected From Other Websites and Do Not Track Policy\n  Through cookies we place on your browser or device, we may collect information about your online activity after you leave our Service.  Just like any other usage information we collect, this information allows us to improve the Service and customize your online experience, and otherwise as described in this Privacy Policy.  Your browser may offer you a \u201cDo Not Track\u201d option, which allows you to signal to operators of websites and web applications and services (including behavioral advertising services) that you do not wish such operators to track certain of your online activities over time and across different websites.  Our Service does not support Do Not Track requests at this time, which means that we collect information about your online activity both while you are using the Service and after you leave our Service.\n  \nInformation You Provide to Us\n  We receive and store any information you enter on the Service or provide to us in any other way. You can choose not to provide us with certain information, though you may not be able to take advantage of many Service features. The personal information you provide may be used for such purposes as responding to your questions or requests, customizing the content you see, and communicating with you about new Service features. If you send us personal correspondence, such as emails or letters, or if other users or third parties send us correspondence about your activities or postings on the Service, we may collect such information into a file specific to you. You agree that we may use your personal information to contact you as provided herein, though our intent is that email is the only channel we will use to contact you without your consent.\n  \n  Also, once you install any Mobile Apps and enable specific Platform Services, you may be providing us with additional information, such as contacts and camera-photos on your device. Additionally, we may collect information about your location and calendar in order to provide you with more personalized Service. Again, you can choose not to provide us with certain information, though you may not be able to take advantage of many Service features.\n  \n  If you provide your third-party account credentials to us or otherwise sign in to the Services through a third party site or Platform Service, you understand some content and/or information in those accounts (\u201cThird Party Account Information\u201d) may be transmitted into your account with us if you authorize such transmissions, and that Third Party Account Information transmitted to our Services is covered by this Privacy Policy.\n  \n  One such service may include the ability for you to automatically transmit Third Party Account Information to your Services profile or to automatically transmit information in your Services profile to your third party account.\n  \n  In order for you to take full advantage of the Service, you must provide registration information, including an e-mail address and password. We may also request demographic information and unique identifiers in order to provide you with a more personalized service, but this information is optional. Once you register for the Service, create Applets, and/or give us your personal information, you are not anonymous to us. Usernames and links to public accounts are only shown on your profile with your consent. You always have the option to not provide information by choosing not to register for the Service or create any Applets. Our primary purpose in collecting personal information is to provide you with a safe, smooth, and efficient experience. We only collect personal information about you that we consider necessary for achieving this purpose. IFTTT does not sell or rent your personal information to third parties without your explicit consent. IFTTT may disclose information it has collected from you and/or that you have made available through the Service when it believes in good faith that the law or legal process requires it, or when it is necessary to do so to protect the rights or property of IFTTT or others. You are responsible for managing the flow of your private information from one third party Platform Service to another. If you post personal information online that is accessible to the public, that information becomes publicly available and can be collected and used by others and redistributed through the internet and other media channels. For example, if you push a private post on Facebook to a public blog, the private post will no longer be private. You may receive unsolicited messages from other parties in return.\n  \nIs My Information Secure?\nWe treat data as an asset that must be protected against loss and unauthorized access. We use industry-standard Secure Socket Layer (SSL) software to protect the security of your personal information during transmission, which encrypts all of the information you input. All personal information collected from other Platform Services that you provide through the use of the Service is stored securely. Only employees who need personal information to perform a specific job (for example, a customer service representative) are granted access to it. All of our employees are kept up to date on our privacy and security practices.\n  \n  Due to the existing regulatory environment, we cannot ensure that all of your private communications and other personal information will never be disclosed in ways not otherwise described in this Privacy Policy. By way of example, we may be forced to disclose personal information to the government or third parties under certain circumstances or third parties may unlawfully intercept or access transmissions or private communications.\n  \n  You need to work to protect against unauthorized access to your passwords and to your computer by signing off once you have finished using a shared computer. You are responsible for all actions taken with your User ID and password. Therefore we recommend that you do not disclose your password to any third parties. If you choose to share your User ID and password or your personal information with third parties, you are responsible for all actions taken with your account and therefore you should review that third party's privacy policy. If you lose control of your password, you may lose substantial control over your personal information and may be subject to legally binding actions taken on your behalf such as if someone used your User and ID password to forward libelous material through the Service. Therefore, if your password has been compromised for any reason, you should immediately change your password.\n  \nWhat about Cookies?\n  When you visit the Site, we may send one or more \"cookies\" to your computer hard drive through your Web browser. A cookie is a small file containing a string of information that a website stores on a visitor's computer, and that the visitor's browser provides to the website each time the visitor returns. Any use of cookies by us will be solely for the purposes of improving the quality of access to the Site by storing user preferences, and tracking user trends, such as how people use the Site, and their Site access preferences. Cookies tell us how and when pages in our Site are visited and by how many people. We use cookies to allow you to enter your login information less frequently. To the extent IFTTT uses cookies, such cookies do not collect personal information, and we do not combine information collected through cookies with other personal information to tell us who you are or what your username or e-mail address is. You are always free to decline our cookies if your browser permits, although in that case you may not be able to use certain features on the Site and you may be required to reenter your password or login information more frequently. IFTTT visitors who do not wish to have cookies placed on their computers should set their browsers to refuse cookies before using the Site. Most browsers are initially set up to accept cookies, but you can reset your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. We recommend that you leave the cookies activated, however, because deleting cookies may reduce the functionality of IFTTT. We do not control the use of cookies by third parties.\n  \nWill IFTTT Share Any of the Information it Receives with Other Entities?\n  We may use third party service providers to facilitate or outsource one or more aspects of our business and therefore we may provide some of your personal information directly to these service providers. These service providers are subject to confidentiality agreements with us and other legal restrictions that prohibit their use of the information we provide them for any other purpose except to facilitate the specific outsourced IFTTT related operation, unless you have given your prior permission to them for additional uses. We may share our data, including personal information about you with our partners and joint ventures in furtherance of our business. To the extent that these entities have access to your information, they will treat it at least as protectively as they treat information they obtain from their other users. Our partners and joint ventures follow privacy practices no less protective of all users than our practices described in this document, to the extent allowed by applicable law. In some cases, we may choose to buy or sell assets. In these types of transactions, customer information is typically one of the business assets that is transferred.\n  \n  Moreover, if IFTTT, or substantially all of its assets, were acquired, or in the unlikely event that IFTTT goes out of business or enters bankruptcy, customer information would be one of the assets that may be transferred to or acquired by a third party. You acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and that any acquirer of IFTTT may continue to use your personal information as set forth in this policy. IFTTT cooperates with law enforcement inquiries, as well as other third parties to enforce laws and intellectual property rights. Therefore, in response to a verified request by law enforcement or other government officials relating to a criminal investigation or alleged illegal activity, we can (and you authorize us to) disclose your name, city, state, telephone number, and email address. We will not otherwise disclose your personal information to law enforcement or other government officials without a subpoena, court order or substantially similar legal procedure, except when we believe in good faith that the disclosure of information is necessary to prevent imminent physical harm or financial loss; or report suspected illegal activity. This Privacy Policy applies to the IFTTT Service only. We do not exercise control over any sites that you may visit from a link on our Site. These other sites may place their own cookies or other files on your computer, collect data or solicit personal information from you. Since IFTTT does not control the privacy policies of third parties, you are subject to the privacy policies of that third party. We encourage you to ask questions before you disclose your personal information to others.\n  \n  We may de-identify your Personal Information so that you are not identified as an individual, and provide that information to our partners. We may also provide aggregate usage information to our partners (or allow partners to collect that information from you), who may use such information to understand how often and in what ways people use our Services, so that they, too, can provide you with an optimal online experience. However, we never disclose aggregate usage or de-identified information to a partner (or allow a partner to collect such information) in a manner that would identify you as an individual person.\n  \n  Except as set forth above, you will be notified when your personal information may be shared with third parties, and you will be able to prevent the sharing of this information.\n  \nAccessing, Reviewing and Changing Your Personal Information\n  Services can be disconnected at anytime though prior Applets may remain in our electronic archive. You can change your email address and contact information by going to the settings page. You must promptly update your personal information if it changes or is inaccurate. You may be able to add or update certain additional information via the Service. When you update information, however, we often maintain a copy of the unrevised information in our records. Please note that information may remain in our records after deletion of your account. IFTTT will only update your information on third party sites or send you information (phone, sms, etc.) with your specific consent, such as when you add Applets to your account.\n  \nUser Communications\n  You may input your contact information into the Service so that IFTTT may contact you. When you enter your contact information or send an email or other communication to IFTTT, we may retain those communications in order to process your inquiries and respond to your requests. We do not use your email address or contact information to send commercial or marketing messages nor do we give or sell this information to any third parties. To the extent your e-mail address is provided to IFTTT, you may receive e-mail or other communications from us.\n  \nYour California Privacy Rights\n  Under California Civil Code Sections 1798.83-1798.84, California residents are entitled to ask us for a notice identifying the categories of personal information which we share with our affiliates and/or third parties for marketing purposes, and providing contact information for such affiliates and/or third parties. If you are a California resident and would like a copy of this notice, please submit a written request to: privacy@ifttt.com or IFTTT Inc., 923 Market Street STE 400, San Francisco, California, 94103, Attn: Legal\n  \nChanges to this Policy\n  Please note that this Privacy Policy may change from time to time. We will not reduce your rights under this Policy without your explicit consent, and we expect most such changes will be minor. Regardless, we will post any Policy changes on this page. We may amend this Privacy Policy at any time by posting the amend terms on the Site. All amended terms shall automatically be effective thirty (30) days after they are initially posted on the Site. Each version of this Policy will be identified at the top of the page by its effective date.\n  \nContact Us\n  If you have any additional questions or concerns about this policy or the Service in general, please feel free to contact us at privacy@ifttt.com.\n  \n  If you are a resident of the European Union (\u201cEU\u201d), United Kingdom, Lichtenstein, Norway, or Iceland, you may have additional rights under the EU General Data Protection Regulation (the \u201cGDPR\u201d) with respect to your Personal Data, as outlined below.\n  \n  For this section, we use the terms \u201cPersonal Data\u201d and \u201cprocessing\u201d as they are defined in the GDPR, but \u201cPersonal Data\u201d generally means information that can be used to individually identify a person, and \u201cprocessing\u201d generally covers actions that can be performed in connection with data such as collection, use, storage and disclosure.  IFTTT will be the controller of your Personal Data processed in connection with the Service.\n  \n  If there are any conflicts between this section and any other provision of this Privacy Policy, the policy or portion that is more protective of Personal Data shall control to the extent of such conflict.  If you have any questions about this section or whether any of the following applies to you, please contact us at IFTTT@gdpr-rep.com.\n  \nWhat Personal Data Do We Collect From You?\n  We collect Personal Data about you when you provide such information directly to us, when third parties such as our business partners or service providers provide us with Personal Data about you, or when Personal Data about you is automatically collected in connection with your use of our Service.\n  \n  Information we receive directly from you: We receive Personal Data directly from you when you provide us with such Personal Data, including without limitation the following:\n    \n---First and last name\n---Email address\n---Mailing address\n---Telephone number\n---Transaction Information (IFTTT does not store your credit or debit card information)\n---User content, for example, action ingredients that are displayed when an Applet runs\n  Information we receive from third party sources includes Applet trigger fields, ingredients, and action fields.  This data is unique to your use of IFTTT and can be found on the Applet configuration panel for any of your Applets: https://ifttt.com/my_applets.\n  \n  Some third parties, such as our business partners and service providers, provide us with Personal Data about you, such as the following:\n    \n---\n      Account information for third party Platform Services: If you interact with a third party Platform Service when using our Service, such as if you use a third party service to log-in to our Service (e.g., Facebook Login or Google Sign-In), or if you share content from our Service through a third party social media Platform Service, the third party service will send us information about you, such as information from your public profile, if the third party service and your account settings allow such sharing. The information we receive will depend on the policies and your account settings with the third party service.\n      \n---\n      Information from our advertising partners: We receive information about you from some of our service providers who assist us with marketing or promotional services related to how you interact with our websites, applications, products, services, advertisements or communications.\n      \n---\n        Information we automatically collect when you use our Service:  Some Personal Data is automatically collected when you use our Service, such as the following:\n        \nIP address\nDevice identifiers\nWeb browser information\nPage view statistics\nBrowsing history\nUsage information\nTransaction information (e.g. transaction amount, date and time such transaction occurred)\nCookies and other tracking technologies (e.g. web beacons, pixel tags, SDKs, etc.)\nLocation information (e.g. IP address, zip code)\nLog data (e.g. access times, hardware and software information)\nHow Do We Use Your Personal Data?\n  We process Personal Data to operate, improve, understand and personalize our Service.  For example, we use Personal Data to:\n    \n---Create and manage user profiles\n---Communicate with you about the Service\n---Process orders\n---Contact you about Service announcements, updates or offers\n---Provide support and assistance for the Service\n---Personalize website content and communications based on your preferences\n---Meet contract or legal obligations\n---Respond to user inquiries\n---Fulfill user requests\n---Comply with our legal or contractual obligations\n---Resolve disputes\n---Protect against or deter fraudulent, illegal or harmful actions\n---Enforce our Terms of Service\n  We will only process your Personal Data if we have a lawful basis for doing so. Lawful bases for processing include consent, contractual necessity and our \u201clegitimate interests\u201d or the legitimate interest of others, as further described below.\n    \n---\n      Contractual Necessity:  We process the following categories of Personal Data as a matter of \u201ccontractual necessity\u201d, meaning that we need to process the data to perform under our Terms of Use with you, which enables us to provide you with the Service.  When we process data due to contractual necessity, failure to provide such Personal Data will result in your inability to use some or all portions of the Service that require such data.\n      \n---\n      Legitimate Interest:  We process the following categories of Personal Data when we believe it furthers the legitimate interest of us or third parties.\n      Examples of these legitimate interests include:\n        \nOperation and improvement of our business, products and services\nMarketing of our products and services\nProvision of customer support\nProtection from fraud or security threats\nCompliance with legal obligations\nCompletion of corporate transactions\n---\n      Consent: In some cases, we process Personal Data based on the consent you expressly grant to us at the time we collect such data.  When we process Personal Data based on your consent, it will be expressly indicated to you at the point and time of collection.\n      \n---\n      Other Processing Grounds:  From time to time we may also need to process Personal Data to comply with a legal obligation, if it is necessary to protect the vital interests of you or other data subjects, or if it is necessary for a task carried out in the public interest.\n      \nHow and With Whom Do We Share Your Data?\n  We share Personal Data with vendors, third party service providers and agents who work on our behalf and provide us with services related to the purposes described in this Privacy Policy or our Terms of Service. These parties include:\n    \n---Payment processors\n---Fraud prevention service providers\n---Ad networks\n---Analytics service providers\n---Staff augmentation and contract personnel\n---Hosting service providers\n---Co-location service providers\n---Telecommunications service providers\n  We also share Personal Data when necessary to complete a transaction initiated or authorized by you or provide you with a product or service you have requested.

Furthermore, if we choose to buy or sell assets, user information is typically one of the transferred business assets. Moreover, if we, or substantially all of our assets, were acquired, or if we go out of business or enter bankruptcy, user information would be one of the assets that is transferred or acquired by a third party, and we would share Personal Data with the party that is acquiring our assets. You acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and that any acquirer of us or our assets may continue to use your Personal Information as set forth in this policy.\n  \nHow Long Do We Retain Your Personal Data?\n  We retain Personal Data about you for as long as you have an open account with us or as otherwise necessary to provide you Service.  In some cases we retain Personal Data for longer, if doing so is necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes or collect fees owed, or is otherwise permitted or required by applicable law, rule or regulation. Afterwards, we retain some information in a depersonalized or aggregated form but not in a way that would identify you personally.\n  \nWhat Security Measures Do We Use?\n  We seek to protect Personal Data using appropriate technical and organizational measures based on the type of Personal Data and applicable processing activity.\n  \n  Personal Data of Children: We do not knowingly collect or solicit Personal Data from anyone under the age of 16.   If you are under 16, please do not attempt to register for the Service or send any Personal Data about yourself to us.  If we learn that we have collected Personal Data from a child under age 16, we will delete that information as quickly as possible. If you believe that a child under 16 may have provided us Personal Data, please contact us at IFTTT@gdpr-rep.com.\n  \nWhat Rights Do You Have Regarding Your Personal Data?\n  You have certain rights with respect to your Personal Data, including those set forth below.  For more information about these rights, or to submit a request, please email IFTTT@gdpr-rep.com. Please note that in some circumstances, we may not be able to fully comply with your request, such as if it is frivolous or extremely impractical, if it jeopardizes the rights of others, or if it is not required by law, but in those circumstances, we will still respond to notify you of such a decision. In some cases, we may also need to you to provide us with additional information, which may include Personal Data, if necessary to verify your identity and the nature of your request.\n    \n---\n      Access: You can request more information about the Personal Data we hold about you and request a copy of such Personal Data. You can also access certain of your Personal Data by choosing to export your data.\n      \n---\n      Rectification: If you believe that any Personal Data we are holding about you is incorrect or incomplete, you can request that we correct or supplement such data.

If you use the Service in any way after a change to the Terms is effective, that means you agree to all of the changes.  Except for changes by us as described here, no other amendment or modification of these Terms will be effective unless in writing and signed by both you and us.\n  \n    The individual who accepts these terms and conditions, must be of a legal age to form a binding contract (or if not, you\u2019ve received your parent\u2019s or guardian\u2019s permission to use the Service and gotten your parent or guardian to agree to these Terms on your behalf).\n  \n    If you\u2019re agreeing to these Terms on behalf of an organization or entity, you represent and warrant that you are authorized to agree to these Terms on that organization or entity\u2019s behalf and bind them to these Terms (in which case, the references to \u201cyou\u201d and \u201cyour\u201d in these Terms, except for in this sentence, refer to that organization or entity).

If you do not want to receive such offers, please use our User Administration pages to adjust your preferences. \n---Business Transfers: As we continue to develop our business, we might sell or buy additional services or business units. In such transactions, user information generally is transferred along with the rest of the service or business unit. Also, in the event that IMDb.com, Inc., or substantially all of its assets are acquired, user information will of course be included in the transaction. \n---Protection of IMDb and Others: We release account and other personal information when we believe release is appropriate to comply with law; enforce or apply our Terms and Conditions of Use and other agreements; or protect the rights, property, or safety of IMDb, our users, or others. This includes exchanging information with other companies and organizations for fraud protection and credit risk reduction. Obviously, however, this does not include selling, renting, sharing, or otherwise disclosing personally identifiable information from customers for commercial purposes in violation of the commitments set forth in this Privacy Notice.\n---With Your Consent: Other than as set out above, you will always receive notice when information about you might go to third parties, and you will have an opportunity to choose not to share the information.\nWhat About Third-Party Advertisers?\nOur site includes third-party advertising and links to other websites. We do not provide any personally identifiable customer information to these advertisers or third-party websites. \nThese third-party websites and advertisers, or Internet advertising companies working on their behalf, sometimes use technology to send (or \"serve\") the advertisements that appear on our website directly to your browser. They automatically receive your IP address when this happens. They may also use cookies, JavaScript, web beacons (also known as action tags or single-pixel gifs), and other technologies to measure the effectiveness of their ads and to personalize advertising content. We do not have access to or control over cookies or other features that they may use, and the information practices of these advertisers and third-party websites are not covered by this Privacy Notice. Please contact them directly for more information about their privacy practices. In addition, the Network Advertising Initiative offers useful information about Internet advertising companies (also called \"ad networks\" or \"network advertisers\"), including information about how to opt-out of their information collection. \nIMDb also displays personalized third-party advertising based on personal information about users, such as information you submit to us about movies you own or have watched.\u00a0 Click here for more information about the personal information that we gather. Although IMDb does not provide any personal information to advertisers, advertisers (including ad-serving companies) may assume that users who interact with or click on a personalized advertisement meet their criteria to personalize the ad (for example, users in the northwestern United States who bought, watched, or browsed for romantic comedies). If you do not want us to use personal information that we gather to allow third parties to personalize advertisements we display to you, please adjust your Advertising Preferences.\nHow Secure Is Information About Me?\nIf you use our subscription service, we work to protect the security of your subscription information during transmission by using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) software, which encrypts information you input. \nIt is important for you to protect against unauthorized access to your password and to your computer. Be sure to sign off when finished using a shared computer.\nWhat Choices and Access Do I Have?\n---As discussed above, you can always choose not to provide information, even though it might be needed to take advantage of such IMDb features as My Movies and local show times. \n---You can add or update certain information, such as your e-mail address, by using our User Administration pages. When you update information, we usually keep a copy of the prior version for our records. \n---If you do not want to receive e-mail or other mail from us, please use our User Administration pages to adjust your preferences. (If you do not want to receive legal notices from us, such as this Privacy Notice, those notices will still govern your use of IMDb, and it is your responsibility to review them for changes.) \n---If you do not want us to use personal information that we gather to allow third parties to personalize advertisements we display to you, please adjust your Advertising Preferences.\n---The \"help\" portion of the toolbar on most browsers will tell you how to prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie, or how to disable cookies altogether. Additionally, you can disable or delete similar data used by browser add-ons, such as Flash cookies, by changing the add-on's settings or visiting the Web site of its manufacturer. However, because cookies allow you to take advantage of some of IMDb's essential features, we recommend that you leave them turned on. \nChildren\nIMDb is not intended for use by children under the age of 13. If you are under 13, you may not submit information about yourself to IMDb. \nConditions of Use, Notices, and Revisions\nIf you choose to visit IMDb, your visit and any dispute over privacy is subject to this Notice and our Terms and Conditions of Use, including limitations on damages, resolution of disputes, and application of the law of the state of Washington.\nIf you have any concern about privacy at IMDb, please send us a thorough description to our customer service team, and we will try to resolve it.\nOur business changes constantly. This Notice and the Terms and Conditions of Use will change also, and use of information that we gather now is subject to the Privacy Notice in effect at the time of use. We may e-mail periodic reminders of our notices and conditions, unless you have instructed us not to, but you should check our Web site frequently to see recent changes. Unless stated otherwise, our current Privacy Notice applies to all information that we have about you and your account.\u00a0 We stand behind the promises we make, however, and will never materially change our policies and practices to make them less protective of customer information collected in the past without the consent of affected customers.\nExamples of Information Collected\nInformation You Give Us:\nYou provide most such information when you register, search, post, participate in a contest or questionnaire, or communicate with us. For example, you provide information when you search for a movie, actor or director; provide information in our registration form; communicate with us by phone, e-mail, or otherwise; complete a questionnaire or a contest entry form; vote in a poll; provide movie reviews or information related to movies; participate in a discussion board; and employ our notification services. As a result of those actions, you might supply us with such information as your name, e-mail address, physical address, zip code, and phone number; your age and gender; the movies and actors you like or dislike; and your general movie preferences.\nAutomatic Information:\nExamples of the information we collect and analyze include the Internet protocol (IP) address used to connect your computer to the Internet; login; password; computer and connection information such as browser type and version, operating system, and platform; purchase history; the full Uniform Resource Locators (URL) clickstream to, through, and from our Web site, including date and time; cookie number; and pages you viewed or searched for. We may also use browser data such as cookies, Flash cookies (also known as Flash Local Shared Objects), or similar data on certain parts of our Web site for fraud prevention and other purposes. During some visits we may use software tools such as JavaScript to measure and collect session information, including page response times, download errors, length of visits to certain pages, page interaction information (such as scrolling, clicks, and mouse-overs), and methods used to browse away from the page.\nInformation from Other Sources:\nExamples of information we receive from other sources include updated delivery and address information so that we can correct our records and deliver your next communication more easily.\nClear your history\n\u00a0\n \n", "http://www.imdb.com/help/show_article?conditions": "\nConditions of Use - IMDb\n \nWelcome to IMDb.

IMDB MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, AS TO THE OPERATION OF THE IMDB SERVICES OR THE INFORMATION, CONTENT, MATERIALS, PRODUCTS (INCLUDING SOFTWARE) OR OTHER SERVICES INCLUDED ON OR OTHERWISE MADE AVAILABLE TO YOU THROUGH THE  IMDB SERVICES. YOU EXPRESSLY AGREE THAT YOUR USE OF THE IMDB SERVICES IS AT YOUR SOLE RISK. IMDB RESERVES THE RIGHT TO WITHDRAW ANY IMDB SERVICE OR DELETE ANY INFORMATION FROM THE IMDB SERVICES AT ANY TIME IN ITS DISCRETION.\nTO THE FULL EXTENT PERMISSIBLE BY APPLICABLE LAW, IMDB DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. IMDB DOES NOT WARRANT THAT  THE IMDB SERVICES, INFORMATION, CONTENT, MATERIALS, PRODUCTS (INCLUDING SOFTWARE) OR OTHER SERVICES INCLUDED ON OR OTHERWISE MADE AVAILABLE TO YOU THROUGH THE IMDB SERVICES, ITS SERVERS, OR  ELECTRONIC COMMUNICATIONS SENT FROM IMDB ARE FREE OF VIRUSES OR OTHER HARMFUL COMPONENTS. IMDB WILL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY DAMAGES OF ANY KIND ARISING FROM THE USE OF  ANY IMDB SERVICE, OR FROM ANY INFORMATION, CONTENT, MATERIALS, PRODUCTS (INCLUDING SOFTWARE) OR OTHER SERVICES INCLUDED ON OR OTHERWISE MADE AVAILABLE TO YOU THROUGH ANY IMDB SERVICE, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, PUNITIVE, AND CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES.\nCERTAIN STATE LAWS DO NOT ALLOW LIMITATIONS ON IMPLIED WARRANTIES OR THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF CERTAIN DAMAGES. IF THESE LAWS APPLY TO YOU, SOME OR ALL OF THE ABOVE DISCLAIMERS, EXCLUSIONS, OR LIMITATIONS MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU, AND YOU MIGHT HAVE ADDITIONAL RIGHTS.\nIMDb Software Terms\nIn addition to these Conditions of Use, the terms found here apply to any software (including any updates or upgrades to the software and any related documentation) that we make available to you from time to time for your use in connection with IMDb Services (\u201cIMDb Software\u201d).  If we provide specific Terms for the IMDb Software and there is a conflict between the specific Terms for the IMDb Software and these Conditions of Use, the specific Terms for the IMDb Software will govern.\nBy using any IMDb Service, you agree that the laws of the state of Washington, without regard to principles of conflict of laws, will govern these Conditions of Use and any dispute of any sort that might arise between you and IMDb.  \nAny dispute or claim relating in any way to your use of  any IMDb Service, or any products or services sold or distributed by IMDb or through the IMDb Services will be resolved by binding arbitration, rather than in court, except that you may assert claims in small claims court if your claims qualify. The Federal Arbitration Act and federal arbitration law apply to this agreement.\na.        There is no judge or jury in arbitration, and court review of an arbitration award is limited. However, an arbitrator can award on an individual basis the same damages and relief as a court (including injunctive and declaratory relief or statutory damages), and must follow the terms of these Conditions of Use as a court would.\nb.      To begin an arbitration proceeding, you must send a letter requesting arbitration and describing your claim to our registered agent Corporation Service Company, 300 Deschutes Way SW, Suite 304, Tumwater, WA 98051. The arbitration will be conducted by the American Arbitration Association (AAA) under its rules, including the AAA\u2019s Supplementary Procedures for Consumer-Related Disputes. The AAA\u2019s rules are available at www.adr.org or by calling 1-800-778-7879. Payment of all filing, administration and arbitrator fees will be governed by the AAA\u2019s rules. We will reimburse those fees for claims totaling less than $10,000 unless the arbitrator determines the claims are frivolous. Likewise, IMDb will not seek attorneys\u2019 fees and costs in arbitration unless the arbitrator determines the claims are frivolous. You may choose to have the arbitration conducted by telephone, based on written submissions, or in person in the county where you live or at another mutually agreed location.  \nc.         You and IMDb each agree that any dispute resolution proceedings will be conducted only on an individual basis and not in a class, consolidated or representative action. If for any reason a claim proceeds in court rather than in arbitration you and IMDb each waive any right to a jury trial. You and IMDb also both agree that you or we may bring suit in court to enjoin infringement or other misuse of intellectual property rights.\nPlease review our other policies. These policies also govern your  use of IMDb Services. We reserve the right to make changes to our site, policies, and these our site, policies, Terms, and these Conditions of Use at any time. If any of these conditions shall be deemed invalid, void, or for any reason unenforceable, that condition shall be deemed severable and shall not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining condition.  \nIMDb.com, Inc.\nP.O. Box 81226\nSeattle, WA 98108-1226\nhttp://www.imdb.com/\nAdditional IMDb Software Terms\n--- Use of the IMDb Software.  You may use the IMDb Software only in connection with the IMDb Services. You may not separate any individual component of the IMDb Software for use other than in connection with the IMDb Services, incorporate any portion of it into your own programs or compile any portion of it in combination with your own programs, transfer it for use with another service, use it, or any portion of it, over a network, or sell, rent, lease, lend, loan, distribute or sub-license the IMDb Software or otherwise assign any rights to the IMDb Software in whole or in part. You may not use the IMDb Software for any illegal purpose.  We may discontinue some or all of any IMDb Software we provide, and we may terminate your right to use any IMDb Software at any time and in such event may modify it to make it inoperable.  Your rights to use the IMDb Software will automatically terminate without notice from us if you fail to comply with any of these terms.  Additional third party terms contained within or distributed with certain IMDb Software that are specifically identified in related documentation may apply to that IMDb Software and will govern the use of that IMDb Software in the event of a conflict with these Conditions of Use.    \n--- Use of Third Party Services. When you use the IMDb Software, you may also be using the services of one or more third parties, such as a wireless carrier or a mobile platform provider. Your use of these third party services may be subject to the separate policies, terms of use, and fees of these third parties.\n--- No Reverse Engineering.  You may not, and you will not encourage, assist or authorize any other person to modify, reverse engineer, decompile or disassemble, or otherwise tamper with, the IMDb Software, whether in whole or in part, or create any derivative works from or of the IMDb Software.\n--- Updates. In order to keep the IMDb Software up-to-date, we may offer automatic or manual updates at any time and without notice to you. \n---Export Regulations; Government End Users. You must comply with all export and re-export restrictions and regulations of the Department of Commerce and other United States agencies and authorities that may apply to the IMDb Software. If you are a U.S. Government end user, we are licensing the IMDb Software to you as a \"Commercial Item\" as that term is defined in the U.S. Code of Federal Regulations (see 48 C.F.R. \u00a7 2.101), and the rights we grant you to the IMDb Software are the same as the rights we grant to all others under these Conditions of Use.\nClear your history\n\u00a0\n \n"}, "imgur.com": {"http://imgur.com/privacy": "\n    Privacy Policy - Imgur\n---we're hiring!\n---blog\n---about imgur\n---imgur store\n---imgur apps\n---developer api\n---advertise\n---need help?\n---Upload Images\n---Video to GIF\n---Make a Meme\n \n \n \n            Your Privacy Rights \u2013 Effective January 28, 2019\n        \n            This privacy policy applies to all Imgur users worldwide. For users in the European Economic Area (EEA) and in Switzerland, Imgur complies with the principles of the U.S.-EU Privacy Shield Program and the U.S.-Swiss Privacy Shield Program, and participates in both programs. Under both programs, we are subject to the investigatory and enforcement powers of the Federal Trade Commission, and we are liable for the unauthorized transfer to third parties of user personal data. For more information, see https://www.privacyshield.gov.\n        \n            Our servers automatically collect the following information regarding devices that access our site or app: device characteristics (including device ID for mobile devices), operating system, browser type, IP address, username from stored cookies if present, dates and times of each login, page and image viewing statistics, and incoming and outgoing links. We also log the metadata associated with any uploaded images. We use this automatically collected anonymous data to analyze how our site and app are used so as to keep them optimized, to determine the popularity and usefulness of various features, to maintain the integrity of user accounts so that each user can see his or her posts and the upvotes, downvotes, and comments to them, and to enable users with usernames to access their posts, albums, and membership information. We also use such data to enable us to comply with copyright law, with 18 USC \u00a72258A (illegal content), and to respond to lawful requests by public authorities, including national security, courts, and law enforcement.\n        \n            None of this information is \u201cpersonal data\u201d \u2013 that is, data we could use to identify a specific person. Some of this information could, however, become personal data because we provide automatically collected anonymous data to third party advertisers to supplement the tracking information described below, and those third parties might be able to combine our anonymous data with other data they have to enable them to identify people.\n        \n            In addition to the automatically collected anonymous data described above, we may place information on your device and then retrieve it later: we may use cookies, web beacons, or other anonymous tracking information to improve our server's interaction with your device. We also partner with third party advertisers who may (themselves or through their partners) place and/or recognize cookies on your device that collect data about which pages and ads are viewed while our app or site is being used. Advertiser cookies enable customized ads that are selected for display on your device based on the anonymous information collected. No personal data is on, connected to, or derivable from, these cookies. If you block or disable cookies and other tracking technologies, instead of getting customized ads you will see non-customized (generic) ads. Although our servers currently don't respond to \"do-not-track\" requests, you can block tracking in other ways. If you would like more information about this practice and to know your choices about not having this information used by these companies for interest based advertising, please visit http://www.aboutads.info/choices/ or see the section below, \u201cAccessing, correcting, and limiting use of your data\u201d.\n        \n            Imgur participates in the Digital Advertising Alliance's (DAA) Self-Regulatory Program for Online Behavioral Advertising. For more information please visit http://www.aboutads.info.\n        \n            If you sign up with a username, we handle it in the same way as an automatically collected username except that if you don\u2019t allow cookies, you have to enter your username each time you log in. A username is, by nature, publicly posted information. On occasion we may run a contest or other type of promotion, and to enable us to award prizes to the winners as well as to comply with the applicable laws, we collect real names and contact information \u2013 so if you win a contest, we\u2019ll ask for that information and we\u2019ll use it only for those two specific purposes.\n        \n            We collect whatever personal data about you that you choose to give us, such as a contact email address (which we do not make public) and profile information. We do not require you to use an account to upload images, and if you open an account you do not have to provide any personal information. If you are located in the EEA and wish to open an account, do not use your real name \u2013 choose a username and email address that reveal nothing about your identity. If you give us an email address, we\u2019ll probably send you promotional messages once in a while; we\u2019ll try to make them fun and interesting but of course you\u2019ll be able to opt out at any time.\n        \n            Imgur does not \u201ccollect\u201d the stuff you post: images, comments, messages, etc., and \u2013 with respect to persons in the EEA \u2013 does not \u201cprocess\u201d or determine any purposes for processing of any information that you manifestly make public. In particular, every image uploaded to Imgur is public \u2013 whether uploaded directly without going through a user account, or uploaded via a user account \u2013 and has its own URL. No matter what your privacy settings are, every image can always be accessed and viewed by anyone who types in that exact URL. No image uploaded to Imgur is ever completely hidden from public view. This is mainly to ensure that Imgur, which allows anonymous postings, will not be used as a platform for illegality. So too for messaging: Imgur allows users to send messages to one another both indirectly (via comments to posts) and directly (via chat). Imgur's messaging functionality is not intended to be a secure messaging platform; it's just for fun. To ensure that Imgur's messaging platform is not used as a platform for illegality, all messages are public. No messages are ever completely hidden from public view. We may monitor user messaging.\n        \n            Uploading a New Post creates a \u201cpost\u201d (also called \u201calbum\u201d) that can be shared to the community. The individual images inside the post are referred to as \u201cimages.\u201d\n            Although nothing you post to Imgur is completely hidden from public view or entirely private, with that understanding you can set the privacy level of posts.\n            \n---\n                    Hidden: Posts will be hidden by default. They are not searchable within Imgur, and will not appear in Imgur\u2019s public gallery or public profile, but each one will still be accessible by going to the post\u2019s URL. They cannot receive comments or earn points.\n                \n---\n                    Public: Posts will be publicly viewable and shared with the community. Public posts shared with the community will allow comments, sharing, and voting, and appear in a user\u2019s profile.\n                \n            You can add favorited posts to folders that you create.\n            Individual public posts that you favorite are always visible from the \u201cAll Favorites\u201d page in your user profile and cannot be hidden, even those within folders. Favorited hidden posts will not appear publicly in your favorites. These settings for favorites cannot be changed, but the visibility of folders can be toggled to public or private.\n            \n---\n                    Public: Folders are visible to the public community on your public profile.\n                \n---\n                    Private: Private folders are kept hidden from your public profile.\n                \n            Because we don\u2019t collect information about the identity of our users and don\u2019t receive any information from third parties enabling us to identify our users, we have no means of knowing, or providing you with information about, whatever anonymous data about you we might have on our servers \u2013 unless you have a username. If you have a username, you may log in and access your data, correct whatever information you deem to be incorrect, opt out of information sharing with our advertisers, or delete your account. For legal reasons we may retain backup and/or archival copies of information prior to your corrections, amendments, or deletions.\n        \n            We take every reasonable precaution to protect the data on our servers from loss, misuse, unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction, taking into account the risk level and the nature of the data. You are responsible for taking every reasonable precaution on your end to protect any unauthorized person from accessing your Imgur account.\n        \n            These terms are governed by California law, excluding its conflicts of law principles, and if there is a lawsuit between a user outside the EEA and Imgur, jurisdiction and venue will lie exclusively in the State where the defendant is located, if within the United States, or in Santa Clara County, California otherwise.   If you are a user located within the EEA and have an unresolved privacy or data use concern that we have not addressed satisfactorily, you have additional recourse mechanisms:  First, you may contact TrustE, our U.S.-based third party dispute resolution provider (free of charge), at https://feedback-form.truste.com/watchdog/request.

If you do not consent, do not use our website.\nYour use of our website to do anything beyond simply accessing/viewing it (that is, uploading, downloading, commenting, etc.), constitutes not merely your consent, but also your electronic signature, meaning that you are contractually bound by these terms and by our Privacy Policy.\nThese Terms of Use are our contract with you. We also have community rules, developed thanks to input from the Imgurian community, that serve as rules for using Imgur publicly.\nIf someone else might own the copyright to it, don't upload it. Don't upload gore, \"hate speech\" (i.e. demeaning race, gender, age, religious or sexual orientation, etc.), or material that is threatening, harassing, defamatory, or that encourages violence or crime. Don't upload illegal content such as child porn or nonconsensual (\"revenge\") porn. Don't hotlink to adult content or to file-sharing, gambling, torrent, warez, or Imgur rip-off sites. Don't impersonate someone else. Also, don't use Imgur to host image libraries you link to from elsewhere, content for your website, advertising, avatars, or anything else that turns us into your content delivery network. If you do \u2013 and we will be the judge \u2013 or if you do anything illegal, in addition to any other legal rights we may have, we will ban you along with the site you're hotlinking from, delete all your images, report you to the authorities if necessary, and prevent you from viewing any images hosted on Imgur.com. We mean it.\nPlease have tons of fun! That's what Imgur is all about.  If something isn't fun -- if you see anything on our site that shouldn't be there because it violates our policies, is illegal (e.g. revenge porn or child porn),  or for some other reason, please let us know by emailing us at abuse@imgur.com.\nYou can upload images anonymously and share them online with only the people you choose to share them with. If you make them publicly available, they may be featured in the gallery. If you share an image publicly with Facebook, Twitter, Digg, Reddit, etc., then it may end up in the gallery.\nVersion 3.3 09/08/2015\nBy uploading a file or other content or by making a comment, you represent and warrant to us that (1) doing so does not violate or infringe anyone else's rights; and (2) you created the file or other content you are uploading, or otherwise have sufficient intellectual property rights to upload the material consistent with these terms. With regard to any file or content you upload to the public portions of our site, you grant Imgur a non-exclusive, royalty-free, perpetual, irrevocable worldwide license (with sublicense and assignment rights) to use, to display online and in any present or future media, to create derivative works of, to allow downloads of, and/or distribute any such file or content. To the extent that you delete any such file or content from the public portions of our site, the license you grant to Imgur pursuant to the preceding sentence will automatically terminate, but will not be revoked with respect to any file or content Imgur has already copied and sublicensed or designated for sublicense. Also, of course, anything you post to a public portion of our site may be used by the public pursuant to the following paragraph even after you delete it.\nBy downloading an image or copying other user-generated content (UGC) from Imgur, you agree that  you do not claim any rights to it. The following conditions apply:\n---You may use UGC for personal, non-commercial purposes.\n---You may use UGC for anything that qualifies as fair use under copyright law, for example journalism (news, comment, criticism, etc.), but please include an attribute (\"Imgur\" or \"courtesy of Imgur\") next to where it is displayed.\n---You may not use UGC for non-journalistic commercial purposes.\n---Your use of UGC is at your own risk.  IMGUR MAKES NO WARRANTIES OF NON-INFRINGEMENT, and you will indemnify and hold Imgur harmless from any copyright infringement claims arising out of your use of the UGC. (See our general disclaimers below.)\nYou may not copy or use any portions of our site that are not UGC except within the limits of fair use.\nIf you see anything on our site that you believe infringes your copyright rights, you may notify our Digital Millennium Copyright Act (\"DMCA\") agent by sending the following information:\n---Identification of the copyrighted work or works claimed to have been infringed. IMPORTANT: you must have a registered copyright for the work, or at least have filed with the Copyright Office (http://www.copyright.gov/eco/) an application to register a copyright for the work. DMCA notifications based on unregistered works are not valid.\n---Identification of the material on our servers that is claimed to be infringing and that is to be removed, including the URL or other information to enable us to locate the material.\n---A statement that you have a good faith belief that use of the material in the manner complained of is not authorized by you as copyright owner, or by your agent, or by law.\n---A statement that the information in your notice is accurate, and under penalty of perjury, that you are the owner (or authorized to act on behalf of the owner) of the exclusive copyright right that is allegedly being infringed.\n---Your physical or electronic signature, or of someone authorized to act on your behalf.\n---Instructions on how we may contact you: preferably email, but also address and phone.\nBecause a DMCA takedown notice, to be valid, must be based on a work for which the copyright is registered with the Copyright Office (or for which registration has been applied for), and because a high percentage of DMCA takedown notices are not valid. It will speed our investigation of your DMCA notice if you attach to it a copy of your copyright registration, or registration application, for the work.\nOur agent to receive such notifications of claimed infringement is Alan Schaaf.\nEmail:\nabuse@imgur.com\nMailing Address:\nImgur Inc.\n                415 Jackson Street, Ste. 200\n                San Francisco, CA 94111\nUse the same procedure for any claimed trademark violations or other infringements. If we receive a DMCA takedown demand for material you posted that we believe constitutes fair use, we will attempt to notify you if we have your contact info; otherwise we are under no obligation to notify you regarding the removal. We reserve the right to refuse to remove any material that in our view constitutes fair use. If we identify you as a \"repeat infringer,\" we will block or remove your images and terminate any accounts you have with us. (If we notify you of a DMCA removal and you respond with a legitimate counter-notice, that won't count toward being a repeat infringer.) Keep in mind that we reserve the right to remove any content at any time whether or not it infringes or violates any of our policies.\n            Any uses of our name, trademarks, and logos must follow our\n            Trademark Use Policy.\n        \nAlthough of course we strive to make Imgur as dependable as possible, Imgur's services are provided on an AS IS \u2013 WITH ALL FAULTS basis. Your use of our service is entirely at your own risk. We do not guarantee the availability of our service at any given time, or the reliability of our service when it is running. We do not guarantee the integrity of, or the continued availability of, files on our servers. Whether we make backups, and if so, whether restoration of those backups will be available to you, is at our discretion.

NOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING ELSE STATED IN THESE TERMS, AND IRRESPECTIVE OF WHETHER IMGUR TAKES OR DOES NOT TAKE MEASURES TO REMOVE INAPPROPRIATE OR HARMFUL CONTENT FROM ITS SITE, IMGUR HAS NO DUTY TO MONITOR ANY CONTENT ON ITS SITE. IMGUR DOES NOT ASSUME RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE ACCURACY, APPROPRIATENESS, OR HARMLESSNESS OF ANY CONTENT APPEARING ON IMGUR.COM THAT IS NOT PRODUCED BY IMGUR, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO USER CONTENT, ADVERTISING CONTENT, OR OTHERWISE.\nYour sole remedy for the loss of any services and/or of any images or other data you may have stored on Imgur's service is to discontinue your use of our service. IMGUR WILL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF YOUR USE OF, OR INABILITY TO USE, IMGUR'S SERVICES, EVEN IF IMGUR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF OR REASONABLY SHOULD HAVE KNOWN OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. NO CAUSE OF ACTION ARISING OUT OF YOUR USE OF IMGUR'S SERVICES MAY BE BROUGHT MORE THAN ONE YEAR AFTER IT OCCURS.\nYOU WILL INDEMNIFY AND HOLD IMGUR AND ALL OF ITS PERSONNEL HARMLESS FROM ALL LOSS, LIABILITY, CLAIMS, DAMAGES AND EXPENSES, INCLUDING REASONABLE ATTORNEY FEES, ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO YOUR VIOLATION OF THESE TERMS, YOUR INFRINGEMENT OF ANY THIRD PARTY'S RIGHTS, AND ANY HARM CAUSED TO ANY THIRD PARTY AS A RESULT OF YOUR UPLOADING OF FILES, COMMENTS, OR ANYTHING ELSE TO OUR SERVERS.\n\"Imgur\" or \"we\" refers to Imgur, Inc., a Delaware corporation, and its successors and assigns. \"You\" refers to any person who has consented to these terms or has become contractually bound to them, whether such person is identified or not at the time. These terms are governed by California law, excluding its conflicts of law principles, and if there is a lawsuit between you and Imgur, jurisdiction and venue will lie exclusively in the State where the defendant is located, if within the United States, or in Santa Clara County, California otherwise. If any part of these terms is invalid, the remaining provisions will be unaffected. These Terms of Use constitute the entire agreement among the parties relating to this subject matter, and they will continue to govern any issues that arise out of your use of Imgur's services even after you discontinue using them. We may revise these terms from time to time without notice. Whenever we do so, we will so indicate by changing the version date at the top. Any changes apply as of the time they are posted.

It also includes sharing data, when it is required to provide the service or carry out the transactions you request.---Improve and develop our products.---Personalize our products and make recommendations.---Advertise and market to you, which includes sending promotional communications, targeting advertising, and presenting you with relevant offers.We also use the data to operate our business, which includes analyzing our performance, meeting our legal obligations, developing our workforce, and doing research. In carrying out these purposes, we combine data we collect from different contexts (for example, from your use of two Microsoft products) or obtain from third parties to give you a more seamless, consistent, and personalized experience, to make informed business decisions, and for other legitimate purposes.Full textMicrosoft uses the data we collect to provide you rich, interactive experiences. In particular, we use data to:---Provide our products, which includes updating, securing, and troubleshooting, as well as providing support. It also includes sharing data, when it is required to provide the service or carry out the transactions you request.---Improve and develop our products.---Personalize our products and make recommendations.---Advertise and market to you, which includes sending promotional communications, targeting advertising, and presenting you relevant offers.We also use the data to operate our business, which includes analyzing our performance, meeting our legal obligations, developing our workforce, and doing research. For these purposes, we combine data we collect from different contexts (for example, from your use of two Microsoft products). For example, Cortana uses the favorite sports teams you add to the Microsoft Sports app to provide information relevant to your interests, and Microsoft Store uses information about the apps and services you use to make personalized app recommendations. However, we have built in technological and procedural safeguards designed to prevent certain data combinations where required by law. For example, where required by law, we store data we collect from you when you are unauthenticated (not signed in) separately from any account information that directly identifies you, such as your name, email address, or phone number.When we process personal data about you, we do so with your consent and/or as necessary to provide the products you use, operate our business, meet our contractual and legal obligations, protect the security of our systems and our customers, or fulfill other legitimate interests of Microsoft as described in this section and in the\r\nReasons we share personal data\u00a0section of this privacy statement. When we transfer personal data from the European Economic Area, we do so based on a variety of legal mechanisms, as described in the\r\nWhere we store and process personal data\u00a0section of this privacy statement.More on the purposes of processing:---Provide our products. We use data to operate our products and provide you with rich, interactive experiences. For example, if you use OneDrive, we process the documents you upload to OneDrive to enable you to retrieve, delete, edit, forward, or otherwise process it, at your direction as part of the service. Or, for example, if you enter a search query in the Bing search engine, we use that query to display search results to you. Additionally, as communications are a feature of various products, programs, and activities, we use data to contact you. For example, we may contact you by phone or email or other means to inform you when a subscription is ending or discuss your licensing account. We also communicate with you to secure our products, for example by letting you know when product updates are available.---Product improvement. We use data to continually improve our products, including adding new features or capabilities. For example, we use error reports to improve security features, search queries and clicks in Bing to improve the relevancy of the search results, usage data to determine what new features to prioritize, and voice data to improve speech recognition accuracy.---Personalization. Many products include personalized features, such as recommendations that enhance your productivity and enjoyment. These features use automated processes to tailor your product experiences based on the data we have about you, such as inferences we make about you and your use of the product, activities, interests, and location. For example, depending on your settings, if you stream movies in a browser on your Windows device, you may see a recommendation for an app from the Microsoft Store that streams more efficiently. If you have a Microsoft account, with your permission, we can sync your settings on several devices. Many of our products provide controls to disable personalized features.---Product activation. We use data\u2014such as device and application type, location, and unique device, application, network, and subscription identifiers\u2014to activate products that require activation.---Product development. We use data to develop new products. For example, we use data, often de-identified, to better understand our customers\u2019 computing and productivity needs which can shape the development of new products.---Customer support. We use data to troubleshoot and diagnose product problems, repair customers\u2019 devices, and provide other customer care and support services.---Help secure and troubleshoot. We use data to help secure and troubleshoot our products. This includes using data to protect the security and safety of our products and customers, detecting malware and malicious activities, troubleshooting performance and compatibility issues to help customers get the most out of their experiences, and notifying customers of updates to our products. This may include using automated systems to detect security and safety issues.---Safety. We use data to protect the safety of our products and our customers. Our security features and products can disrupt the operation of malicious software and notify users if malicious software is found on their devices. For example, some of our  products, such as Outlook or OneDrive, systematically scan content in an automated manner to identify suspected spam, viruses, abusive actions, or URLs that have been flagged as fraud, phishing, or malware links; and we reserve the right to block delivery of a communication or remove content if it violates our terms.---Updates. We use data we collect to develop product updates and security patches. For example, we may use information about your device\u2019s capabilities, such as available memory, to provide you a software update or security patch. Updates and patches are intended to maximize your experience with our products, help you protect the privacy and security of your data, provide new features, and ensure your device is ready to process such updates.---Promotional communications. We use data we collect to deliver promotional communications. You can sign up for email subscriptions and choose whether you wish to receive promotional communications from Microsoft by email, SMS, physical mail, and telephone. For information about managing your contact data, email subscriptions, and promotional communications, see the How to access and control your personal data\r\n section of this privacy statement.---Relevant offers. Microsoft uses data to provide you with relevant and valuable information regarding our products. We analyze data from a variety of sources to  predict the information that will be most interesting and relevant to you and deliver such information to you in a variety of ways. For example, we may predict your interest in gaming and communicate with you about new games you may like.---Advertising. Microsoft does not use what you say in email, chat, video calls, or voice mail, or your documents, photos, or other personal files to target ads to you.

We also share data with Microsoft-controlled affiliates and subsidiaries; with vendors working on our behalf; when required by law or to respond to legal process; to protect our customers; to protect lives; to maintain the security of our products; and to protect the rights and property of Microsoft and its customers.\r\nFull text\r\n    We share your personal data with your consent or as necessary to complete any transaction or provide any product you have requested or authorized. For example, we share your content with third parties when you tell us to do so, such as when you send an email to a friend, share photos and documents on OneDrive, or link accounts with another service. If you use a Microsoft product provided by an organization you are affiliated with, such as an employer or school, or use an email address provided by such organization to access Microsoft products, we share certain data, such as interaction data and diagnostic data to enable your organization to manage the products. When you provide payment data to make a purchase, we will share payment data with banks and other entities that process payment transactions or provide other financial services, and for fraud prevention and credit risk reduction. \r\n\r\n    In addition, we share personal data among Microsoft-controlled affiliates and subsidiaries. We also share personal data with vendors or agents working on our behalf for the purposes described in this statement. For example, companies we've hired to provide customer service support or assist in protecting and securing our systems and services may need access to personal data to provide those functions. In such cases, these companies must abide by our data privacy and security requirements and are not allowed to use personal data they receive from us for any other purpose. We may also disclose personal data as part of a corporate transaction such as a merger or sale of assets.\r\n\r\n    Finally, we will retain, access, transfer, disclose, and preserve personal data, including your content (such as the content of your emails in Outlook.com, or files in private folders on OneDrive), when we have a good faith belief that doing so is necessary to do any of the following:\r\n---Comply with applicable law or respond to valid legal process, including from law enforcement or other government agencies. ---Protect our customers, for example, to prevent spam or attempts to defraud users of our products, or to help prevent the loss of life or serious injury of anyone.---Operate and maintain the security of our products, including to prevent or stop an attack on our computer systems or networks.---Protect the rights or property of Microsoft, including enforcing the terms governing the use of the services\u2014however, if we receive information indicating that someone is using our services to traffic in stolen intellectual or physical property of Microsoft, we will not inspect a customer's private content ourselves, but we may refer the matter to law enforcement.\r\n    For more information about data we disclose in response to requests from law enforcement and other government agencies, please see our Law Enforcement Requests Report. \r\n    Please note that some of our products include links to products of third parties whose privacy practices differ from those of Microsoft.

In some cases, your ability to access or control your personal data will be limited, as required or permitted by applicable law.\r\n\r\n    If your organization, such as your employer, school, or service provider, provides you with access to and is administering your use of Microsoft products, contact your organization to learn more about how to access and control your personal data.\r\n\r\n    You can access and control your personal data that Microsoft has obtained, and exercise your data protection rights, using various tools we provide. The tools most useful to you will depend on our interactions with you and your use of our products. Here is a general list of tools we provide to help you control your personal data; specific products may provide additional controls.\r\n---Microsoft privacy dashboard. You can control some of the data Microsoft processes through your use of a Microsoft account on the Microsoft privacy dashboard. From here, for example, you can view and clear the browsing, search, and location data associated with your Microsoft account. You can also manage data in your Cortana Notebook and Microsoft Health services. ---Microsoft account. If you wish to access, edit, or remove the profile information and payment information in your Microsoft account, change your password, add security information or close your account, you can do so by visiting the \r\nMicrosoft account website.---Volume Licensing Service Center (VLSC). If you are a Volume Licensing customer, you can control your contact information and subscription and licensing data in one location by visiting the Volume Licensing Service Center website.---Skype. If you wish to access, edit, or remove some profile and payment information in your account for Skype or change your password, sign in to your account.---Xbox.

You can access and update your profile on microsoft.com by visiting your Microsoft account profile page.---If you have a Microsoft Developer Network (MSDN) public profile, you can access and edit your data by signing in at MSDN forum.\r\n    Not all personal data processed by Microsoft can be accessed or controlled via the tools above. If you want to access or control personal data processed by Microsoft that is not available via the tools above or directly through the Microsoft products you use, you can always contact Microsoft at the address in the How to contact us section or by using our web form. We will respond to requests to control your personal data within 30 days.Your communications preferences \r\n    You can choose whether you wish to receive promotional communications from Microsoft by email, SMS, physical mail, and telephone. If you receive promotional email or SMS messages from us and would like to opt out, you can do so by following the directions in that message. You can also make choices about the receipt of promotional email, telephone calls, and postal mail by signing in with your personal Microsoft account, and viewing your communication permissions where you can update contact information, manage Microsoft-wide contact preferences, opt out of email subscriptions, and choose whether to share your contact information with Microsoft partners. If you do not have a personal Microsoft account, you can manage your Microsoft email contact preferences by using this \r\nweb form. These choices do not apply to mandatory service communications that are part of certain Microsoft products, programs, activities, or to surveys or other informational communications that have their own \r\n    unsubscribe method.\r\nYour advertising choices\r\n    To opt out of receiving interest-based advertising from Microsoft, visit our opt-out page. When you opt out, your preference is stored in a cookie that is specific to the web browser you are using. The opt-out cookie has an expiration date of five years. If you delete the cookies on your device, you need to opt out again.\r\n\r\n    You can also link your opt-out choice with your personal Microsoft account. It will then apply on any device where you use that account and will continue to apply until someone signs in with a different personal Microsoft account on that device. If you delete the cookies on your device, you will need to sign in again for the settings to apply.\r\n\r\n    For Microsoft-controlled advertising that appears in apps on Windows, you may use the opt-out linked to your personal Microsoft account, or opt out of interest-based advertising by turning off the advertising ID in Windows settings.\r\n    Because the data used for interest-based advertising is also used for other necessary purposes (including providing our products, analytics, and fraud detection), opting out of interest-based advertising does not stop that data collection. You will continue to get ads, although they may be less relevant to you.\r\n\r\n    You can opt out of receiving interest-based advertising from third parties we partner with by visiting their sites (see above).Browser-based controls \r\n    When you use a browser, you can control your personal data using certain features. For example:---Cookie controls. You can control the data stored by cookies and withdraw consent to cookies by using the browser-based cookie controls described in the Cookies section of this privacy statement. ---Tracking protection. You can control the data third-party sites can collect about you using Tracking Protection in Internet Explorer (versions 9 and up). This feature will block third-party content, including cookies, from any site that is listed in a Tracking Protection List you add. ---Browser controls for \"Do Not Track.\" Some browsers have incorporated \"Do Not Track\" (DNT) features that can send a signal to the websites you visit indicating you do not wish to be tracked. Because there is not yet a common understanding of how to interpret the DNT signal, Microsoft services do not currently respond to browser DNT signals. We continue to work with the online industry to define a common understanding of how to treat DNT signals. In the meantime, you can use the range of other tools we provide to control data collection and use, including the ability to opt out of receiving interest-based advertising from Microsoft as described above.

For example, we use cookies to count the number of unique visitors to a web page or service and to develop other statistics about the operations of our products.---Performance. Microsoft uses cookies to understand and improve how our products perform. For example, we use cookies to gather data that helps with load balancing; this helps ensure that our websites remain up and running. Some of the cookies we commonly use are listed below.

For example:---Companies we hire to provide services on our behalf, such as site analytics, place cookies when you visit our sites. See opt-out links below.---Companies that deliver content, such as videos or news, or ads on Microsoft sites, place cookies on their own. These companies use the data they process in accordance with their privacy policies, which may enable these companies to collect and combine information about your activities across websites, apps, or online services.How to control cookiesMost web browsers automatically accept cookies but provide controls that allow you to block or delete them. For example, in Microsoft Edge, you can block or delete cookies by selecting Settings > Privacy > Advanced Settings > Cookies. Please refer to your browser's privacy or help documentation to find Instructions for blocking or deleting cookies in other browsers.Certain features of Microsoft products depend on cookies. If you choose to block cookies, you cannot sign in or use some of those features, and preferences that are dependent on cookies will be lost.

Additional privacy controls that can impact cookies, including the Tracking Protection feature of Microsoft browsers, are described in the How to access and control your personal data section of this privacy statement. Our use of web beacons and analytics servicesSome Microsoft webpages contain electronic tags known as web beacons that we use to help deliver cookies on our websites, count users who have visited those websites, and deliver co-branded products. We also include web beacons or similar technologies in our electronic communications to determine whether you open and act on them.In addition to placing web beacons on our own websites, we sometimes work with other companies to place our web beacons on their websites or in their advertisements. This helps us develop statistics on how often clicking on an advertisement on a Microsoft website results in a purchase or other action on the advertiser's website. Finally, Microsoft products often contain web beacons or similar technologies from third-party analytics providers, which help us compile aggregated statistics about the effectiveness of our promotional campaigns or other operations. These technologies enable the analytics providers to set or read their own cookies or other identifiers on your device, through which they can collect information about your online activities across applications, websites, or other products. However, we prohibit these analytics providers from using web beacons on our sites to collect or access information that directly identifies you (such as your name or email address). You can opt out of data collection or use by some of these analytics providers by clicking any of the following links: Adjust, \r\nAppsFlyer, \r\nClicktale, \r\nFlurry Analytics, \r\nGoogle Analytics (requires you to install a browser add-on), \r\nKissmetrics, \r\nMixpanel, \r\nNielsen, \r\nVisible Measures, or \r\nWebTrends.\r\nOther similar technologiesIn addition to standard cookies and web beacons, our products can also use other similar technologies to store and read data files on your computer. This is typically done to maintain your preferences or to improve speed and performance by storing certain files locally. But, like standard cookies, these technologies can also store a unique identifier for your computer, which can then track behavior. These technologies include Local Shared Objects (or \"Flash cookies\") and Silverlight Application Storage.Local Shared Objects or \"Flash cookies.\" Websites that use Adobe Flash technologies can use Local Shared Objects or \"Flash cookies\" to store data on your computer.

Signing in to your Microsoft account enables personalization and consistent experiences across products and devices, permits you to use cloud data storage, allows you to make payments using payment instruments stored in your Microsoft account, and enables other features.\r\n\r\n    There are three types of Microsoft account:\r\n---When you create your own Microsoft account tied to your personal email address, we refer to that account as a personal Microsoft account. ---When you or your organization (such as an employer or your school) create your Microsoft account tied to your email address provided by that organization, we refer to that account as a work or school account. ---When you or your service provider (such as a cable or internet service provider) create your Microsoft account tied to your email address with your service provider\u2019s domain, we refer to that account as a third-party account. \r\n    If you sign into a service offered by a third party with your Microsoft account, you will share with that third party the account data required by that service.\r\nFull textWith a Microsoft account, you can sign into Microsoft products, as well as those of select Microsoft partners. Personal data associated with your Microsoft account includes credentials, name and contact data, payment data, device and usage data, your contacts, information about your activities, and your interests and favorites. Signing into your Microsoft account enables personalization, consistent experiences across products and devices, permits you to use cloud data storage, allows you to make payments using payment instruments stored in your Microsoft account, and enables other features. There are three types of Microsoft account:---When you create your own Microsoft account tied to your personal email address, we refer to that account as a personal Microsoft account. ---When you or your organization (such as an employer or your school) create your Microsoft account tied to your email address provided by that organization, we refer to that account as a work or school account. ---When you or your service provider (such as a cable or internet service provider) create your Microsoft account tied to your email address with your service provider\u2019s domain, we refer to that account as a third-party account. Personal Microsoft accounts. The data associated with your personal Microsoft account, and how that data is used, depends on how you use the account.---Creating your Microsoft account. When you create a personal Microsoft account, you will be asked to provide certain personal data and we will assign a unique ID number to identify your account and associated information. While some products, such as those involving payment, require a real name, you can sign in to and use other Microsoft products without providing your real name. Some data you provide, such as your display name, email address, and phone number, can be used to help others find and connect with you within Microsoft products. For example, people who know your display name, email address, or phone number can use it to search for you on Skype and send you an invite to connect with them. Note that if you use a work or school email address to create a personal Microsoft account, your employer or school may gain access to your data. In some cases, you will need to change the email address to a personal email address in order to continue accessing consumer-oriented products (such \r\n        as Xbox Live). ---Signing in to Microsoft account. When you sign in to your Microsoft account, we create a record of your sign-in, which includes the date and time, information about the product you signed in to, your sign-in name, the unique number assigned to your account, a unique identifier assigned to your device, your IP address, and your operating system and browser version.---Signing in to Microsoft products. Signing in to your account enables improved personalization, provides seamless and consistent experiences across products and devices, permits you to access and use cloud data storage, allows you to make payments using payment instruments stored in your Microsoft account, and enables other enhanced features and settings. When you sign in to your account, you will stay signed in until you sign out. If you add your Microsoft account to a Windows device (version 8 or higher), Windows will automatically sign you in to products that use Microsoft account when you access those products on that device. When you are signed in, some products will display your name or username and your profile photo (if you have added one to your profile) as part of your use of Microsoft products, including in your communications, social interactions, and public posts.---Signing in to third-party products. If you sign in to a third-party product with your Microsoft account, you will share data with the third party in accordance with the third party\u2019s privacy policy. The third party will also receive the version number assigned to your account (a new version number is assigned each time you change your sign-in data); and information that describes whether your account has been deactivated. If you share your profile data, the third party can display your name or user name and your profile photo (if you have added one to your profile) when you are signed in to that third-party product. If you chose to make payments to third-party merchants using your Microsoft account, Microsoft will pass information stored in your Microsoft account to the third party or its vendors (e.g., payment processors) as necessary to process your payment and fulfill your order (such as name, credit card number, billing and shipping addresses, and relevant contact information). The third party can use or share the data it receives when you sign in or make a purchase according to its own practices and policies. You should carefully review the privacy statement for each product you sign in to and each merchant you purchase from to determine how it will use the data it collects.Work or school accounts. The data associated with a work or school account, and how it will be used, is generally similar to the use and collection of data associated with a personal Microsoft account.If your employer or school uses Azure Active Directory (AAD) to manage the account it provides you, you can use your work or school account to sign in to Microsoft products, such as Office 365, and third-party products provided to you by your organization. If required by your organization, you will also be asked to provide a phone number or an alternative email address for additional security verification. And, if allowed by your organization, you may also use your work or school account to sign in to Microsoft or third-party products that you acquire for yourself.If you sign in to Microsoft products with a work or school account, note:---The owner of the domain associated with your email address may control and administer your account, and access and process your data, including the contents of your communications and files, including data stored in products provided to you by your organization, and products you acquire by yourself.---Your use of the products is subject to your organization\u2019s policies, if any. You should consider both your organization\u2019s policies and whether you are comfortable enabling your organization to access your data before you choose to use your work or school account to sign in to products you acquire for yourself. ---If you lose access to your work or school account (if you change employers, for example), you may lose access to products, including content associated with those products, you acquired on your own behalf if you used your work or school account to sign in to such products.---Microsoft is not responsible for the privacy or security practices of your organization, which may differ from those of Microsoft.---If your organization is administering your use of Microsoft products, please direct your privacy inquiries, including any requests to exercise your data subject rights, to your administrator. See also the Notice to end users section of this privacy statement. Third-party accounts. The data associated with a third-party Microsoft account, and how it will be used, is generally similar to the use and collection of data associated with a personal Microsoft account.  Your service provider has control over your account, including the ability to access or delete your account. You should carefully review the terms the third party provided you to understand what it can do with your account.Other important privacy informationmainotherimportantprivacyinformationmoduleSummaryBelow you will find additional privacy information, such as how we secure your data, where we process your data, and how long we retain your data.

If third-party agents process personal data on our behalf in a manner inconsistent with the principles of either Privacy Shield framework, we remain liable unless we prove we are not responsible for the event giving rise to the damage. The controlled U.S. subsidiaries of Microsoft Corporation, as identified in our self-certification submission, also adhere to the Privacy Shield Principles\u2014for more info, see the list of Microsoft U.S. entities or subsidiaries adhering to the Privacy Shield Principles.\r\n    If there is any conflict between the terms in this privacy policy and the Privacy Shield Principles, the Privacy Shield Principles shall govern. To learn more about the Privacy Shield program, and to view our certification, visit the Privacy Shield website.\r\n    If you have a question or complaint related to participation by Microsoft in the EU-U.S. or Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield, we encourage you to contact us via our web form. For any complaints related to the Privacy Shield frameworks that Microsoft cannot resolve directly, we have chosen to cooperate with the relevant EU Data Protection Authority, or a panel established by the European data protection authorities, for resolving disputes with EU individuals, and with the Swiss Federal Data Protection and Information Commissioner (FDPIC) for resolving disputes with Swiss individuals. Please contact us if you\u2019d like us to direct you to your data protection authority contacts. As further explained in the Privacy Shield Principles, binding arbitration is available to address residual complaints not resolved by other \r\n    means. Microsoft is subject to the investigatory and enforcement powers of the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC). Our retention of personal datamainOurretentionofpersonaldatamoduleSummaryMicrosoft retains personal data for as long as necessary to provide the products and fulfill the transactions you have requested, or for other legitimate purposes such as complying with our legal obligations, resolving disputes, and enforcing our agreements. Because these needs can vary for different data types, the context of our interactions with you or your use of products, actual retention periods can vary significantly.Other criteria used to determine the retention periods include:---Do customers provide, create, or maintain the data with the expectation we will retain it until they affirmatively remove it? Examples include a document you store in OneDrive, or an email message you keep in your Outlook.com inbox. In such cases, we would aim to maintain the data until you actively delete it, such as by moving an email from your Outlook.com inbox to the Deleted Items folder, and then emptying that folder (when your Deleted Items folder is emptied, those emptied items remain in our system for up to 30 days before final deletion). (Note that there may be other reasons why the data has to be deleted sooner, for example if you exceed limits on how much data can be stored in your account.)---Is there an automated control, such as in the Microsoft privacy dashboard, that enables the customer to access and delete the personal data at any time? If there is not, a shortened data retention time will generally be adopted.---Is the personal data of a sensitive type? If so, a shortened retention time would generally be adopted. ---Has Microsoft adopted and announced a specific retention period for a certain data type? For example, for Bing search queries, we de-identify stored queries by removing the entirety of the IP address after 6 months, and cookie IDs and other cross-session identifiers after 18 months.---Has the user provided consent for a longer retention period? If so, we will retain data in accordance with your consent.---Is Microsoft subject to a legal, contractual, or similar obligation to retain or delete the data? Examples can include mandatory data retention laws in the applicable jurisdiction, government orders to preserve data relevant to an investigation, or data retained for the purposes of litigation. Conversely, if we are required by law to remove unlawful content, we will do so.AdvertisingmainadvertisingmoduleSummaryAdvertising allows us to provide, support, and improve some of our products. Microsoft does not use what you say in email, chat, video calls or voice mail, or your documents, photos, or other personal files to target ads to you. We use other data, detailed below, for advertising in our products and on third-party properties. For example:---Microsoft may use data we collect to select and deliver some of the ads you see on Microsoft web properties, such as Microsoft.com, MSN, and Bing.---When the advertising ID is enabled in Windows 10 as part of your privacy settings, third parties can access and use the advertising ID (much the same way that websites can access and use a unique identifier stored in a cookie) to select and deliver ads in such apps.---We may share data we collect with third parties, such as Oath, AppNexus, or Facebook (see below), so that the ads you see in our products, their products, or other sites and apps serviced by these partners are more relevant and valuable to you. ---Advertisers may choose to place our web beacons on their sites, or use similar technologies, in order to allow Microsoft to collect information on their sites such as activities, purchases, and visits; we use this data on behalf of our advertising customers to provide ads. The ads that you see may be selected based on data we process about you, such as your interests and favorites, your location, your transactions, how you use our products, your search queries, or the content you view. For example, if you view content on MSN about automobiles, we may show advertisements about cars; if you search \u201cpizza places in Seattle\u201d on Bing, you may see advertisements in your search results for restaurants in Seattle.The ads that you see may also be selected based on other information learned about you over time using demographic data, location data, search queries, interests and favorites, usage data from our products and sites, as well as the sites and apps of our advertisers and partners. We refer to these ads as \"interest-based advertising\" in this statement. For example, if you view gaming content on xbox.com, you may see offers for games on MSN. To provide interest-based advertising, we combine cookies placed on your device using information that we collect (such as IP address) when your browser interacts with our websites. If you opt out of receiving interest-based advertising, data associated with these cookies will not be used.Further details regarding our advertising-related uses of data include:---Advertising industry best practices and commitments. Microsoft is a member of the Network Advertising Initiative (NAI) and adheres to the NAI Code of Conduct. We also adhere to the following self-regulatory programs:\r\n        In the US: Digital Advertising Alliance (DAA)In Europe: European Interactive Digital Advertising Alliance (EDAA)In Canada: Ad Choices: Digital Advertising Alliance of Canada (DAAC) / Choix de Pub: l'Alliance de la publicit\u00e9 num\u00e9rique du Canada (DAAC)---Health-related ad targeting. In the United States, we provide interest-based advertising based on a limited number of standard, non-sensitive health-related interest categories, including allergies, arthritis, cholesterol, cold and flu, diabetes, gastrointestinal health, headache / migraine, healthy eating, healthy heart, men\u2019s health, oral health, osteoporosis, skin health, sleep, and vision / eye care. We will also target ads based on custom, non-sensitive health-related interest categories as requested by advertisers.---Children and advertising. We do not deliver interest-based advertising to children whose birthdate in their Microsoft account identifies them as under 16 years of age.---Data retention. For interest-based advertising, we retain data for no more than 13 months, unless we obtain your consent to retain the data longer.---Data sharing. In some cases, we share with advertisers reports about the data we have collected on their sites or ads. Data collected by other advertising companies. Advertisers sometimes include their own web beacons (or those of their other advertising partners) within their advertisements that we display, enabling them to set and read their own cookie. Additionally, Microsoft partners with third-party ad companies to help provide some of our advertising services, and we also allow other third-party ad companies to display advertisements on our sites. These third parties may place cookies on your computer and collect data about your online activities across websites or online services. These companies currently include, but are not limited to: A9, AppNexus, Criteo, Facebook, MediaMath, nugg.adAG, Oath, Rocket Fuel, and Yahoo!. Select any of the preceding links to find more information on each company's practices, including the choices it offers. Many of these companies are also members of the NAI or DAA, which each provide a simple way to opt out of ad targeting from participating companies.Collection of data from childrenmaincollectionofdatafromchildrenmoduleSummary\r\n    When a Microsoft product collects age, and there is an age in your jurisdiction under which parental consent or authorization is required to use the product, the product will either block users under that age or will ask them to provide consent or authorization from a parent or guardian before they can use it. We will not knowingly ask children under that age to provide more data than is necessary to provide for the product.\r\n\r\n    Once parental consent or authorization is granted, the child's account is treated much like any other account. The child can access communication services, like Outlook and Skype, and can freely communicate and share data with other users of all ages.\r\n    Parents can change or revoke the consent choices previously made, and review, edit, or request the deletion of the personal data of children for whom they provided consent or authorization. For example, parents can access their personal Microsoft account and select Permissions. For users of Minecraft for PC/Java and other Mojang games, parents can visit the Mojang Account page.Preview or free-of-charge releasesmainpreviewreleasesmoduleSummaryMicrosoft offers preview, insider, beta or other free-of-charge products and features (\"previews\") to enable you to evaluate them while providing Microsoft with data about your use of the product, including feedback and device and usage data. As a result, previews can automatically collect additional data, provide fewer controls, and otherwise employ different privacy and security measures than those typically present in our products. If you participate in previews, we may contact you about your feedback or your interest in continuing to use the product after general release.Changes to this privacy statementmainchangestothisprivacystatementmoduleSummary\r\n    We update this privacy statement when necessary to provide greater transparency or in response to:---Feedback from customer, regulators, industry, or other stakeholders.---Changes in our products.---Changes in our data processing activities or policies.\r\n    When we post changes to this statement, we will revise the \"last updated\" date at the top of the statement and describe the changes on the Change history page. If there are material changes to the statement, such as a change to the purposes of processing of personal data that is not consistent with the purpose for which it was originally collected, we will notify you either by prominently posting a notice of such changes before they take effect or by directly sending you a notification. We encourage you to periodically review this privacy statement to learn how Microsoft is protecting your information.How to contact usmainhowtocontactusmoduleSummaryIf you have a privacy concern, complaint, or question for the Microsoft Chief Privacy Officer or EU Data Protection Officer, please contact us by using our web form.

They include:\r\n---Cloud services, referred to as Online Services in the Microsoft Online Services Terms (OST), such as Office 365, Microsoft Azure, Microsoft Dynamics365, Microsoft Intune, and Microsoft Azure Stack, for which an organization (our customer) contracts with Microsoft for the services (\u201cEnterprise Online Services\u201d). ---Other enterprise and developer cloud-based services, such as PlayFab Services. ---Server and developer products, such as Windows Server, SQL Server, Visual Studio, and System Center (\u201cEnterprise and Developer Software\u201d).---Appliances and hardware used for storage infrastructure, such as StorSimple (\u201cEnterprise Appliances\u201d).---Developer services such as Bot Framework, Cortana Skills Kit, and Botlet Store.---Professional services referred to in the OST that are available with Enterprise Online Services, such as onboarding services, data migration services, data science services, or services to supplement existing features in the Enterprise Online Services.In the event of a conflict between this Microsoft privacy statement and the terms of any agreement(s) between a customer and Microsoft for Enterprise and Developer Products, the terms of those agreement(s) will control.You can also learn more about our Enterprise and Developer Products\u2019 features and settings, including choices that impact your privacy or your end users\u2019 privacy, in product documentation.\r\n    If any of the terms below are not defined in this Privacy Statement or the OST, they have the definitions below.\r\nGeneral. When a customer tries, purchases, uses, or subscribes to Enterprise and Developer Products, or obtains support for or professional services with such products, Microsoft collects data to provide the service (including uses compatible with providing the service), provide the best experiences with our products, operate our business, and communicate with the customer. For example:\r\n---When a customer engages with a Microsoft sales representative, we collect the customer\u2019s name and contact data, along with information about the customer\u2019s organization, to support that engagement.---When a customer interacts with a Microsoft support professional, we collect device and usage data or error reports to diagnose and resolve problems.---When a customer pays for products, we collect contact and payment data to process the payment.---When Microsoft sends communications to a customer, we use data to personalize the content of the communication.---When a customer engages with Microsoft for professional services, we collect the name and contact data of the customer\u2019s designated point of contact and use information provided by the customer to perform the services that the customer has requested.\r\n    The Enterprise and Developer Products enable you to purchase, subscribe to, or use other products and online services from Microsoft or third parties with different privacy practices, and those other products and online services are governed by their respective privacy statements and policies.\r\nEnterprise online servicesmainenterpriseservicesmoduleSummary\r\n    To provide the Enterprise Online Services, Microsoft collects Customer Data, Administrator Data, Payment Data, and Support Data.\r\n\r\n    We use Customer Data, Support Data, and Personal Data as described in the OST and the Microsoft Trust Center. Customer is the controller of Personal Data and Microsoft is the processor of such data, except when (a) Customer acts as a processor of Personal Data, in which case Microsoft is a subprocessor or (b) stated otherwise in the OST.Administrator Data is the information provided to Microsoft during sign-up, purchase, or administration of Enterprise Online Services. We use Administrator Data to provide the Enterprise Online Services, complete transactions, service the account, detect and prevent fraud, and comply with our legal obligations. Administrator Data includes the name, address, phone number, and email address you provide, as well as aggregated usage data related to your account, such as the controls you select. Administrator Data also includes contact information of your colleagues and friends if you agree to provide it to Microsoft for the limited purpose of sending them \r\n    an invitation to use the Enterprise Online Services; we contact those individuals with communications that include information about you, such as your name and profile photo.\r\n    As needed, we use Administrator Data to contact you to provide information about your account, subscriptions, billing, and updates to the Enterprise Online Services, including information about new features, security, or other technical issues. We also contact you regarding third-party inquiries we receive regarding use of the Enterprise Online Services, as described in your agreement. You cannot unsubscribe from these non-promotional communications. We may also contact you regarding information and offers about other products and services, or share your contact information with Microsoft's partners. When such a partner has specific services or solutions to meet your needs, or to optimize your use of the Enterprise Online Services, we may share limited, aggregated information about your organization\u2019s account with the partner. Microsoft will not share your confidential information or contact information with the authorized partner unless we have sufficient rights to do so. You can manage \r\n    your contact preferences or update your information in your account profile.\r\n    We use payment data to complete transactions, as well as to detect and prevent fraud.\r\n    Some Enterprise Online Services require, or are enhanced by, the installation of local software (e.g., agents, device management applications) on a device. At your direction, the local software may transmit (i) data, which can include Customer Data, from a device or appliance to or from the Enterprise Online Services; or (ii) logs or error reports to Microsoft for troubleshooting purposes. The Enterprise Online Services, including local software, collect device and usage data that is transmitted to Microsoft and analyzed to improve the quality, security, and integrity of our products.Bing Search Services, as defined in the OST, use data such as search queries as described in the Bing section of this privacy statement.\r\nEnterprise and developer software and enterprise appliancesmainenterprisedevsoftwareappsmoduleSummaryEnterprise and developer software and enterprise appliances collect data to operate effectively and provide you the best experiences. The data we collect depends on the features you use, as well as your configuration and settings, but it is generally limited to device and usage data. Customers have choices about the data they provide. Here are examples of the data we collect:---During installation or when you upgrade an enterprise and developer software, we may collect device and usage data to learn whether you experience any difficulties.---When you use enterprise software or enterprise appliances, we may collect device and usage data to learn about your operating environment to improve security features.---When you experience a crash using enterprise software or enterprise appliances, you may choose to send Microsoft an error report to help us diagnose the problem and deliver customer support.\r\n    Microsoft uses the data we collect from enterprise and developer software and enterprise appliances to provide and improve our products, to deliver customer support, to activate the product, to communicate with you, and to operate our business.\r\n\r\n    Microsoft SQL Server is a relational database management platform and includes products that can be installed separately (such as SQL Server Management Studio). For detailed information about what data we collect, how we use it, and how to manage your privacy options, visit the  \r\n    SQL Server privacy page. \r\n    If you work in an organization, your administrator can set certain telemetry settings in SQL Server via Group Policy.\r\nProductivity and communications productsmainprodcommproductsmoduleSummaryProductivity and communications products are applications, software, and services you can use to create, store, and share documents, as well as communicate with others.OfficemainofficeservicesmoduleSummary\r\n    Office is a collection of productivity services and applications including Word, Excel, PowerPoint, and Outlook, among others. For more details about Outlook, see the Outlook section of this privacy statement. Office is a service that is comprised of client software applications and connected online services that span many platforms and have numerous interdependent experiences. Various Office services enable you to use your file content for designs and recommendations, collaborate with others within your documents, and provide you functionality from other Microsoft products, such as Bing and third-party connected products. If you work in an organization, your administrator may turn off or disable these connected services. Prior to Office 365 version 1904, you can change your privacy settings in the Privacy Options of the Microsoft Office Trust Center. For more information, see View my options and settings in the Microsoft Office Trust Center. Starting with Version 1904 of Office 365, \r\n    you can access new, updated, and improved privacy controls by selecting File > Account > Account Privacy. See Account Privacy Settings for more information.\r\nOffice Roaming Service. The Office Roaming Service helps keep your Office settings up to date across your devices running Office. When you sign in to Office with your Microsoft account or an account issued by your organization, the Office Client Policy Service is turned on and syncs some of your customized Office settings to Microsoft servers (such as a list of most recently used documents and the last location viewed within a document). When you sign in to Office on another device with the same account, the Office Roaming Service downloads your settings from Microsoft servers and applies them to the additional device. The Office Roaming Service also applies some of your customized Office settings when you sign in to Office.com. When you sign out of Office, the Office Roaming Service removes your Office settings from your device. Any changes you made to your customized Office settings are sent to Microsoft servers.Microsoft Updates. Office uses either Microsoft Update or Click-to-Run services to provide you with security and other important updates. See the Update Services section of this privacy statement for more information about Microsoft Update.Click-to-Run Update Service. The Click-to-Run Update Service allows you to install certain Microsoft Office products over the internet. The Click-to-Run Update Service also automatically detects online updates to Click-to-Run-enabled products on your device and downloads and installs them automatically.Diagnostic Data. Diagnostic data is used to (i) keep Office secure and up to date; (ii) detect, diagnose, and remediate problems; and (iii) make product improvements. This data does not include a user's name or email address, the content of the user's files, or information about apps unrelated to Office. Users have a choice between two different levels of diagnostic data collection, Required and Optional. ---Required. The minimum data necessary to help keep Office secure, up to date, and performing as expected on the device it's installed on.\r\n        ---Optional. Additional data that helps us make product improvements and provides enhanced information to help us detect, diagnose, and remediate issues.\r\n    See Diagnostic Data in Office for more information.\r\nConnected Experiences. Office continues to provide more experiences in client applications that are connected to and backed by cloud-based services. In order to ensure that all these connected experiences will be reliable, up to date, remain secure, and perform as expected, necessary service data may be collected whenever you use a connected experience.\r\n\r\n    Office consists of client software applications and connected experiences designed to enable you to create, communicate, and collaborate more effectively. Working with others on a document stored on OneDrive for Business or translating the contents of a Word document into a different language are examples of connected experiences. There are two types of connected experiences. ---Experiences that analyze your content. Experiences that use your Office content to provide you with design recommendations, editing suggestions, data insights, and similar features. For example, PowerPoint Designer or Editor in Word.---Experiences that download online content. Experiences that allow you to search and download online content including templates, images, 3D models, videos, and reference materials to enhance your documents. For example, Office templates or PowerPoint QuickStarter. \r\n    Prior to Office 365 version 1904, you can change your privacy settings in the Privacy Options of the Microsoft Office Trust Center.\r\n    Starting with Version 1904 of Office 365, you can access new, updated, and improved privacy controls by selecting File > Account > Account Privacy. These privacy settings allow you to configure your connected experiences. For example, you can choose to enable connected experiences that download online content, but not connected experiences that analyze content. Turning off connected experiences will also turn off additional experiences, such as document co-authoring and online file storage. But even if you use this privacy setting to turn off connected experiences, certain Office functionality will remain available, such as syncing your mailbox in Outlook, as well as essential services described below.\r\n\r\n    If you choose to disable certain types of connected experiences, either the ribbon or menu command for those connected experiences will be grayed out or you will get an error message when you try to use those connected experiences.\r\n\r\n    There are a set of services that are essential to how Office functions and cannot be disabled. For example, the licensing service that confirms that you are properly licensed to use Office is essential. Necessary service data about these services is collected and sent to Microsoft, regardless of any other settings that you have configured. See\r\nEssential Services for more information. Necessary service data for connected experiences\r\n    Necessary service data is data that enables us to deliver cloud-based connected experiences and help make these experiences secure and perform as expected. There are three types of information that are considered as necessary service data. ---Customer Content, which is content you create using Office, such as text typed in a Word document. ---Functional Data, which includes information needed by a connected experience to perform its task, such as configuration information about the app. ---Service Diagnostic Data, which is the data necessary to keep the service secure, up to date, and performing as expected. Because this data is strictly related to the connected experience, it is separate from Required or Optional diagnostic data levels. \r\n    To help you understand necessary service data, the following is an example scenario using PowerPoint Designer, which is a connected experience you can use when creating slides for a presentation. PowerPoint Designer helps you improve your slides by automatically generating design ideas to choose from. While you're putting content on a slide, Designer works in the background to match that content to professionally designed layouts. \r\n    The necessary service data that is sent to Microsoft to enable this connected experience for you could include the following: ---Customer content, such as the text or images you added to your slide. ---Functional data, such as which slide you are working on and its layout. ---Service diagnostic data, such as events that tell us if the design idea was correctly applied to your slide and that the service calls were performing correctly. \r\n    If you choose to disable the category of connected experiences that includes PowerPoint Designer, the feature will be turned off and none of this necessary service data is sent to us. See Connected Experiences in Office for more information OneDrivemainonedrivemoduleSummary\r\n    OneDrive lets you store and access your files on virtually any device. You can also share and collaborate on your files with others. Some versions of the OneDrive application enable you to access both your personal OneDrive by signing in with your personal Microsoft account and your OneDrive for Business by signing in with your work or school Microsoft account as part of your organization's use of Office 365.\r\n\r\n    When you use OneDrive, we collect data about your usage of the service, as well as the content you store, to provide, improve, and protect the services. Examples include indexing the contents of your OneDrive documents so that you can search for them later and using location information to enable you to search for photos based on where the photo was taken. We also collect device information so we can deliver personalized experiences, such as enabling you to sync content across devices and roam customized settings.\r\n\r\n    When you store content in OneDrive, that content will inherit the sharing permissions of the folder in which you store it. For example, if you decide to store content in the public folder, the content will be public and available to anyone on the internet who can find the folder. If you store content in a private folder, the content will be private.\r\n\r\n    When you share content to a social network like Facebook from a device that you have synced with your OneDrive account, your content is either uploaded to that social network, or a link to that content is posted to that social network. Doing this makes the content accessible to anyone on that social network. To delete the content, you need to delete it from the social network (if it was uploaded there, rather than a link to it) and from OneDrive.\r\n\r\n    When you share your OneDrive content with your friends via a link, an email with the link is sent to those friends. The link contains an authorization code that allows anyone with the link to access your content. If one of your friends sends the link to other people, they will also be able to access your content, even if you did not choose to share the content with them. To revoke permissions for your content on OneDrive, sign in to your account and then select the specific content to manage the permission levels. Revoking permissions for a link effectively deactivates the link. No one will be able to use the link to access the content unless you decide to share the link again.\r\n\r\n    Files managed with OneDrive for Business are stored separately from files stored with your personal OneDrive. OneDrive for Business collects and transmits personal data for authentication, such as your email address and password, which will be transmitted to Microsoft and/or to the provider of your Office 365 service.\r\nOutlookmainoutlookmoduleSummaryOutlook products are designed to improve your productivity through improved communications and include Outlook.com, Outlook applications, and related services.Outlook.com. Outlook.com is the primary consumer email service from Microsoft and includes email accounts with addresses that end in outlook.com, live.com, hotmail.com, and msn.com. Outlook.com provides features that let you connect with your friends on social networks. You will need to create a Microsoft account to use Outlook.com.When you delete an email or item from a mailbox in Outlook.com, the item generally goes into your Deleted Items folder where it remains for approximately 7 days unless you move it back to your inbox, you empty the folder, or the service empties the folder automatically, whichever comes first. When the Deleted Items folder is emptied, those emptied items remain in our system for up to 30 days before final deletion, unless we are legally required to retain the data for longer.Outlook applications. Outlook client applications are software you install on your device that permits you to manage email, calendar items, files, contacts, and other data from email, file storage, and other services, like Exchange Online or Outlook.com, or servers, like Microsoft Exchange. You can use multiple accounts from different providers, including third-party providers, with Outlook applications.To add an account, you must provide permission for Outlook to access data from the email or file storage services.When you add an account to Outlook, your mail, calendar items, files, contacts, settings and other data from that account will automatically sync to your device. If you are using the mobile Outlook application, that data will also sync to Microsoft servers to enable additional features such as faster search, personalized filtering of less important mail, and an ability to add email attachments from linked file storage providers without leaving the Outlook application. If you are using the desktop Outlook application, you can choose whether to allow the data to sync to our servers. At any time, you can remove an account or make changes to the data that is synced from your account.If you add an account provided by an organization (such as your employer or school), the owner of the organizational domain can implement policies and controls (for example, requiring multi-factor authentication or the ability to remotely wipe data from your device) that can affect your use of Outlook.To learn more about the data the Outlook applications collect and process, please see the Office section of this privacy statement.SkypemainskypemoduleSummary\r\n    Skype lets you send and receive voice, video, and instant message communications. This section applies to the consumer version of Skype; if you are using Skype for Business, see the Enterprise and developer products section of this privacy statement.\r\n\r\n    As part of providing these features, Microsoft collects usage data about your communications that includes the time and date of the communication and the numbers or user names that are part of the communication.\r\nSkype profile. Your Skype profile includes information you provided when you set up a Microsoft account. To enable other people to find you on Skype (or products that interact with Skype, such as Skype for Business), depending on your profile settings, your Skype profile is included in the Skype public search directory and may be recommended to other users. Your profile includes your user name, avatar, and any other data you choose to add to your profile or display to others.\r\nSkype Contacts. If you use a Microsoft service, such as Outlook.com, to manage contacts, Skype will automatically add the people you know to your Skype contact list until you tell us to stop. With your permission, Skype will also check your device or other address books from time to time to automatically add your friends as Skype contacts. You can block users if you don\u2019t want to receive their communications.\r\nPartner companies. To make Skype available to more people, we partner with other companies to allow Skype to be offered via those companies\u2019 services. If you use Skype through a company other than Microsoft, that company\u2019s privacy policy governs how it handles your data. To comply with applicable law or respond to valid legal process, or to help our partner company or local operator comply or respond, we may access, transfer, disclose, and preserve your data. That data could include, for example, your private content, such as the content of your instant messages, stored video messages, voicemails, or file transfers.\r\nSkype Manager. Skype Manager lets you manage a group\u2019s (such as your family\u2019s) Skype usage from one central place. When you set up a group, you will be the Skype Manager Administrator and can see the patterns of usage, including detailed information, like traffic data and details of purchases, of other members of the group who have consented to such access. If you add information like your name, other people in the group will be able to see it. Members of the group can withdraw consent for Skype Manager by visiting their Skype account page.\r\nPush notifications. To let you know of incoming calls, chats, and other messages, Skype apps use the notification service on your device. For many devices, these services are provided by another company. To tell you who is calling, for example, or to give you the first few words of the new chat, Skype has to tell the notification service so that they can provide the notification to you. The company providing the notification service on your device will use this information in accordance with their own terms and privacy policy. Microsoft is not responsible for the data collected by the company providing the notification service. If you don\u2019t want to use the notification services for incoming Skype calls and messages, turn it off in the settings found in the Skype application or your device.\r\nSkype advertising. Some Skype software includes interest-based advertising, so that you\u2019re more likely to see ads you\u2019ll like. In some versions of the software, you can opt out of interest-based advertising in the privacy options or account settings menu. If you sign in to Skype with a Microsoft account, you can opt out of interest-based advertising on the Microsoft privacy dashboard. If you opt out, you\u2019ll still see ads displayed in the Skype software based on your country of residence, language preference, and IP address location, but other data is not used for ad targeting.\r\nTranslation features. To help you communicate with people in different languages, some Skype apps offer audio and/or text translation features. When you use translation features, your voice and text data are used to provide and improve Microsoft speech recognition and translation services.\r\nRecording features. Some versions of Skype have a recording feature that allows you to capture and share all or part of your audio / video call. The recording will be stored and shared as part of your conversation history with the person or group with whom the call occurred. You should understand your legal responsibilities before recording any communication. This includes whether you need to get consent from all parties to the communication in advance. Microsoft is not responsible for how you use your recordings or the recording features.\r\nSkype bots. Bots are programs offered by Microsoft or third parties that can do many useful things like search for news, play games, and more. Depending on their capabilities, bots may have access to your display name, Skype ID, country, region, language, and any messages, audio, video, or content that you share with the bot. Please review the bot profile and its privacy statement before engaging in a one-to-one or group conversation with a bot. You can delete a bot that you no longer wish to engage with. Prior to adding a bot to a group, please ensure that your group participants have consented to their information being shared with the bot.\r\nCortana in Skype. Subject to availability, you can use Cortana in Skype to help manage your time and tasks, find information, and get things done using Microsoft and third-party services. Cortana works best when you give her permission to use data, such as your location and IM conversations from Skype to personalize experiences across Microsoft products that offer Cortana functionality. If you choose not to give permission, Cortana may still provide you with non-personalized suggestions and responses within Skype.\r\nCaptioning. Certain Skype features include accessibility functionality such as captioning. During Skype calls, a call participant can activate a voice-to-text feature, which allows the user to view the audio chat as text. If a user activates this feature, other call participants will not receive a notification. Microsoft uses this voice and text data to provide captioning of audio for users and to improve Microsoft speech recognition and related services.\r\nLinkedInmainlinkedinmoduleSummaryTo learn about the data LinkedIn collects and how it is used and shared, please see LinkedIn\u2019s Privacy Policy.Search and artificial intelligencemainsearchaimoduleSummarySearch and artificial intelligence products connect you with information and intelligently sense, process, and act on information\u2014learning and adapting over time.BingmainbingmoduleSummary\r\n    Bing services include search and mapping services, as well as the Bing Toolbar and Bing Desktop apps. Bing services collect and process data in many forms, including text that has been inked or typed, speech data, and images. Bing services are also included within other Microsoft services, such as MSN Apps, Office, Cortana, and certain features in Windows (which we refer to as Bing-powered experiences).\r\n\r\n    When you conduct a search, or use a feature of a Bing-powered experience that involves conducting a search or entering a command on your behalf, Microsoft will collect the searches or commands you provide (which may be in the form of text, voice data, or an image), along with your IP address, location, the unique identifiers contained in our cookies or similar technologies, the time and date of your search, and your browser configuration. For example, if you use Bing voice-enabled services, your voice input and performance data associated with the speech functionality will be sent to Microsoft. And, if you use Bing image-enabled services, the image you provide will be sent to Microsoft. When you use Bing-powered experiences, such as Ask Cortana or Bing Lookup to search a particular word or phrase within a webpage or document, that word or phrase is sent to Bing along with some surrounding content in order to provide contextually relevant search results.\r\nSearch suggestions. For the search suggestions feature, the characters that you type into a Bing-powered experience to conduct a search will be sent to Microsoft. This allows us to provide you with suggestions as you type your searches. To turn this feature on or off, while using Bing Search, go to Bing Settings. Search Suggestions cannot be turned off in Cortana. On Windows, you can always hide Cortana and the search box so as not to use the feature.\r\nBing experience improvement program for Bing Desktop and Bing Toolbar. If you are using Bing Desktop or Bing Toolbar and choose to participate in the Bing Experience Improvement Program, we also collect additional data about how you use these specific Bing apps, such as the addresses of the websites you visit, to help improve search ranking and relevance. To help protect your privacy, we do not use the data collected through the Bing Experience Improvement Program to identify or contact you or target advertising to you. You can turn off the Bing Experience Improvement Program at any time in the Bing Desktop or Bing Toolbar settings. Finally, we delete the information collected through the Bing Experience Improvement Program after 18 months.\r\nRetention and de-identification. We de-identify stored search queries by removing the entirety of the IP address after 6 months, and cookie IDs and other cross-session identifiers after 18 months.\r\nPersonalization through Microsoft account. Some Bing services provide you with an enhanced experience when you sign in with your personal Microsoft account, for example, syncing your search history across devices. You can use these personalization features to customize your interests, favorites, and settings, and to connect your account with third-party services. Visit Bing Settings to manage your personalization settings, or the Microsoft privacy dashboard to manage your data.\r\nManaging search history. When you\u2019re signed-in to a personal Microsoft account, you can erase your search history on the Microsoft privacy dashboard. The Search History service from Bing, located in Bing Settings, provides another method of revisiting the search terms you've entered and results you've clicked when using Bing search through your browser. You may clear your search history on a device through this service. Clearing your history prevents that history from being displayed on the Search History site, but does not delete information from our search logs, which are retained and de-identified as described above or as you have instructed through the privacy dashboard.\r\nThird-party services that use Bing. You may access Bing-powered experiences when using third-party services, such as those from Yahoo!. In order to provide these services, Bing receives data from these and other partners, including your search query and related data (such as date, time, IP address, and a unique identifier). This data will be sent to Microsoft to provide the search service. Microsoft will use this data as described in this statement or as further limited by our contractual obligations with our partners. You should refer to the privacy policies of the third-party services for any questions about how they collect and use data.\r\nSearch query passed in referral URL. When you select a search result or advertisement from a Bing search results page and go to the destination website, the destination website will receive the standard data your browser sends to every web site you visit\u2014such as your IP address, browser type and language, and the URL of the site you came from (in this case, the Bing search results page). Because the URL of the Bing search results page contains the text of the search query you entered (which could include names, addresses, or other identifying information), the destination website will be able to determine the search term you entered.\r\n\r\n    If your browser is enabled to allow pages to pre-load in the background for faster performance, when your browser loads a page in the background, it will have the same effect as if you visited that page, including sending the Bing search results page URL (containing your search query) and downloading any cookies or similar technologies that page sets.\r\nSharing data from Bing and Bing-powered experiences with third parties. We share some de-identified data (data where the identity of a specific person is not known) from Bing and Bing-powered experiences with selected third parties. Before we do so, we run the data through a process designed to remove certain sensitive data that users may have included in the search terms themselves (such as social security numbers or credit card numbers). Additionally, we require these third parties to keep the data secure and to not use the data for purposes other than for which it is provided.\r\nCortanamaincortanamoduleSummary\r\n    Cortana is your intelligent assistant that provides smart features and personalized experiences across a variety of devices, apps, and services. As described below, the data we collect when you use Cortana depends on the choices you make (including your privacy settings and whether or not you are signed-in), the data you share with Cortana, and Cortana\u2019s capabilities (which vary depending on your operating system, device, and the services and apps you use). Cortana works best when you sign in and let her use data from your device, your Microsoft account, other Microsoft services, and third-party services to which you choose to connect.\r\n\r\n    You can manage what data Cortana uses, and what she knows about you in Cortana Settings, Permissions, and Notebook. More about Cortana\u2019s features and how to manage them can be found at Cortana and privacy.\r\n    The data Cortana collects is used to provide, improve, personalize, and develop Cortana and other Microsoft products. For example:---Cortana uses information about your interests to recommend features you may enjoy.---Cortana shares information with third parties at your direction to complete a task or transaction you\u2019ve requested, such as making a restaurant reservation or booking a ride share service.---Microsoft uses your voice data to improve speech recognition and user intent understanding to improve Cortana and other Microsoft products.\r\n    On Windows devices, if you choose not to sign in to Cortana, you can still chat with Cortana and use Cortana to search, using either your voice, inking, or typing. For more information, see the Windows Search section of this privacy statement. If you choose not to sign in to Cortana on Skype, you can still receive non-personalized suggestions and responses within Skype. See the Skype section of this privacy statement for more information.\r\n\r\n    When you use Cortana when you are signed out, we collect:---Voice data. To help Cortana better understand the way you speak and your voice commands, we collect voice data and use it to build speech models and improve speech recognition and user intent understanding. If you choose to sign in, the speech models are more personalized.---Searches and commands. We collect your searches and commands to provide, improve, and develop Cortana and other products. Your Bing search queries and the Search Suggestion feature, even if Cortana does the searching for you, are treated like any other Bing search queries and are used as described in the Bing section of this privacy statement.---Device and usage data. We collect information about your device as well as the hardware and software you use. For example, Cortana can access data about your device and how you use it. For instance, Cortana can determine if Bluetooth is on, whether you\u2019ve locked your screen, your alarm settings, and which apps you install and use.\r\n    If you sign in with your Microsoft account, you can enable Cortana to perform additional tasks and to provide personalized experiences and suggestions. Cortana can process the demographic data (such as your age, postal code, and gender) associated with your Microsoft account and data collected through other Microsoft services to provide personalized suggestions. For example, Cortana uses data collected by the Sports app to automatically display information about the teams you follow. Cortana also learns your favorite places from the Microsoft Maps app, and what you view and purchase in Microsoft Store to improve her suggestions. Your interests in Cortana's Notebook can be used by other Microsoft services, such as Bing or MSN, to customize your interests, preferences, and favorites in those experiences as well.\r\n    When you sign in to Cortana, in addition to the information described above, we also collect:Location data. You can choose whether Cortana processes your location information to give you the most relevant notices and results and to make suggestions that help save you time, such as local traffic information and location-based reminders. If you grant permission, Cortana will regularly collect and use your current location, location history, and other location signals (such as locations tagged on photos you upload to OneDrive). Location data Cortana collects is used to provide you with personalized experiences across our products, such as making Bing search results more relevant. It may also be used in de-identified form to improve the Windows Location Services. See more details in the Location services section of this privacy statement.Contacts, communications, and other inputs. You can choose to let Cortana collect and access your device and cloud-based email and other communications, your calendar, and your contacts to enable additional features and personalization. If you give permission, Cortana will collect and process additional data, including:---Contacts, text messages, and email. Cortana uses your contacts and messages to do a variety of things, such as: making calls when Cortana is connected to Skype, allowing you to add events to your calendar, apprising you of important messages or important contacts, and keeping you up to date on events or other things that are important to you, like package tracking. Cortana also uses your contacts and messages to help you with planning around your events and offers other helpful suggestions and recommendations.---Communications history. Cortana learns who is most important to you by analyzing your call, text message, and email history. Cortana uses this data to keep track of people most relevant to you and your preferred methods of communication, flag important messages for you (such as missed calls), and improve the performance of Cortana features, such as speech recognition.---Calendar appointments. Cortana uses your calendars to provide reminders and information relevant to your appointments.Browse history. If you choose, Cortana can use your Microsoft Edge browse history associated with your Microsoft account. Cortana uses this data to learn about you and provide you with intelligent answers and timely, personalized suggestions, or to complete web tasks for you. Cortana can also help you pick up where you left off on one device when browsing in Microsoft Edge on another device. Cortana won\u2019t collect information about sites you visit in InPrivate tabs.Connected services and Skills. To enable greater personalization and productivity, you can give Cortana permission to (i) collect data from other Microsoft and third-party services, and (ii) share your information with those services. When you enable data sharing, Cortana shares your requests and responses with those services or third parties to enable your commands. With your permission, Cortana may also share additional information (e.g., your location). Information you share with a third party is governed by the third party\u2019s privacy policy and terms. Cortana also uses data about your use of Connected services and Skills to improve and develop Cortana and other Microsoft products. For example, we use this data, including your query sent to the third party, to improve speech recognition and user-intent understanding within Microsoft products, especially Cortana. Below are examples of how your data is processed when you use Connected services and Skills:\r\n---If you choose to connect Cortana to your work or school account, Cortana can access data stored in Office 365 to help you stay up to date, manage your email and calendar, and get insights about your meetings and relationships. ---Choosing to sign in to LinkedIn within Cortana allows Microsoft to access your LinkedIn data so Cortana can give you more personalized information and recommendations. Please note that Cortana enables LinkedIn to access the name, email address, job title, and company name of people are you are meeting with, so she can retrieve relevant information about those contacts.---Cortana allows you to connect to third-party services to enable her to do more and provide additional personalized experiences based upon data from the third-party service. Not all Skills require your authentication. With your permission, Cortana can also send information about you along with your request to certain third-parties. For instance, when you ask Cortana to request you a ride, Cortana will send Uber your request along with your current location and destination.Microsoft TranslatormainMicrosoftTranslatormoduleSummaryMicrosoft Translator is a machine translation system designed to automatically translate text and speech between numerous supported languages.Microsoft Translator (which includes apps for Android, iOS, Windows, Translator Hub, Translator for Bing, and Translator for Microsoft Edge, collectively \u201cTranslator\u201d) processes the text, image, and speech data you submit, as well as device and usage data. We use this data to provide Translator, personalize your experiences, and improve our products. Microsoft has implemented business and technical measures designed to help de identify the data you submit to Translator. For example, when we randomly sample text to improve Translator, we delete identifiers and certain text, such as email addresses and some number sequences, detected in the sample that could contain personal data.For more information on the Cognitive Services Translator Text API, Custom Translator, and Translator Speech API, see the Enterprise and developer products section of this privacy statement. For the Translate feature in Office, see the Productivity and communications products section of this privacy statement.SwiftKeymainswiftkeymoduleSummary\r\n    SwiftKey Keyboard and related products (collectively, the \u201cSwiftKey Services\u201d) process data about how you type and write, and use this data to learn your writing style and provide personalized autocorrection and predictive text that adapts to you. We also use this data to offer a range of other features, such as hashtag and emoji prediction.\r\n\r\n    SwiftKey prediction technology learns from the way you use language to build a personalized language model. This model is an optimized view of the words and phrases that you use most often in context and reflects your unique writing style. The model itself contains the words you commonly type arranged in a way to enable SwiftKey\u2019s algorithms to make predictions based on what you type. The model draws from all scenarios in which you use your keyboard, including when you type while using apps or visiting websites. The SwiftKey keyboard and model attempts to avoid collecting sensitive data, such as fields flagged as containing password or payment data. SwiftKey Services do not log, store, or learn from data you type, or the data contained in your model, unless you choose to share your data with us (as described further below). When you use SwiftKey Services, we also collect device and usage data. We use de-identified device and usage data to analyze service performance and help improve \r\n    our products.\r\n\r\n    The SwiftKey Services also include an optional cloud component called a SwiftKey Account. If you choose to create a SwiftKey Account, your language model will be synced with the SwiftKey Account cloud service, so you can benefit from that model on the different devices you use and access additional services such as personalization, prediction synchronization, and backup. When you create a SwiftKey Account, Microsoft will also collect your email address and basic demographic data. All data collected is transferred to our servers over encrypted channels.\r\n\r\n    SwiftKey Account holders have the option to use the SwiftKey personalization service, which more quickly establishes and improves personalized predictions by allowing SwiftKey to access content on your device, including content you send through SMS, and certain apps such as Outlook.com, Gmail, Facebook and Twitter when you choose to connect them to the service.\r\n\r\n    You may also opt in to send short snippets of what and how you type for product improvement. To preserve your privacy, SwiftKey Services de-identifies these snippets, so they are not linked to your account. You can withdraw your consent to share these snippets at any time in SwiftKey Settings. You can also withdraw your consent to allow SwiftKey Services to use and retain your personal data at any time in SwiftKey Settings. When you withdraw consent, personal data collected through your use of the SwiftKey Services will be deleted.\r\n\r\n\r\n    You may receive occasional notifications on your device alerting you to product updates and features that may be of interest to you. You can disable these notifications at any time in the SwiftKey Settings.\r\nWindowsmainwindowsmoduleSummaryWindows is a personalized computing environment that enables you to seamlessly roam and access services, preferences, and content across your computing devices from phones to tablets to the Surface Hub. Rather than residing as a static software program on your device, key components of Windows are cloud-based, and both cloud and local elements of Windows are updated regularly, providing you with the latest improvements and features. In order to provide this computing experience, we collect data about you, your device, and the way you use Windows. And because Windows is personal to you, we give you choices about the personal data we collect and how we use it. Note that if your Windows device is managed by your organization (such as your employer or school), your organization may use centralized management tools provided by Microsoft or others to access and process your data and to control device settings (including privacy settings), device policies, software updates, data collection by \r\n    us or the organization, or other aspects of your device. Additionally, your organization may use management tools provided by Microsoft or others to access and process your data from that device, including your interaction data, diagnostic data, and the contents of your communications and files. For \r\n    more information about data collection and privacy in Windows, see Windows 10 and your online services. Earlier versions of Windows (including Windows Vista, Windows 7, Windows 8, and Windows 8.1) are subject to their own privacy statements. ActivationmainactivationmoduleSummaryWhen you activate Windows, a specific product key is associated with the device on which your software is installed. The product key and data about the software and your device is sent to Microsoft to help validate your license to the software. This data may be sent again if there is a need to re-activate or validate your license. On phones running Windows, device and network identifiers, as well as device location at the time of the first power-up of the device, are also sent to Microsoft for the purpose of warranty registration, stock replenishment, and fraud prevention.Activity historymainactivityhistorymoduleSummary\r\n    Activity history helps keep track of the things you do on your device, such as the apps and services you use, the files you open, and the websites you browse. Your activity history is stored locally on your device when using different apps and features such as Microsoft Edge, some Microsoft Store apps, and Office apps. If you've signed in to your device with a Microsoft account and given your permission, Windows sends your activity history to Microsoft. Once your activity history is in the cloud, Microsoft uses that data to enable cross-device experiences, to provide you with the ability to continue those activities on other devices, to provide personalized experiences (such as ordering your activities based on duration of use) and relevant suggestions (such as anticipating what your needs might be based on your activity history), and to help improve Microsoft products.\r\n\r\n    Activity history is also created and sent to Microsoft when you use Microsoft apps, such as Microsoft Edge, and Office apps like Word, Excel, and PowerPoint, on mobile devices such as iOS and Android phones and tablets. If you are signed in with your Microsoft account, you can continue activities on your Windows\u00a010 device that you started in Microsoft apps on your Android or iOS device. You can turn settings off or on for sending your activity history to Microsoft and storing activity history locally on your device, and you can also clear your device\u2019s activity history at any time by going to Start > Settings > Privacy > Activity history. Learn more about activity history in Windows 10.Advertising IDmainadvertisingidmoduleSummary\r\n    Windows generates a unique advertising ID for each person using a device, which app developers and advertising networks can then use to provide more relevant advertising in apps. When the advertising ID is enabled, both Microsoft apps and third-party apps can access and use the advertising ID in much the same way that websites can access and use a unique identifier stored in a cookie. Thus, your advertising ID can be used by app developers and advertising networks to provide more relevant advertising and other personalized experiences across their apps and on the web. Microsoft collects the advertising ID for the uses described here only when you choose to enable the advertising ID as part of your privacy setting. \r\n    The advertising ID setting applies to Windows apps using the Windows advertising identifier to provide interest-based advertising. You can turn off access to this identifier at any time by turning off the advertising ID in Settings. If you choose to turn it on again, the advertising ID will be reset and a new identifier will be generated. When a third-party app accesses the advertising ID, its use of the advertising ID will be subject to its own privacy policy. Learn more about advertising ID in Windows 10.\r\n    The advertising ID setting does not apply to other methods of interest-based advertising delivered by Microsoft or third parties, such as cookies used to provide interest-based display ads on websites. Third-party products accessed through or installed on Windows may also deliver other forms of interest-based advertising subject to their own privacy policies. Microsoft delivers other forms of interest-based ads in certain Microsoft products, both directly and by partnering with third-party ad providers. For more information on how Microsoft uses data for advertising, see the How we use personal data section of this statement. DiagnosticsmaindiagnosticsmoduleSummary\r\n    Microsoft collects Windows diagnostic data to solve problems and to keep Windows up to date, secure, and operating properly. It also helps us improve Windows and related Microsoft products and services and, for customers who have turned on the \u201cTailored experiences\u201d setting, to provide more relevant tips and recommendations to tailor Microsoft and third-party products and services for Windows to the customer\u2019s needs. This data is transmitted to Microsoft and stored with one or more unique identifiers that can help us recognize an individual user on an individual device and understand the device's service issues and use patterns. There are two levels of diagnostic and activity data: Basic and Full. If an organization (such as your employer or school) uses Microsoft management tools or engages Microsoft to manage your device, we and the organization will use and process diagnostic and error data from your device to allow the management, monitoring, and \r\n    troubleshooting of the organization's devices, and for other purposes of the organization.\r\nBasic data includes information about your device, its settings and capabilities, and whether it is performing properly. We collect the following data at the Basic level:---Device, connectivity, and configuration data:\r\n        Data about the device such as the processor type, OEM manufacturer, type of battery and capacity, number and type of cameras, firmware, and memory attributes.Network capabilities and connection data such as the device\u2019s IP address, mobile network (including IMEI and mobile operator), and whether the device is connected to a free or paid network.Data about the operating system and its configuration such as the OS version and build number, region and language settings, diagnostics level, and whether the device is part of the Windows Insider program.Data about connected peripherals such as model, manufacturer, drivers, and compatibility data.Data about the applications installed on the device such as application name, version, and publisher.---Whether a device is ready for an update and whether there are factors that may impede the ability to receive updates, such as low battery, limited disk space, or connectivity through a paid network.---Whether updates complete successfully or fail.---Data about the reliability of the diagnostics collection system itself.---Basic error reporting, which is health data about the operating system and applications running on your device. For example, basic error reporting tells us if an application, such as Microsoft Paint or a third-party game, hangs or crashes. Full data includes everything collected with Basic data, plus additional information about device health, device activity (also sometimes referred to as usage), and enhanced error reporting that helps Microsoft to fix and improve products and services for all users. We collect the following additional information at the Full level:---Additional data about the device, connectivity, and configuration, beyond that collected at Basic.---Status and logging information about the health of operating system and other system components (in addition to data about the update and diagnostics systems collected at Basic).---App activity, such as which programs are launched on a device, how long they run, and how quickly they respond to input.---Browser activity, including browsing history and search terms, in Microsoft browsers (Microsoft Edge or Internet Explorer).---Enhanced error reporting, including the memory state of the device when a system or app crash occurs (which may unintentionally contain user content, such as parts of a file you were using when the problem occurred). Crash data is never used for Tailored experiences as described below.\r\n    Some of the data described above may not be collected from your device even if your Diagnostic data setting is set to Full. Microsoft minimizes the volume of data it collects from all devices by collecting some of the data at the Full level from only a subset of devices (sample). By running the Diagnostic Data Viewer tool, you can see an icon which indicates whether your device is part of a sample and also which specific data is collected from your device. Instructions for how to download the Diagnostic Data Viewer tool can be found at Start > Settings > Privacy > Diagnostics & feedback.\r\n    Specific data items collected in Windows diagnostics are subject to change to give Microsoft flexibility to collect the data needed for the purposes described. For example, to ensure Microsoft can troubleshoot the latest performance issue impacting users\u2019 computing experience or update a Windows 10 device that is new to the market, Microsoft may need to collect data items that were not collected previously. For a current list of data types collected at both levels of diagnostics, see Windows 10 diagnostic data at the Full level or Windows 10 diagnostic data at the Basic level for the current list of data collected at Basic. We provide limited portions of error report information to partners (such as the device manufacturer) to help them troubleshoot products and services which work with Windows and other Microsoft product and services. They are only permitted to use this information to repair or improve those products and services. We may also share some aggregated, de-identified \r\n    diagnostic data, such as general usage trends for Windows apps and features, with selected third parties. Learn more about diagnostic data in Windows 10.Inking and typing Recognition. You also can choose to help Microsoft improve inking and typing recognition by sending inking and typing diagnostic data. If you choose to do so, Microsoft will collect samples of the content you type or write to improve features such as handwriting recognition, autocompletion, next word prediction, and spelling correction in the many languages used by Windows customers. When Microsoft collects inking and typing diagnostic data, it is divided into small samples and processed to remove unique identifiers, sequencing information, and other data (such as email addresses and numeric values) which could be used to reconstruct the original content or associate the input to you. It also includes associated performance data, such as changes you manually make to text, as well as words you've added to the dictionary. Learn more about improving inking and typing in Windows 10.\r\n    If you choose to turn on Tailored experiences, we will use your Windows diagnostic data (Basic or Full as you have selected) to offer you personalized tips, ads, and recommendations to enhance Microsoft products and services for your needs. If you have selected Basic as your diagnostic data setting, personalization is based on information about your device, its settings and capabilities, and whether it is performing properly. If you have selected Full, personalization is also based on information about the websites you browse, how you use apps and features, plus additional information about the health of your device. However, we do not use the content of crash dumps, speech, typing, or inking input data for personalization when we receive such data from customers who have selected Full.\r\n\r\n    Tailored experiences include suggestions on how to customize and optimize Windows, as well as ads and recommendations for Microsoft and third-party products and services, features, apps, and hardware for your Windows experiences. For example, to help you get the most out of your device, we may tell you about features you may not know about or that are new. If you are having a problem with your Windows device, you may be offered a solution. You may be offered a chance to customize your lock screen with pictures, or to be shown more pictures of the kind you like, or fewer of the ones you don\u2019t. If you stream movies in your browser, you may be recommended an app from the Microsoft Store that streams more efficiently. Or, if you are running out of space on your hard drive, Windows may recommend you try OneDrive or purchase hardware to gain more space. Learn more about tailored experiences in Windows 10.Feedback HubmainfeedbackhubmoduleSummary\r\n    Feedback Hub is a preinstalled app that provides a way to gather feedback on Microsoft products and installed first party and third-party apps. You can sign into Feedback Hub using either your personal Microsoft account or an account provided by your organization (such as your employer or school) that you use to sign into Microsoft products. Signing in with your work or school account allows you to submit feedback to Microsoft in association with your organization.\r\n    Any feedback you provide whether using your work or school account or personal Microsoft account is publicly viewable. Additionally, if feedback is provided using your work or school account, your feedback can be viewed through the Feedback Hub by your organization\u2019s IT administrators.\r\n    When you submit feedback to Microsoft about a problem, or upvote a problem, diagnostic data will be sent to Microsoft to improve Microsoft products and services. Depending on your Diagnostic data settings in Start > Settings > Privacy > Diagnostics & feedback, Feedback Hub will either send diagnostic data automatically or you will have the option to send it to Microsoft at the time you provide feedback. Microsoft may also share your feedback and diagnostic data with Microsoft partners (such as a device manufacturer, or firmware developer) to help them troubleshoot products and services that work with Windows and other Microsoft products and services. Learn more about diagnostic data in Windows 10.Location services, motion sensing, and recordingmainlocationservicesmotionsensingmoduleSummaryWindows location service. Microsoft operates a location service that helps determine the precise geographic location of a specific Windows device. Depending on the capabilities of the device, the device\u2019s location can be determined with varying degrees of accuracy and may in some cases be determined precisely. When you have enabled location on a Windows device, or you have given permission for Microsoft apps to access location information on non-Windows devices, data about cell towers and Wi-Fi access points and their locations is collected by Microsoft and added to the location database after removing any data identifying the person or device from which it was collected. This de-identified copy of location information is used to improve Microsoft's location services and, in some instances, shared with our location service provider partners, currently HERE (see https://www.here.com/), to improve the location services of the provider.\r\n    Windows services and features (such as browsers and Cortana), apps running on Windows, and websites opened in Windows browsers can access the device\u2019s location through Windows if you allow them to do so. Some features and apps request location permission when you first install Windows, some ask the first time you use the app, and others ask every time you access the device\u2019s location. For information about certain Windows apps that use the device\u2019s location, see the Windows apps section of this privacy statement. \r\n    When an app or feature accesses the device\u2019s location and you are signed in with a Microsoft account, your Windows device will also upload its location to the cloud where it is available across your devices to other apps or services that use your Microsoft account and for which you\u2019ve granted permission. We will retain only the last known location (each new location replaces the previous one). Data about a Windows device's recent location history is also stored on the device even if not using a Microsoft account, and certain apps and Windows features can access this location history. You can clear your device's location history at any time in the device's Settings menu.\r\n\r\n    In Settings, you can also view which apps have access to the device\u2019s precise location or your device's location history, turn off or on access to the device\u2019s location for particular apps, or turn off access to the device\u2019s location. You can also set a default location, which will be used when the location service can\u2019t detect a more exact location for your device.\r\n    Even when you\u2019ve turned off access to the device\u2019s location, some third-party desktop apps and services could use other technologies (such as Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, cellular modem, etc.) to determine the device\u2019s precise location. \r\nLearn more about third-party desktop apps and how they may still be able to determine your device\u2019s location when the device\u2019s location setting is off.\r\n    In addition, to facilitate getting help in an emergency, whenever you make an emergency call, Windows will attempt to determine and share your precise location, regardless of your location settings. If your device has a SIM card or is otherwise using cellular service, your mobile operator will have access to your device\u2019s location. \r\nLearn more about location in Windows 10.General Location. If you turn on the General Location feature, apps that cannot use your precise location will have access to your general location, such as your city, postal code, or region.Find My Phone. The Find My Phone feature allows you to find the location of your Windows phone from the Microsoft account website, even if you have turned off all access to the location service on the phone. If you have turned on the \"save my location every few hours\" feature in the Find My Phone settings on your phone, the Find My Phone feature will periodically send and store a single last-known location of your phone, even if you have turned off location services on your phone. Each time a new location is sent, it replaces the previously-stored location.\r\nFind my device. The Find my device feature allows an administrator of a Windows portable device to find the location of that device from account.microsoft.com/devices. To enable Find my device, an administrator needs to be signed in with a Microsoft account and have the location setting enabled. This feature will work even if other users have denied access to location for all their apps. When the administrator attempts to locate the device, users will see a notification in the notification area. \r\nLearn more about Find my device in Windows 10.Windows motion sensing. Windows devices with motion activity detection can collect motion activity. This data can enable features such as a pedometer to count the number of steps you take, so a fitness application can estimate how many calories you burn. This data and history is stored on your device and can be accessed by applications you give permission to access and use that data.\r\nRecording. Some Windows devices have a recording feature that allows you to capture audio and video clips of your activity on the device, including your communications with others. If you choose to record a session, the recording will be saved locally on your device. In some cases, you may have the option to transmit the recording to a Microsoft product or service that broadcasts the recording publicly. Important: You should understand your legal responsibilities before recording and/or transmitting any communication. This includes whether you need to get consent from all parties to the communication in advance. Microsoft is not responsible for how you use recording features or your recordings.Security and safety featuresmainsecurityandsafetyfeaturesmoduleSummaryDevice encryption. Device encryption helps protect the data stored on your device by encrypting it using BitLocker Drive Encryption technology. When device encryption is on, Windows automatically encrypts the drive Windows is installed on and generates a recovery key. The BitLocker recovery key for your personal device is automatically backed up online in your personal Microsoft OneDrive account. Microsoft doesn't use your individual recovery keys for any purpose.\r\nMalicious Software Removal Tool. The Malicious Software Removal Tool (MSRT) runs on your device at least once per month as part of Windows Update. MSRT checks devices for infections by specific, prevalent malicious software (\"malware\") and helps remove any infections found. When the MSRT runs, it will remove the malware listed on the Microsoft Support website if the malware is on your device. During a malware check, a report will be sent to Microsoft with specific data about malware detected, errors, and other data about your device. If you do not want MSRT to send this data to Microsoft, you can disable MSRT's reporting component.\r\nMicrosoft Family. Parents can use Microsoft Family to understand and set boundaries on how their child is using their device. There are many features available to Family members, so please carefully review the information provided when you create or join a Family. When Family activity reporting is turned on for a child, Microsoft will collect details about how the child uses their device and provide parents with reports of that child's activities. Activity reports are routinely deleted from Microsoft servers after a short period of time.\r\nWindows Defender SmartScreen. Windows Defender SmartScreen helps protect you when using our services by checking downloaded files and web content for malicious software, potentially unsafe web content, and other threats to you or your device. When checking a file, data about that file is sent to Microsoft, including the file name, a hash of the file's contents, the download location, and the file's digital certificates. If Windows Defender SmartScreen identifies the file as unknown or potentially unsafe, you will see a warning prior to opening the file. When checking web content, data about the content and your device is sent to Microsoft, including the full web address of the content. If Windows Defender SmartScreen detects that content is potentially unsafe, you will see a warning in place of the content. Windows Defender SmartScreen can be turned on or off in Settings.\r\nWindows Defender Antivirus. Windows Defender Antivirus looks for malware and other unwanted software on your device. Windows Defender Antivirus is automatically turned on to help protect your device if no other antimalware software is actively protecting your device. If Windows Defender Antivirus is turned on, it will monitor the security status of your device. When Windows Defender Antivirus is turned on, or is running because Limited Periodic Scanning is enabled, it will automatically send reports to Microsoft that contain data about suspected malware and other unwanted software, and it may also send files that could contain malware. If a report is likely to contain personal data, the report is not sent automatically, and you'll be prompted before it is sent. You can configure Windows Defender Antivirus not to send reports and suspected malware to Microsoft.\r\nSpeech, Inking, and TypingmainspeechinkingtypingmoduleSummaryOnline Speech Recognition. Windows provides both a device-based speech recognition feature (available through the Windows Speech Recognition app) and an online speech recognition service, in regions where Cortana is available. To learn more about what languages and regions speech currently supports, see Cortana\u2019s regions and languages.\r\n\r\n    Turning on the online speech recognition setting lets you use Windows cloud-based speech recognition in Cortana, the Mixed Reality Portal, dictation in Windows from the software keyboard, supported Microsoft Store apps, and over time other parts of Windows. \r\n    When you use the Windows online speech recognition service, Microsoft collects and uses your voice recordings to create a text transcription of the spoken words in the voice data. The voice data is used in the aggregate to help improve our ability to correctly recognize all users\u2019 speech.\r\n\r\n    You can use device-based speech recognition without sending your voice data to Microsoft. However, the Windows cloud-based speech service provides more powerful recognition than the device-based speech recognition. When the online speech recognition setting is turned off, speech services that don\u2019t rely on the cloud and only use device-based recognition, like the Narrator app or the Windows Speech Recognition app, will still work, and Microsoft won\u2019t collect any voice data.\r\n\r\n    If you\u2019ve given permission in Cortana, we also collect your name and nickname, your recent calendar events, and the names of the people in your appointments, information about your contacts including names and nicknames, names of your favorite places, apps you use, and information about your music preferences. This additional data enables us to better recognize people, events, places, and music when you dictate commands, messages, or documents.\r\n    You can turn off online speech recognition at any time. This will stop the data collection for this feature. To control the voice data Microsoft has associated with your Microsoft account, please visit the Microsoft privacy dashboard. When you turn off the online speech recognition setting, any voice data collected while you were not signed in with a Microsoft account will be disassociated from your device. Learn more about the online speech recognition in Windows 10.\r\nInking & Typing Personalization. Your typed and handwritten words are collected to provide you with: a personal dictionary, better character recognition to help you type and write on your device, and text suggestions that appear as you type or write. If you sync your Windows device settings to other Windows devices, your local user dictionary will be stored in your personal OneDrive for the purpose of enabling sharing of your dictionary with your other Windows devices. Learn more about sync settings.\r\n    You can turn off Inking & typing personalization at any time. This will delete data stored on your device, such as your local user dictionary. Learn more about inking & typing personalization in Windows 10.Sync settingsmainsyncsettingsmoduleSummary\r\n    When you sign in to Windows with a Microsoft account, Windows syncs some of your settings and data with Microsoft servers to make it easier to have personalized experiences across multiple devices. After you've signed in to one or more devices with a Microsoft account, when you sign in to another with the same Microsoft account for the first time, Windows will download and apply the settings and data you choose to sync from your other devices. Settings you choose to sync will automatically update on Microsoft servers and your other devices as you use them.\r\n\r\n    Some of the settings that are synced include:---Apps you've installed from the Microsoft Store ---Language preferences ---Ease of Access preferences ---Personalization settings such as your account picture, background, and mouse settings ---Settings for Microsoft Store apps---Spell-checker dictionaries, input method editor (IME) dictionaries, and personal dictionaries ---Internet Explorer browser history, favorites, and websites you have open---Saved app, website, mobile hotspot, and Wi-Fi network names and passwords \r\n    You can choose whether to sync your settings, and control what is synced, by going to Start > Settings > Accounts > Sync your settings. Some apps have their own, separate sync controls. If you sign in to Windows with a work account and you choose to connect that account to your personal Microsoft account, Windows will ask which settings you want to sync before connecting your Microsoft account.\r\nUpdate ServicesmainupdateservicesmoduleSummary\r\n    Update Services for Windows includes Windows Update and Microsoft Update. Windows Update is a service that provides you with software updates for Windows software and other supporting software, such as drivers and firmware supplied by device manufacturers. Microsoft Update is a service that provides you with software updates for other Microsoft software such as\u00a0Office.\r\n\r\n    Windows Update automatically downloads Windows software updates to your device. You can configure Windows Update to automatically install these updates as they become available (recommended) or have Windows notify you when a restart is required to finish installing updates. Apps available through the Microsoft Store are automatically updated through the Microsoft Store, as described in the\u00a0Microsoft Store section of this privacy statement.\r\nWeb browsers\u2014Microsoft Edge and Internet ExplorermainwebbrowsersmoduleSummary\r\n    Microsoft Edge is the default web browser for Windows. Internet Explorer, the legacy browser from Microsoft, is also available in Windows. Whenever you use a web browser to access the internet, data about your device (\"standard device data\") is sent to the websites you visit and online services you use. Standard device data includes your device's IP address, browser type and language, access times, and referring website addresses. This data might be logged on those websites' web servers. Which data is logged and how that data is used depends on the privacy practices of the websites you visit and web services you use. Additionally, Microsoft Edge sends a unique browser ID to certain websites to enable us to develop aggregate data used to improve browser features and services.\r\n    Additionally, data about how you use your browser, such as your browsing history, web form data, temporary internet files, and cookies, is stored on your device. You can delete this data from your device using Delete Browsing History.\r\n\r\n    Microsoft Edge allows you to capture and save content on your device, such as:---Web note. Allows you to create ink and text annotations on the webpages you visit, and clip, save, or share them.---Active reading. Allows you to create and manage reading lists, including websites or documents.---Hub. Allows you to easily manage your reading lists, favorites, downloads, and history all in one area.---Website Pin to Taskbar. which allows you to pin your favorite websites to the Windows taskbar. Websites will be able to see which of their webpages you have pinned, so they can provide you a notification badge letting you know there is something new for you to check out on their websites.\r\n    Some Microsoft browser information saved on your device will be synced across other devices when you sign in with your Microsoft account. For instance, in Internet Explorer, this information includes your browsing history and favorites; and in Microsoft Edge, it includes your favorites, reading lists, autofill form entries (such as your name, address, and phone number), and may include data for extensions that you have installed. As an example, if you sync your Microsoft Edge reading list across devices, copies of the content you choose to save to your reading list will be sent to each synced device for later viewing. You can disable syncing in Internet Explorer by going to Start > Settings > Accounts > Sync your settings. (For more information, see the Sync settings section of this privacy statement.) You can also disable syncing of Microsoft Edge browser information by turning off the sync option in Microsoft Edge Settings.\r\n\r\n    Microsoft Edge and Internet Explorer use your search queries and browsing history to provide you with faster browsing and more relevant search results. These features include:---Search suggestions in Internet Explorer automatically sends the information you type into the browser address bar to your default search provider (such as Bing) to offer search recommendations as you type each character. ---Search and site suggestions in Microsoft Edge automatically sends the information you type into the browser address bar to Bing (even if you have selected another default search provider) to offer search recommendations as you type each character.\r\n    You can turn off these features at any time. In order to provide search results, Microsoft Edge and Internet Explorer send your search queries, standard device information, and location (if you have location enabled) to your default search provider. If Bing is your default search provider, we use this data as described in the Bing section of this privacy statement.\r\n\r\n    Cortana can assist you with your web browsing in Microsoft Edge with features such as Ask Cortana. You can disable Cortana assistance in Microsoft Edge at any time in Microsoft Edge Settings.

Some of those apps include:\r\nMaps app. The Maps app provides location-based services and uses Bing services to process your searches within the Maps app. When the Maps app has access to your location, and you have enabled location-based services in Windows, when you use the \u201c@\u201d key to initiate a search in supported text boxes in Windows apps, Bing services collects the text you type after the \u201c@\u201d key to provide location-based suggestions. To learn more about these Bing-powered experiences, see the Bing section of this privacy statement. When the Maps app has access to your location, even when the app is not in use, Microsoft may collect de-identified location data from your device to improve Microsoft services. You can disable the Maps app's access to your location by turning off the location service or turning off the Maps app's access to the location service.\r\n\r\n    You can keep track of your favorite places and recent map searches in the Maps app. Your favorite places and search history will be included as search suggestions. If you're signed in with your Microsoft account, your favorite places, search history, and certain app settings will be synced across other devices and services (for example, Cortana). For more information, see the Sync settings section of this privacy statement.\r\nCamera and Photo apps. If you allow the Camera app to use your location, location data is embedded in the photos you take with your device. Other descriptive data, such as camera model and the date that the picture was taken, is also embedded in photos and videos. If you choose to share a photo or video, any embedded data will be accessible to the people and services you share with. You can disable the Camera app's access to your location by turning off all access to the location service in your device's Settings menu or turning off the Camera app's access to the location service.\r\n\r\n    Your photos, videos, and screenshots that are saved in your camera roll automatically upload to OneDrive. You can manage your photos and videos in OneDrive, and you can disable the automatic upload in Settings.\r\n\r\n    When you take photos embedded with your location, the Photos app can group your photos by time and location. To group your photos, the Photos app sends location data in your photos to Microsoft to determine the names of locations, such as \"Seattle, Washington.\" When you are using the Photo app while signed in to your Microsoft account, your photos and videos from OneDrive will be automatically sorted into albums in the Photo app and will also appear on the Photo app's live tile. Your photos and/or videos will only be shared with others if you choose to do so.\r\nPeople app. The People app lets you see and interact with all your contacts in one place. When you add an account to the People app, your contacts from your account will be automatically added to the People app. You can add other accounts to the People app, including your social networks (such as Facebook and Twitter) and email accounts. When you add an account, we tell you what data the People app can import or sync with the particular service and let you choose what you want to add. Other apps you install may also sync data to the People app, including providing additional details to existing contacts. When you view a contact in the People app, information about your recent interactions with the contact (such as emails and calendar events, including from apps that the People app syncs data from) will be retrieved and displayed to you. You can remove an account from the People app at any time.Mail and Calendar app. The Mail and Calendar app allows you to connect all your email, calendars, and files in one place, including those from third-party email and file storage providers. The app provides location-based services, such as weather information in your calendar, but you can disable the app\u2019s use of your location. When you add an account to the Mail and Calendar app, your email, calendar items, files, contacts, and other settings from your account will automatically sync to your device and to Microsoft servers. At any time, you can remove an account or make changes to the data that\u2019s synced from your account. To configure an account, you must provide the app with the account credentials (such as user name and password), which will be sent over the internet to the third-party provider\u2019s server. The app will first attempt to use a secure (SSL) connection to configure your account but will send this information unencrypted if your email provider does not support SSL. If you add an account provided by an organization (such as a company email address), the owner of the organizational domain can implement certain policies and controls (for example, multi-factor authentication or the ability to remotely wipe data from your device) that may affect your use of the app.\r\nMessaging app. When you sign in with a Microsoft account on your device, you can choose to back up your information, which will sync your SMS and MMS messages and store them in your Microsoft account. This allows you to retrieve the messages if you lose or change phones. After your initial device set-up, you can manage your messaging settings at any time. Turning off your SMS/MMS backup will not delete messages that have been previously backed up to your Microsoft account. To delete such messages, you must first delete them from your device prior to turning off backup. If you allow the Messaging app to use your location, you can attach a link to your current location to an outgoing message. Location information will be collected by Microsoft as described in the Windows Location services section of this privacy statement.\r\nWindows Media PlayermainwindowsmediaplayermoduleSummaryWindows Media Player allows you to play CDs, DVDs, and other digital content (such as WMA and MP3 files), rip CDs, and manage your media library. To enrich your experience when you play content in your library, Windows Media player displays related media information, such as album title, song titles, album art, artist, and composer. To augment your media information, Windows Media player will send a request to Microsoft which contains standard computer information, an identifier for the media content, and the media information already contained in your Windows Media Player library (including information you may have edited or entered yourself) so that Microsoft can recognize the track and then return additional information that is available.Windows Media Player also allows you to play back content that is streamed to you over a network. To provide this service, it is necessary for Windows Media Player to communicate with a streaming media server. These servers are typically operated by non-Microsoft content providers.

Microsoft Movies & TV allows you to play your video collection and rent or buy movies and TV episodes. These services were formerly offered as Xbox Music and Video.To help you discover content that may interest you, Microsoft will collect data about what content you play, the length of play, and the rating you give it. If you sign in to Cortana on your device, Microsoft will collect and use data related to the music you play via Groove Music to provide personalized experiences and relevant suggestions.To enrich your experience when playing content, Groove Music and Movies & TV will display related information about the content you play and the content in your music and video libraries, such as the album title, cover art, song or video title, and other information, where available. To provide this information, Groove Music and Movies & TV send an information request to Microsoft containing standard device data, such as your device IP address, device software version, your regional and language settings, and an identifier for the content.If you use Movies & TV to access content that has been protected with Microsoft Digital Rights Management (DRM), it may automatically request media usage rights from an online rights server and download and install DRM updates in order to let you play the content. See the DRM information in the Silverlight section of this privacy statement for more information.SilverlightmainsilverlightmoduleSummaryMicrosoft Silverlight helps you to access and enjoy rich content on the Web. Silverlight enables websites and services to store data on your device. Other Silverlight features involve connecting to Microsoft to obtain updates, or to Microsoft or third-party servers to play protected digital content.Silverlight Configuration tool. You can make choices about these features in the Silverlight Configuration tool. To access the Silverlight Configuration tool, right click on content that is currently being displayed by Silverlight and select Silverlight. You can also run the Silverlight Configuration tool directly. In Windows, for example, you can access the tool by searching for \"Microsoft Silverlight.\"Silverlight application storage. Silverlight-based applications can store data files locally on your computer for a variety of purposes, including saving your custom settings, storing large files for graphically intensive features (such as games, maps, and images), and storing content that you create within certain applications. You can turn off or configure application storage in the Silverlight Configuration tool.Silverlight updates. Silverlight will periodically check a Microsoft server for updates to provide you with the latest features and improvements. A small file containing information about the latest Silverlight version will be downloaded to your computer and compared to your currently installed version. If a newer version is available, it will be downloaded and installed on your computer. You can turn off or configure updates in the Silverlight Configuration tool.Digital Rights Management. Silverlight uses Microsoft Digital Rights Management (DRM) technology to help protect the rights of content owners. If you access DRM-protected content (such as music or video) with Silverlight, it will request media usage rights from a rights server on the Internet. In order to provide a seamless playback experience, you will not be prompted before Silverlight sends the request to the rights server. When requesting media usage rights, Silverlight will provide the rights server with an ID for the DRM-protected content file and basic data about your device, including data about the DRM components on your device such as their revision and security levels, and a unique identifier for your device.DRM updates. In some cases, accessing DRM-protected content will require an update to Silverlight or to the DRM components on your device. When you attempt to play content that requires a DRM update, Silverlight will send a request to a Microsoft server containing basic data about your device, including information about the DRM components on your computer such as their revision and security levels, troubleshooting data, and a unique identifier for your device. The Microsoft server uses this identifier to return a unique DRM update for your device, which will then be installed by Silverlight. You can turn off or configure DRM component updates on the Playback tab in the Silverlight Configuration tool.Microsoft Health servicesmainmicrosofthealthservicesmoduleSummary\r\n    Microsoft Health services can help you understand and manage your health data. They include HealthVault, HealthVault Insights, Microsoft Band devices, other Microsoft Health applications and related products. The Band helps you keep track of data like heart rate and steps taken. The Band can also use Cortana to take notes and receive notifications from your phone. The Microsoft Health applications send data to Microsoft servers and allow you to view, manage and control the data. The applications may enable notifications to the Band and other devices. HealthVault services let you gather, edit, add to, and store health data online, and share your health data with family, caregivers, and health care professionals.\r\n\r\n    Microsoft Health services collect and use your data to provide the services, which includes improving and personalizing your experiences. Health data you provide to Microsoft through Microsoft Health services is not combined with data from other Microsoft services, or used for other purposes without your explicit consent. For example, Microsoft does not use your health record data to market or advertise to you without your opt-in consent.\r\nHealth servicesmainmicrosoftservicelongmoduleSummary\r\n    Microsoft Health services can help you understand and manage your health data. The data collected depends on the services and features you use, and includes the following:\r\n---Profile data. When you create a profile, you provide data, such as height, weight, and age that is used to calculate your activity results. Other profile data comes from your personal Microsoft account.\r\n    ---Activity and fitness data. Microsoft Health services help you keep track of your activity and fitness by collecting data like your heart rate, steps, calories burned, and sleep. Examples of types of activities you can choose to track are runs, workouts, and sleep.\r\n    ---Usage data. To provide you with the best service, we collect and automatically upload statistics about the performance and your use of the Microsoft Health services.\r\n    ---Location. Microsoft Band has built-in Global Positioning System (GPS) capabilities, which let you map your activities like running or biking, without having to carry your phone with you. If you enable GPS for an activity, you can view the activity map in the Microsoft Health applications. Some modes on the Band, such as Golf and Explorer, automatically turn on GPS, and turn it off when you end the mode.\u00a0\r\n    To learn more about the Band's sensors and the data they collect, see the Microsoft Band page on the Microsoft Support website.Access and control. You can view and manage your data in Microsoft Health services. For example, you can view and update your profile data, manage connected applications, and view past activities. You can delete specific activity details in the Microsoft Health services. When you delete a specific activity, the event is deleted from the Microsoft Health services; however, other data and the basic sensor data captured by the devices remain in the Microsoft Health services. You can cancel your Microsoft Health services account at any time by contacting Customer Support from the Microsoft Band website.\r\nCortana. The Microsoft Health services allow you to use Cortana. When you use Cortana, data you process in the Microsoft Health services, including health-related data and data processed from third-party services, is shared with Cortana. Cortana\u2019s capabilities allow you to perform queries and set reminders with your voice, if Cortana is enabled on your device. To learn more about how Cortana manages your data, see the Cortana section of this privacy statement.\r\nHealthVaultmainhealthvaultmoduleSummary\r\n    HealthVault is a personal health platform that lets you gather, edit, store, and share health data online. With HealthVault, you can control your own health records. You can also choose to share your health data with family, caregivers, health care professionals, mobile applications, health-related devices, and online tools. For more information about HealthVault, visit the HealthVault Help page.\r\nSigning in to HealthVault. To sign in to HealthVault, you can use Microsoft account or third-party authentication services. If you close your Microsoft account or lose your account credentials, you may not be able to access your data. You can use more than one credential with HealthVault to help ensure continued access. Before using a third-party authentication service with HealthVault, we recommend you review the security and privacy commitments offered by the issuer.\r\nHealthVault account and Health records. To create a new HealthVault account, you must provide personal data such as name, date of birth, e-mail address, postal code, and country/region. Depending on which features you use, you may be asked for additional information. A HealthVault account allows you to manage one or more health records, such as the ones you create for yourself and your family members. You can add or remove data to a health record you manage at any time.\r\n\r\n    In the U.S., HealthVault assigns each health record a unique HealthVault email address. When a message is received at that email address, the message and attachments are automatically added to the HealthVault record, and a notification email is sent to the custodians of that record. The email service in HealthVault uses \"Direct,\" a protocol designed specifically to communicate with health care providers. For that reason, HealthVault email can only be sent and received with providers that use a system that uses the Direct protocol. Custodians can add or disable record email addresses.\r\nSharing health data. A key value of HealthVault is the ability you have to share your health data with people and services that can help you meet your health-related goals. By default, you are the custodian of any records you create. Custodians have the highest level of access to a health record. As a custodian, you can share data in a health record with another person by sending an e-mail invitation through HealthVault. You can specify what type of access they have (including custodian access), how long they have access, and whether they can modify the data in the record. When you grant someone access, that person can grant the same level of access to someone else (for example, someone with view-only access can grant another user view-only access). Because inappropriate granting of access could allow someone to violate your privacy or even revoke your access to your own records, you should be cautious about granting access to your records.\r\n    You can choose to share specific data (or all of the data) in a health record with other services, including participating third-party services you authorize. No service has access to your data through HealthVault unless an authorized user grants it access through HealthVault. HealthVault allows you to control access by accepting or denying requests. For each service granted access, you choose what health information in a specific health record to share and what actions each service may perform on the health information.\r\n\r\n    A service you authorize for a record will get the full name associated with your HealthVault account, the nickname of the authorized record(s), and your relationship to that record. The service will continue to have access through HealthVault until you revoke the permission. Microsoft can revoke a service's access to HealthVault if it does not meet its privacy commitments to Microsoft. However, except for applying the access permissions you have granted to third-party services, we do not control or monitor third-party services, and their privacy practices will vary.\r\nReports to U.S. health care providers. In the United States, we enable participating health care providers to obtain reports about whether the information they send to a record in Microsoft Health services is used. This feature supports the \"meaningful use\" objective of the HITECH Act, which provides incentives for health care providers to send their patients copies of their medical information electronically. Providers that participate can get reports that include a number the provider uses to identify the patient within its system, and whether the user took one of the \"qualifying actions\" in HealthVault (but no information about which action). \"Qualifying action\" currently includes activities such as viewing, downloading, or transmitting health information via email. You can turn off reporting for your records.\r\nAccess and controls. You can review, edit, or delete your HealthVault account data, or close your HealthVault account at any time. Only custodians can permanently delete an item. When you delete a heath record, it is deleted from all users who had access to it.\r\n\r\n    When you close your HealthVault account, we delete all records for which you are the sole custodian. If you share custodian access for a record, you can decide whether to delete the record. Microsoft will wait a limited amount of time before permanently deleting your data in order to help avoid accidental or malicious removal of your health data.\r\n\r\n    HealthVault maintains a full history of each access, change or deletion by users and services, which includes the date, action, and name of the person or service. Custodians of records can examine the history of those records.\r\nEmail communications. We will use the email address you provide when you create your HealthVault account to send you an email requesting that you validate your email address, to include in sharing invitations you send through HealthVault, and to send you service notifications, such as email notifications that information is available to add to your HealthVault records.\r\n\r\n    HealthVault periodically sends newsletters to help keep you informed of the latest improvements. HealthVault will also periodically send you an email summarizing recent account activity. Subject to your contact preferences, we also use your email addresses to send you promotional email. You can unsubscribe from these emails at any time.\r\n\r\n                                maineuropeanprivacymodule,mainsecurityofpersonaldatamodule,mainwherewestoreandprocessdatamodule,mainourretentionofpersonaldatamodule,mainadvertisingmodule,maincollectionofdatafromchildrenmodule,mainpreviewreleasesmodule,mainchangestothisprivacystatementmodule,mainhowtocontactusmodule\r\n                            \r\n                                mainenterpriseservicesmodule,mainenterprisedevsoftwareappsmodule\r\n                            \r\n                                mainofficeservicesmodule,mainonedrivemodule,mainoutlookmodule,mainskypemodule,mainlinkedinmodule\r\n                            \r\n                                mainbingmodule,maincortanamodule,mainMicrosoftTranslatormodule,mainswiftkeymodule\r\n                            \r\n                                mainactivationmodule,mainactivityhistorymodule,mainadvertisingidmodule,maindiagnosticsmodule,mainfeedbackhubmodule,mainlocationservicesmotionsensingmodule,mainsecurityandsafetyfeaturesmodule, mainspeechinkingtypingmodule, mainsyncsettingsmodule,mainupdateservicesmodule,mainwebbrowsersmodule,mainwi-fisensemodule,mainwindowsappsmodule,mainwindowsmediaplayermodule,mainwindowshellomodule,mainwindowssearchmodule\r\n                            \r\n                                mainxboxmodule,mainwindowsstoremodule,mainmainmodule,mainmixermodule,maingroovemusicmoviestvmodule,mainsilverlightmodule\r\n                            \r\n                                mainmicrosoftservicelongmodule,mainhealthvaultmodule\r\n                            mainenterprisedeveloperproductsmoduleCookies\r\n    Most Microsoft sites use cookies, small text files placed on your device which web servers in the domain that placed the cookie can retrieve later.

You may choose to have the arbitration conducted by telephone, based on written submissions, or in person in the county where you live or at another mutually agreed location. The decision of the arbitrator shall be final and not appealable, and judgment on the arbitration award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof.

You hereby authorize and permit us to use and store your Bill Payment Account Information to accomplish the foregoing and to configure the Bill Payment Services so that they are compatible with the Third Party Sites for which you submit your Bill Payment Account Information. In some cases, we may display bills to you from your service providers who are also customers of Intuit\u2019s other products or services. You may decline use of Bill Payment Services for all billers at any time. You must adhere to our Acceptable Use Policy when using the Bill Payment Services. Such policy is provided on the Sites. We reserve the right not process transactions that violate our Acceptable Use Policy.\n---Description of Fees There may be charges for certain transactions and services when you elect to use the Bill Payment Services.

You represent and warrant that you have the right to authorize Mint Bills to charge the Funding Account for payments you initiate using the Bill Payment Services. You will indemnify and hold Intuit harmless from any claims by any third party, including any other owner of the account related to Intuit\u2019s access to the Funding Account.\nYou are responsible for confirming the accuracy of the information you provide about each payment you send, including the email/physical address or telephone number of the recipient (the \"Payee\"), and the amount of the transaction.\nYou represent and warrant that Mint Bills may send communication to the Payee on your behalf in connection with the Bill Payment Services. By using the Bill Pay Services, you represent and warrant that you and each person you identify have consented to receive ongoing communication, including text messages from us.

For example, you may not be permitted to use a credit card to make a mortgage payment. Additionally, Mint Bills may, at its discretion, impose limits on the number and amount of payments, in aggregate, that you can send using the Bill Payment Services.\nMint Bills may refuse to permit payment to any Payee if we reasonably believe such refusal is necessary or advisable for legal or security reasons. If you fail to maintain a balance in the applicable Funding Account that is insufficient to fund any payment that you initiate, Mint Bills may refuse to make any subsequent payment for as long as we determine to be necessary or appropriate. Mint Bills also reserves the right to refuse to make any other payment.\nMint Bills reserves the right to select the method in which to remit funds on your behalf, and the method to return funds to you in the event your Funding Account is closed or otherwise unavailable to us. The payment methods through the Bill Payment Services may include, but are not limited to, electronic or paper check payments, your designated credit card, or payment via other form of funds transfer that Mint Bills may choose to employ.

These reasons can include, but are not limited to: the Payee\u2019s forwarding address has expired; the Payee\u2019s account number is not valid; the Payee is unable to locate the account; or your account with the Payee is paid in full. You agree that you will not hold Mint Bills liable for any damages resulting from a Payee not receiving payment made through the Bill Payment Services for any reason.\nWe use reasonable efforts to research and correct the returned payment and deliver it to your Payee. Payments outstanding after a reasonable time based on the method of payment may be automatically voided by Mint Bills and the payment amount credited to your Funding Account. You are responsible for reconciling your Account(s) and reviewing the status of the payments. If we are unable to complete a payment for any reason, we may, in a method of our choosing and at our sole discretion, provide you with notice. We will to the extent permitted by law, make reasonable attempts to return any unclaimed, refused, refunded, prohibited or denied payments to your Funding Account or use other reasonable efforts to return such payment to you as permitted by law.\n---\nInability to Access Funds from Funding Account In using the Bill Payment Services, you are requesting Mint Bills to facilitate making payments from your Funding Account(s) to your Payee(s). If Bill Payment Service is unable to access funds from your specified Funding Account to complete a bill payment transaction you request for any reason (for example, non-sufficient funds, closed account, inability to locate account, or reversal by you and/or your bank), the transaction may not be completed. If Bill Payment Service is unable to access funds from your specified Funding Account for any reason, you agree that:\nyou will reimburse Mint Bills immediately, upon demand, the transaction amount to the extent that Mint Bills sent a payment to the Payee on your behalf;\nyou will reimburse Mint Bills for any fees imposed on us as a result of the transaction;\nduring the telephone call you make when you initiate payment for the Bill Payment Service you agree that Mint Bills can rely on your verbal authorization for the payment method you select;\nyou agree to give Mint Bills permission to record the call should any dispute arise regarding the Mint Bills Service; and\nyou will reimburse the Bill Payment Services for any fees, including reasonable attorney fees, we incur in attempting to collect the amount of the transaction from you.\nAdditionally, you agree that Mint Bills may: (a) reverse any corresponding credit or direct deposits issued to you; (b) reverse any payments Mint Bills made to your Payee; (c) apply any money currently held by Mint Bills to any amount owed to us; (d) initiate electronic fund transfer from your account to collect any unpaid amounts and our fees.\nMint Bills is not responsible for any overdraft fees, over-the-limit fees, or insufficient fund charges (including finance charges, late fees, or similar charges) that result from your failure to maintain a balance or available credit in the Funding Account that is sufficient to fund all payments you initiate.\nIf Mint Bills is not able to recover all amounts owed to us, we may report this information to third parties, including consumer reporting agencies, financial institutions. Mint Bills reserves all rights to pursue all available legal remedies to recover all owed amounts.\nAny fees applicable to your use of the Bill Payment Services will be charged regardless of whether or not or how often you use the Bill Payment Services during each period for which you have subscribed to the applicable Service. There may be charges for additional transactions and other optional services that you elect to use. You agree to pay fees for the all Bill Payment Services you use or subscribe to as described on the Sites.\n---\nYour Liability You are solely liable for errors you make in using the Bill Payment Services, including the following:\nyou direct Mint Bills to submit a payment to a Payee from the wrong Funding Account;\nyou erroneously direct Mint Bills to submit a payment to a Payee multiple times;\nyou direct Mint Bills to submit the wrong amount to a Payee;\nyou direct Mint Bills to submit a payment to the wrong Payee; or\nyou change your mind about making a payment to a Payee after directing Mint Bills to submit the payment.\nYou are responsible for all fees, fines, penalties, and other liability incurred by Mint Bills, a Payee, you or a third party caused by or arising out of your breach of this Agreement and/or your use of the Bill Payment Services. You agree to reimburse Mint Bills, a Payee or the applicable third party for any and all such liability.\nIn the event that you are liable for any amounts owed to Mint Bills for a payment you authorized through the Bill Payment Services, Mint Bills may immediately remove such amounts from or charge such amounts to your applicable Funding Account. If the applicable Funding Account does not have funds or available credit sufficient to cover your liability, you will be required to immediately add funds to the Funding Account or otherwise provide payment to Mint Bills through other means. If you do not do so, Mint Bills may engage in collection efforts to recover such amounts from you.\nMint Bills does not have control of, or liability for, the products or services that are paid for via the Bill Payment Services.\n---As permitted, you may cancel, edit, or stop a payment prior to the pay date by following the directions within the help section of the Bill Payment Service. Our ability to stop a payment request will depend on the manner in which the payment was initiated, the method of payment, and whether or not the Payee has begun processing payment. Although we will make a reasonable effort to accommodate a stop payment request, we will have no liability for failing to do so unless there is an exception provided elsewhere in this Agreement. We may also require you to present your stop payment request in writing after contacting customer care. The charge for each stop payment will be the current charge for such stop payment and fund recovery service as set out in any applicable fee schedule or as disclosed through the site.\n---\nDelays, Unauthorized Transactions, or Errors\nPayment Processing Delays and Protection for Late Fees. You acknowledge that some transactions may take longer to be credited to your account with the applicable Payee due to circumstances beyond Mint Bills' control, such as delays in handling and posting payments by Payees or financial institutions or errors with account information or funding instructions.\nWhen you send a payment to certain Payees, the payment may be treated as an authorization to the Payee to process your payment and complete the transaction. Some Payees may delay processing your payment, in which case the payment may be held as pending until the Payee processes your payment and your payment authorization will remain valid for up to 30 days.\nTo help ensure that there is enough time for the applicable Payee to receive any payments you submit through the Bill Payment Services, you should submit payment instructions at least 6 business days prior to the due date for the applicable bill for most electronic payments. Please add additional business days if we issue a paper check to the Payee on your behalf. If the due date falls on a weekend or holiday, you must submit the payment sufficiently in advance to include an additional day for processing. It is solely your responsibility to submit payments so they arrive by the Payee's due date.\nSubject to the other provisions of this Agreement, Mint Bills will bear responsibility for any satisfactorily documented late payment related charges up to a reasonable amount, not to exceed $50.00 in the event a payment posts after its due date provided that the payment was submitted by you for payment in accordance with the guidelines specified in the beginning of this paragraph and the Bill Payment Services issued you a confirmation number for a payment, unless we are not responsible to you for one of the reasons listed in this section or below under \"Protection for Mint Bills Errors.\" THIS IS MINT BILLS ONLY OBLIGATION TO YOU FOR ANY PAYMENT ERRORS, DELAYS, OR FAILURE. IF YOU DO NOT FOLLOW THESE RULES OR IF YOU DO NOT ALLOW ENOUGH TIME TO COMPLETE A PAYMENT, YOU ALONE ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY PENALTIES OR LATE CHARGES ON THAT PAYMENT.\nAny fees applicable to your use of a Service will be charged regardless of whether or how often you use the Services during each period for which you have subscribed to the applicable Service. There may be charges for additional transactions and other optional services that you elect to use. You agree to pay fees for the all Services you use or subscribe to as described on the Sites.\nErrors or other Issues Regarding Payments.

The transactions will appear only on the statement issued by your bank or other financial institution.

We will attempt to rectify processing errors we discover. If we determine we have paid you less than you were entitled to receive, we will send you an appropriate amount. If an error has resulted in your receiving more than you were entitled to, you agree to promptly refund the excess. You agree that we may set off any amount you owe us from future payments due to you. Failure to properly notify us within 60 days of an error first appearing in a payment confirmation we have made available to you will be deemed a waiver of any rights you may have regarding such error.\nBack to Top\n\u00a0\n27.

If you sell or return a computer or Netflix ready device, you should log out and deactivate the device before doing so. If you do not maintain the security of your password or device, or fail to log out or deactivate your device, subsequent users may be able to access your account, including your personal information.\nIf you share or otherwise allow others to have access to your account, they will be able to see your information (including in some cases personal information) such as your watch history, ratings, reviews and account information (including your email address or other information in the \"Account\" area of our website). This remains true even if you use our profiles feature.\nProfiles allow users to have a distinct, personalized Netflix experience, built around the movies and shows of interest to them, as well as separate watch histories. Please note that profiles are available to everyone who uses your Netflix account, so that anyone with access to your Netflix account can navigate to and use, edit or delete profiles.

You can choose to receive mobile push notifications from Netflix. If you subsequently decide you no longer wish to receive these notifications, you can use your mobile device's settings functionality to turn them off.\nInterest-Based Ads. Interest-based ads are online ads that are tailored to your likely interests based on your use of various apps and websites across the Internet. If you are using a browser, then cookies and web beacons can be used to collect information to help determine your likely interests. If you are using a mobile device, tablet, or streaming media device that includes an advertising identifier, then that identifier can be used to help determine your likely interests. For your choices about interest-based ads from Netflix, please see the \"Cookies and Internet Advertising\" section (below).\nYou can request access to your personal information, or correct or update out-of-date or inaccurate personal information we hold about you.\nYou can most easily do this by visiting the \"Account\" portion of our website, where you have the ability to access and update a broad range of information about your account, including your contact information, your Netflix payment information, and various related information about your account (such as the content you have viewed and rated, and your reviews). You must be signed in to access the \"Account\" section. You may also request that we delete personal information that we hold about you.\nTo make requests, or if you have any other question regarding our privacy practices, please contact our Data Protection Officer/Privacy Office at privacy@netflix.com. We respond to all requests we receive from individuals wishing to exercise their data protection rights in accordance with applicable data protection laws. Please also see the \"Your Choices\" section of this Privacy Statement for additional choices regarding your information.\nWe may reject requests that are unreasonable or not required by law, including those that would be extremely impractical, could require disproportionate technical effort, or could expose us to operational risks such as free trial fraud. We may retain information as required or permitted by applicable laws and regulations, including to honor your choices, for our billing or records purposes and to fulfill the purposes described in this Privacy Statement. We take reasonable measures to destroy or de-identify personal information in a secure manner when it is no longer required.\nWe use reasonable administrative, logical, physical and managerial measures to safeguard your personal information against loss, theft and unauthorized access, use and modification. These measures are designed to provide a level of security appropriate to the risks of processing your personal information. Unfortunately, no measures can be guaranteed to provide 100% security. Accordingly, we cannot guarantee the security of your personal information.\nThe Netflix service may be provided through and/or utilize features (such as voice controls) operated by third party platforms, or contain links to sites operated by third parties whose policies regarding the handling of information may differ from ours. For example, you may be able to access the Netflix service through platforms such as gaming systems, smart TVs, mobile devices, set top boxes and a number of other Internet connected devices. These websites and platforms have separate and independent privacy or data policies, privacy statements, notices and terms of use, which we recommend you read carefully. In addition, you may encounter third party applications that interact with the Netflix service.\nYou must be 18 years of age or older to subscribe to the Netflix service. In certain jurisdictions, the age of majority may be older than 18, in which case, you must satisfy that age in order to become a member. While individuals under the age of 18 may utilize the service, they may do so only with the involvement, supervision, and approval of a parent or legal guardian.\nWe will update this Privacy Statement from time to time in response to changing legal, regulatory or operational requirements. We will provide notice of any such changes (including when they will take effect) in accordance with law. Your continued use of the Netflix service after any such updates take effect will constitute acknowledgement and (as applicable) acceptance of those changes. If you do not wish to acknowledge or accept any updates to this Privacy Statement, you may cancel your use of the Netflix service. To see when this Privacy Statement was last updated, please see the \"Last Updated\" section below.\nWe and our Service Providers use cookies and other technologies (such as web beacons), as well as advertising identifiers, for various reasons. For example, we use these technologies to make it easy to access our services by remembering you when you return, to provide and analyze our services. We also use cookies, as well as advertising identifiers, to learn more about our users and their likely interests, and to deliver and tailor marketing or advertising. We want you to be informed about our use of these technologies, so this section explains the types of technologies we use, what they do and your choices regarding their use.\n---What are cookies?\nCookies are small data files that are commonly stored on your device when you browse and use websites and online services. They are widely used to make websites work, or to work more efficiently, as well as to provide reporting information and assist with service or advertising personalization.\nCookies are not the only types of technology that enable this functionality; we also use other, similar types of technologies. See below for more information and examples.\n---What are advertising identifiers?\nAdvertising identifiers are similar to cookies and are found on many mobile devices and tablets (for example, the \"Identifier for Advertisers\" (or IDFA) on Apple iOS devices and the \"Google Advertising ID\" on Android devices), and certain streaming media devices. Like cookies, advertising identifiers are used to make online advertising more relevant.\n---Why does Netflix use cookies and advertising identifiers?\nEssential cookies: These cookies are strictly necessary to provide our website or online service. For example, we and our Service Providers may use these cookies to authenticate and identify our members when they use our websites and applications so we can provide our service to them. They also help us to enforce our Terms of Use, prevent fraud and maintain the security of our service.\nPerformance and functionality cookies: These cookies are not essential, but help us to personalize and enhance your online experience with Netflix. For example, they help us to remember your preferences and prevent you from needing to re-enter information you previously provided (for example, during member sign up). We also use these cookies to collect information (such as popular pages, conversion rates, viewing patterns, click-through and other information) about our visitors' use of the Netflix service so that we can enhance and personalize our website and service and conduct market research. Deletion of these types of cookies may result in limited functionality of our service.\nAdvertising cookies and advertising identifiers: These cookies and advertising identifiers use information about your use of this and other websites and apps, your response to ads and emails, and to deliver ads that are more relevant to you. These types of ads are called \"interest-based advertising.\" Many of the advertising cookies associated with our service belong to our Service Providers.\n---How can I exercise choice regarding cookies and advertising identifiers?\nFor more information about cookies set through our website, as well as other types of online tracking (including the collection of information by third parties about your online activities over time and across third-party Web sites or online services for online interest based advertising), and to exercise choices regarding them, click here.\nTo opt out of interest-based ads from Netflix in connection with an advertising identifier on a mobile device, tablet, or streaming media devices, please configure the appropriate setting on your device (usually found under \"privacy\" or \"ads\" in your device's settings). You may still see Netflix ads on your device, but they will not be tailored to your likely interests.\nNetflix supports the following self-regulatory programs, which provide additional privacy choices for interest-based advertising:\nIn the US: Digital Advertising Alliance (DAA)\nIn Europe: European Interactive Digital Advertising Alliance (EDAA)\nIn Canada: Ad Choices: Digital Advertising Alliance of Canada (DAAC) / Choix de Pub: l'Alliance de la publicit\u00e9 num\u00e9rique du Canada (DAAC)\nAt this time, we do not respond to Web browser \"do not track\" signals.\n---How Does Netflix use Web Beacons and other Technologies?\nWeb beacons (also known as clear gifs or pixel tags) often work in conjunction with cookies. We and our Service Providers may use them for similar purposes as cookies, such as to understand and enhance the use of our service, improve site performance, monitor visitor traffic and actions on our site, and understand interactions with our marketing (including email and online ads on third party sites). Because web beacons often work in conjunction with cookies, in many cases, declining cookies will impair the effectiveness of web beacons associated with those cookies.\nWe use other technologies that are similar to cookies, such as browser storage and plugins (e.g., HTML5, IndexedDB, and WebSQL). Like cookies, some of these technologies may store small amounts of data on your device. We may use these and various other technologies for similar purposes as cookies, such as to enforce our terms, prevent fraud, and analyze the use of our service. There are a number of ways to exercise choice regarding these technologies. For example, many popular browsers provide the ability to clear browser storage, commonly in the settings or preferences area; see your browser's help function or support area to learn more. Other technologies, such as Silverlight storage, may be cleared from within the application.\nLast updated: 11 May 2018\nTo see the prior version of this document, please go to www.netflix.com/privacyupdates.\n", "https://help.netflix.com/legal/termsofuse": "\n                        Help Center\n                    \nHelp Center\n                        Sign In\n                    \n                        Start Your Free Month\n                    \n---\n            Back to Help Home\n        \nNetflix provides a personalized subscription service that allows our members to access movies and TV shows (\"Netflix content\") streamed over the Internet to certain Internet-connected TV's, computers and other devices (\"Netflix ready devices\").\nYou have accepted these Terms of Use, which govern your use of our service.

For combinations with other offers, restrictions may apply.\n2.3.

At any time, and for any reason, we may provide a refund, discount, or other consideration to some or all of our members (\"credits\"). The amount and form of such credits, and the decision to provide them, are at our sole and absolute discretion. The provision of credits in one instance does not entitle you to credits in the future for similar instances, nor does it obligate us to provide credits in the future, under any circumstance.\n---Netflix Service4.1. You must be 18 years of age, or the age of majority in your province, territory or country, to become a member of the Netflix service. Individuals under the age of 18, or applicable age of majority, may utilize the service only with the involvement of a parent or legal guardian, under such person's account and otherwise subject to these Terms of Use.\n4.2.

THE NETFLIX SERVICE AND ALL CONTENT AND SOFTWARE ASSOCIATED THEREWITH, OR ANY OTHER FEATURES OR FUNCTIONALITIES ASSOCIATED WITH THE NETFLIX SERVICE, ARE PROVIDED \"AS IS\" AND \"AS AVAILABLE\" WITH ALL FAULTS AND WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND. NETFLIX DOES NOT GUARANTEE, REPRESENT, OR WARRANT THAT YOUR USE OF THE NETFLIX SERVICE WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED OR ERROR-FREE. NETFLIX SPECIFICALLY DISCLAIMS LIABILITY FOR THE USE OF APPLICATIONS, NETFLIX READY DEVICES, AND NETFLIX SOFTWARE (INCLUDING THEIR CONTINUING COMPATIBILITY WITH OUR SERVICE).\n6.2. TO THE EXTENT PERMISSIBLE UNDER APPLICABLE LAWS, IN NO EVENT SHALL NETFLIX, OR ITS SUBSIDIARIES OR ANY OF THEIR SHAREHOLDERS, DIRECTORS, OFFICERS, EMPLOYEES OR LICENSORS BE LIABLE (JOINTLY OR SEVERALLY) TO YOU FOR PERSONAL INJURY OR ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, INDIRECT OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY KIND, OR ANY DAMAGES WHATSOEVER.\n6.3. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF CERTAIN WARRANTIES OR THE LIMITATION OR EXCLUSION OF LIABILITY FOR CERTAIN TYPES OF DAMAGES. THEREFORE, SOME OF THE ABOVE LIMITATIONS IN THIS SECTION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.\n6.4. NOTHING IN THESE TERMS OF USE SHALL AFFECT ANY NON-WAIVABLE STATUTORY RIGHTS THAT APPLY TO YOU.\n---Arbitration Agreement7.1. If you are a Netflix member in the United States (including its possessions and territories), you and Netflix agree that any dispute, claim or controversy arising out of or relating in any way to the Netflix service, these Terms of Use and this Arbitration Agreement, shall be determined by binding arbitration or in small claims court. Arbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in court. Arbitration uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, allows for more limited discovery than in court, and is subject to very limited review by courts. Arbitrators can award the same damages and relief that a court can award and nothing in this Arbitration Agreement shall be interpreted as limiting any non-waivable statutory rights. You agree that, by agreeing to these Terms of Use, the U.S. Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this provision, and that you and Netflix are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate in a class action. This arbitration provision shall survive termination of this Agreement and the termination of your Netflix membership.\n7.2. If you elect to seek arbitration or file a small claim court action, you must first send to Netflix, by certified mail, a written Notice of your claim (\"Notice\"). The Notice to Netflix must be addressed to: General Counsel, Netflix, Inc., 100 Winchester Circle, Los Gatos, CA 95032-1815 (\"Notice Address\"). If Netflix initiates arbitration, it will send a written Notice to the email address used for your membership account. A Notice, whether sent by you or by Netflix, must (a) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute; and (b) set forth the specific relief sought (\"Demand\"). If Netflix and you do not reach an agreement to resolve the claim within 30 days after the Notice is received, you or Netflix may commence an arbitration proceeding or file a claim in small claims court.\n7.3. You may download or copy a form Notice and a form to initiate arbitration at www.adr.org. If you are required to pay a filing fee, after Netflix receives notice at the Notice Address that you have commenced arbitration, Netflix will reimburse you for your payment of the filing fee, unless your claim is for greater than US$10,000, in which event you will be responsible for filing fees.\n7.4. The arbitration will be governed by the Commercial Arbitration Rules (the \"AAA Rules\") of the American Arbitration Association (\"AAA\"), as modified by this Agreement, and will be administered by the AAA. The AAA Rules and Forms are available online at www.adr.org, by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879, or by writing to the Notice Address. The arbitrator is bound by the terms of this Agreement. All issues are for the arbitrator to decide, including issues relating to the scope and enforceability of this arbitration agreement. Unless Netflix and you agree otherwise, any arbitration hearings will take place in the county (or parish) of your residence. The arbitrator's award shall be final and binding on all parties, except (1) for judicial review expressly permitted by law or (2) if the arbitrator's award includes an award of injunctive relief against a party, in which case that party shall have the right to seek judicial review of the injunctive relief in a court of competent jurisdiction that shall not be bound by the arbitrator's application or conclusions of law.\n7.5. If your claim is for US$10,000 or less, we agree that you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator, through a telephonic hearing, or by an in-person hearing as established by the AAA Rules.

For example:\n---When you submit content (such as a post or comment or public chat) to the Services, any visitors to and users of our Services will be able to see that content, the username associated with the content, and the date and time you originally submitted the content. Reddit allows other websites to embed public Reddit content via our embed tools. Reddit also allows third parties to access public Reddit content via the Reddit API and via other similar technologies. Although some parts of the Services may be private or quarantined, they may become public (e.g., at the moderator\u2019s option in the case of private communities) and you should take that into consideration before posting to the Services.---When you send private messages, messages via modmail, or private chats, the recipients of those messages will be able to see the content of your message, your username, and the date and time the message was sent. Keep in mind that additional users may be invited to join a private chat after you send a message. Moderators may elect to have modmail forwarded to their email accounts and, as a result, any modmail received by these moderators will be subject to the terms and policies of the moderator\u2019s email provider.---When other users view your profile, they will be able to see information about your activities on the Services, such as your username, prior posts and comments, karma, trophies, moderator status, Reddit Gold status, and how long you have been a member of the Services.

Your use of these features enables the sharing of certain information with your friends or the public, depending on the settings you establish with the third party that provides the social sharing feature. For more information about the purpose and scope of data collection and processing in connection with social sharing features, please visit the privacy policies of the third parties that provide these social sharing features (e.g., Tumblr, Facebook, and Twitter).Please note that, even when you delete your account, the posts, comments and messages you submit through the Services may still be viewable or available on our servers.

The partner\u2019s use of personal data will be subject to appropriate confidentiality and security measures.---To comply with the law.\u00a0 We may share information in response to a request for information if we believe disclosure is in accordance with, or required by, any applicable law, regulation, legal process or governmental request, including, but not limited to, meeting national security or law enforcement requirements.

Our\u00a0Transparency Report has additional information about how we respond to government requests.---In an emergency.\u00a0 We may share information if we believe it's necessary to prevent imminent and serious bodily harm to a person.---To enforce our policies and rights.\u00a0 We may share information if we believe your actions are inconsistent with our user agreements, rules, or other Reddit policies, or to protect the rights, property, and safety of ourselves and others.---With our affiliates.\u00a0 We may share information between and among Reddit, and any of our parents, affiliates, subsidiaries, and other companies under common control and ownership.---With your consent.\u00a0 We may share information about you with your consent or at your direction.---Aggregated or de-identified information.\u00a0 We may share information about you that has been aggregated or anonymized such that it cannot reasonably be used to identify you. For example, we may show the total number of times a post has been upvoted without identifying who the visitors were.\n \nAds and Analytics Partners\nWe may partner with third-party advertisers, ad networks, and analytics providers to deliver advertising and content targeted to your interests and to better understand your use of the Services. These third parties may collect information sent by your computer, browser, or mobile device in response to a request for content, such as unique identifiers, your IP address, or other information about your computer or device. For example:\nAdvertisers and Ad Networks\nOur ad partners and ad networks may use cookies and related technologies to collect information when ads are delivered to you on our Services, but Reddit does not link to or provide them with your actual Reddit account details. This means that Reddit does not share your individual account browsing habits with advertisers. Reddit cannot see advertisers\u2019 cookies and advertisers will not see Reddit cookies.\u00a0\nAnalytics Partners\nWe use analytics partners (such as Google Analytics) to help analyze usage and traffic for our Services. As an example, we may use analytics partners to analyze and measure, in the aggregate, the number of unique visitors to our Services.\n \nYour Choices\nAs a Reddit user, you have choices about how to protect and limit the collection, use, and disclosure of information about you.\nAccessing and Changing Your Information\nYou can access and change certain information through the Services. See our Help Center page for more information.\nDeleting Your Account\nYou may delete your account information at any time from the user preferences page. When you delete your account, your profile is no longer visible to other users and disassociated from content you posted under that account. Please note, however, that the posts, comments, and messages you submitted prior to deleting your account will still be visible to others unless you first delete the specific content. We may also retain certain information about you as required by law or for legitimate business purposes after you delete your account.\u00a0\nControlling Linked Services\u2019 Access to Your Account\nYou can review the services you have linked to your account and revoke access to individual services here.\u00a0\nControlling the Use of Cookies\nMost web browsers are set to accept cookies by default. If you prefer, you can usually choose to set your browser to remove or reject first- and third-party cookies. Please note that if you choose to remove or reject cookies, this could affect the availability and functionality of our Services.\nControlling Advertising and Analytics\nSome analytics providers we partner with may provide specific opt-out mechanisms and we may provide, as needed and as available, additional tools and third-party services that allow you to better understand cookies and how you can opt-out. For example, you may manage the use and collection of certain information by Google Analytics here.\nWe also offer you choices about receiving personalized advertisements. You can adjust how we personalize advertisements for you by visiting your ads preferences here. You may also generally opt out of receiving personalized advertisements from certain third-party advertisers and ad networks.

However, there is no accepted standard for how a website should respond to this signal, and we do not take any action in response to this signal. Instead, in addition to publicly available third-party tools, we offer you the choices described in this policy to manage the collection and use of information about you.\nControlling Promotional Communications\nYou may opt out of receiving some or all categories of promotional communications from us by following the instructions in those communications or by updating your email options in your account preferences here. If you opt out of promotional communications, we may still send you non-promotional communications, such as information about your account or your use of the Services.\nControlling Mobile Notifications\nWith your consent, we may send promotional and non-promotional push notifications or alerts to your mobile device.

We may retain certain information for legitimate business purposes or as required by law.\nInternational Data Transfers\nWe are based in the United States and we process and store information on servers located in the United States.

We are subject to the investigatory and enforcement powers of the Federal Trade Commission. If we share EU or Swiss data with a third-party service provider that processes the data solely on our behalf, then we will be liable for that third party\u2019s processing of EU or Swiss data in violation of the Privacy Shield principles, unless we can prove that we are not responsible for the event giving rise to the damage.\nFor more information about the Privacy Shield principles and to view our certification, please visit the U.S. Department of Commerce\u2019s Privacy Shield website.\nAdditional Information for EEA Users\nUsers in the European Economic Area have the right to request access to, rectification of, or erasure of their personal data; to data portability in certain circumstances; to request restriction of processing; to object to processing; and to withdraw consent for processing where they have previously provided consent.

We respect the intellectual property rights of others and ask that you do the same. We have a process for submitting complaints regarding content posted by our members. Our policy and procedures are described below.As a member, when you post full-text articles or supplementary materials on ResearchGate, you do not transfer or assign copyright to us.\u2002Rather, you make the content available to the public through ResearchGate. You retain the right to remove such content from ResearchGate at any time, or to archive your content so it is available only to you and your co-author(s).\u2002You may also remove content from appearing on your profile page.Our platform enables the private archiving and public posting of various types of content. If you choose to privately archive or publicly post content, we encourage you to first confirm your rights before doing so. This applies to posting content to your own profile as well as other places on the platform, such as in a Q&A forum or a project. As we do not have any information about rights you may hold, or any license terms or other restrictions which might apply to such content, we necessarily rely on you to understand your rights and act accordingly. For this reason, we request that you fully investigate and confirm that you have sufficient rights to post particular content to ResearchGate before you do so. As a general matter, if you are an author publishing in a journal, you may be allowed to publish certain versions of your article, but not others, and privately share certain content with others. However, many journals restrict publication of final versions and impose limitations on private sharing.Your starting point for understanding your rights is the agreement(s) you have with your publisher or other rights owner. If you\u2019re still unsure about what you\u2019re allowed to share on ResearchGate, we recommend that you get in touch directly with your publisher. There are other resources available that you might also find useful in understanding your rights, such as How Can I Share It (http://www.howcanishareit.com). We also provide some general information in our Help Center.It is our policy to respond to notices of claimed copyright infringement submitted by rights owners in accordance with the notice and takedown procedures found in section 512(c) of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (United States) and the European eCommerce Directive, detailed below. Our Designated Agent for receiving notices of claimed copyright and other intellectual property infringement is:Copyright AgentResearchGate GmbHChausseestr. 20,Berlin, Germany 10115Email: copyright@researchgate.netTelephone: +49 (0) 30 200051-100Please be aware that, regardless of whether we disable access to or remove the content complained about, we may forward your written notification, including your contact information, to the member who posted the content, and/or take other reasonable steps to notify the member that we have received notice of an alleged violation of copyright or intellectual property rights.Please also remember that, if you choose to request removal of content by submitting an infringement notification, you are initiating a legal process. Any notice or counter-notice you submit must be truthful and must be submitted under penalty of perjury. A false notice or counter-notice may give rise to personal liability. You may therefore wish to seek the advice of legal counsel before submitting a notice or counter-notice.Please note that if you are not a copyright owner or authorized to act on behalf of a copyright owner, we must ask that you contact the copyright owner and ask them to submit a notice of claimed infringement. If you are a copyright owner, US, European and other laws require that your notice of claimed infringement follow a specific form. The easiest way to do this is to complete our simple form and send it to copyright@researchgate.net:NOCI FormIt provides us with a required signature and information about you or your company that we will keep on file. You can save a copy of the form to prevent you having to fill in your contact information next time. If you do not wish to use our form, you can use your own form or send an email to copyright@researchgate.net, so long as it contains all the required information, including:---The name, address, telephone number, and e-mail address of the complaining party.---A description of the copyrighted work(s) or other intellectual property claimed to have been infringed and the country of claimed rights.---A description of where the allegedly infringing material is located on ResearchGate, with information sufficient to permit us to locate the material. In order for us to be able to accurately identify and remove content notified to be infringing, it is necessary to provide the specific URL for the actual file and not the URL of the publication page where the file is displayed, as the content displayed on a publication page can change. You can identify the URL of a particular file by clicking on the downward-facing arrow at the top-right corner of a publication page, selecting \"Full-text sources,\" right clicking on the respective download button of the file and copying the link address. ---A statement that the complaining party \u201chas a good faith belief that the use of the material in the manner complained of is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law.\u201d---A statement that \u201cthe information in this notification is accurate, and under penalty of perjury, the complaining party is authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.\u201d---An electronic or physical signature of the person authorized to act on behalf of the owner of the copyright or other right that is allegedly infringed.Note: If you are asserting infringement of an intellectual property right other than copyright, please specify the intellectual property right at issue (for example, \"trademark\").Upon receiving notice of a claimed infringement that complies with the above requirements, we will expeditiously remove or disable access to the allegedly infringing material and will notify the member who posted it. At that time, we will also provide the member with an email address which may be used to contact the complaining party with any questions, or if they think a mistake has been made.In accordance with applicable law, we have a repeat infringer policy that provides for the disabling of a member's uploading rights or termination of their membership in appropriate circumstances.ResearchGate recognizes that sometimes content may be mistakenly identified by a rights owner as infringing their rights. In the event such a mistake occurs, you should first contact the complaining party directly using the email address provided to you. ResearchGate will allow you to re-upload the content upon receipt of an acknowledgement of the error from the complaining party.If the complaining party does not agree that their request for removal was in error, you may submit a counter notice using this Counter Notice Form.Alternatively, you can submit a written communication to ResearchGate\u2019s Designated Agent (contact details above). To be effective, your counter notice must include substantially the following:---Your name, address and telephone number.---Identification of the material that has been removed or to which access has been disabled and the location (URL) at which the material appeared before it was removed or access to it was disabled.---A statement under penalty of perjury that you have a good faith belief that the material was removed or disabled as a result of mistake or misidentification of the material to be removed or disabled.---A statement that you consent to the jurisdiction of Federal District Court for the judicial district in which your address is located, or if your address is outside the United States, for any judicial district in which ResearchGate may be found, and that you will accept service of process from the party who submitted the notification of claimed infringement or an agent of that party.---Your physical or electronic signature.We will not be able to consider your counter notice unless you fill out the form in its entirety, and physically sign it. Please make sure that the counter notice you send to ResearchGate is legible; if we cannot read your handwriting we will not be able to process it.Upon receiving the original of your fully completed counter notice, ResearchGate will provide the complaining party with a copy of your notice. We will also inform them that we will allow you to replace the removed material after 10 business days, unless ResearchGate\u2019s Designated Agent receives notice from the complaining party that it has filed an action seeking a court order to restrain you from engaging in infringing activity relating to the material on ResearchGate. If the complaining party notifies us in writing that they no longer object to the material being made available, we will allow you to repost it.\norJoin for freeLog in\n", "https://www.researchgate.net/privacy-policy": "\n    \n \nPrivacy Policy | ResearchGate, the professional network for scientists.\nFor full functionality of ResearchGate it is necessary to enable JavaScript.\n            Here are the \n                instructions how to enable JavaScript in your web browser.\nLast updated: October 23rd, 2017.Table of contents:---Introduction---Information we collect and how we collect it---How we use information we collect about you---Sharing of Personal Information with third parties---Transfers of Personal Information outside of the European Economic Area---Security---Closing your account and retention of Personal Information---Data subject rights---Objection---Additional information---Contact information1.

Our Service is a dynamic, innovative environment, which means we are always seeking to improve the services we offer you. We may introduce material new features, which may result in the collection of new information and in different ways; if we do so, we will inform you by updating this Privacy Policy.C. Information we automatically collectWe and service providers acting on our behalf store log files and use tracking technologies such as cookies, web beacons, tracking pixels, and local shared objects, also known as flash cookies, to collect information relating to you and your use of the Service.\u201cCookies\u201d are small files that enable us to store and collect specific information related to you and your use of the Service on your computer or other end devices. They help us to analyze the number of people who use the Service, usage frequency, User behavior, advertising effectiveness, to increase security and tailor our Service to your needs and preferences.After you have logged in to your account on the Service, we use so-called \u201csession cookies\u201d to identify you during the course of your session. Upon the termination of your session, the session cookie is automatically deleted.We also use \u201cpersistent cookies\u201d to record information about repeat Users of the Service. Persistent cookies are designed to help us continually improve the products and services we offer you. Persistent cookies do not contain Personal Information such as your name, IP address, etc.You can edit the settings of your browser to prevent cookies from being stored, to limit the storage of cookies to certain websites, or such that your browser informs you every time a cookie is sent. You can also delete cookies from your computer\u2019s hard drive at any time. However, please note that if cookies are deactivated you will not be able to take advantage of some of ResearchGate\u2019s features.In addition to cookies, ResearchGate uses so-called pixels, web beacons, clear GIFs, and other similar mechanisms (\u201cPixels\u201d). A Pixel is an image file or link to an image file added to the website code but not sent to your end device (e.g. PC, smartphone, etc.). Pixels are largely used for the same reasons as cookies, i.e. to analyze the number of people who use our Service or, if the User's email program allows HTML, to determine whether and when an email was opened. Pixels help us to check and optimize the effectiveness of our Service and offers as well as advertising campaigns served on ResearchGate. Pixels do not provide us with Personal Information and do not enable us to track Users. Pixels are usually used in conjunction with cookies. If you have deactivated the use of cookies in your browser, then Pixels will only report an anonymous website visit.We also use pixel-based and cookie-based conversion tracking technologies to, for example, measure the success of advertising campaigns served on ResearchGate. To this end we use technologies provided by Google.The information we automatically collect about you and your use of the Service includes:---IP addresses;---the type of computer or mobile device you are using;---your operating system and version;---your mobile device's identifiers, like your MAC Address, Identifier for Advertising (IDFA), and/or International Mobile Equipment Identity (IMEI);---types of browser used;---your browser language;---referring and exit pages, and URLs;---platform type;---the number of clicks on a page or feature;---domain names;---country;---landing pages accessed;---pages viewed and the order of those pages; ---the amount of time spent on particular pages or parts of pages; and---information collected for performance purposes (e.g. average load, render time of pages, etc.).D. Information about you from third partiesWe receive information about you and your activities on and off the Service from third party partners, such as information from advertisers about your experience or interactions with them. We also obtain information about you from publicly available sources, such as information regarding previous research published by you and affiliations that may be associated with your profile.E. Third party advertising including tailored advertising and analyticsWe have advertising on our Service so we can continue to offer many of our features for free. We do not share Personal Information with third party advertisers for their direct marketing purposes unless you give us your prior consent.When advertisers or ad networks place advertisements on our Service, they may collect or we may share the following types of information from within our Service:---performance data (such as the number of clicks on an advertisement);---aggregated and/or de-identified information about you and other Users collectively that is not intended to specifically identify you (such as Users who live in Berlin);---certain technical information (for example, IP addresses, non-persistent device identifiers such as Identifiers for Advertising (IDFAs), and de-identified persistent device identifiers such as a hashed Android ID); and---other contextual data about your use of the Service (for example, your session length).Advertisers or ad networks may collect this information through the use of tracking technologies like browser cookies and web beacons (see explanations above), and they may use a single tracking technology or multiple tracking technologies at the same time.The information collected may be used to:---measure how effective advertisements are;---offer you targeted advertising in order to personalize your experience by showing you advertisements that are more relevant to you; and/or---undertake web analytics to analyze traffic and other User activity to improve your experience.After clicking on a third-party advertisement, you may no longer be on a site hosted by ResearchGate. ResearchGate cannot be responsible for any third party, or its affiliates or agents, failing to use your Personal Information in accordance with such third party's privacy policy, or any contractual or other legal obligations to which such third party, its affiliates or agents, may be subject.For more information about our use of cookies, and how to modify or delete them, see our Cookie Policy.F. Use of Google servicesResearchGate reserves the right to use certain Google services, operated by Google, Inc., California, USA (\u201cGoogle\u201d). Google services may include Google Analytics, a web analytics service, Google Analytics Advertising Features, namely for remarketing with Google Analytics, Google Display Network Impression Reporting, Google Analytics Demographics and Interest Reporting, and integrated services that require Google Analytics to collect data via advertising cookies and anonymous identifiers, and Google\u2019s DoubleClick Services. Any information generated by the cookies about your use of the Service (including your IP address) will be transmitted to and stored by Google on servers in the United States of America. Google will use this information for the purpose of evaluating your use of the Service, compiling reports on website activity for us, and providing other services relating to website activity and Internet usage. Google may also transfer this information to third parties where required to do so by law. More information about Google\u2019s data privacy and security can be found here. Please see Google\u2019s page on \u2018How Google uses data when you use our partners' sites or apps\u2019, and Google\u2019s terms and policies for further information.With respect to Google Analytics, the following additional safeguards apply: we have activated IP anonymization so that your IP address will be shortened by Google within the European Economic Area before the data is forwarded and stored in the USA; only in exceptional cases are IP addresses sent to a Google server in the USA and shortened there. Google will not combine your IP address collected via Google Analytics with other data that Google holds.To opt out from Google Analytics, please click here.G. CommunicationsMany communications that you initiate through our Service (for example, an invitation sent to a non-Member) will list your name in the header of the message. Messages you initiate may also provide the recipient with aggregate information about your network (for example, how many people are in your network). Other communications that you initiate through the Service, like a request for a full-text, will list your name as the initiator but will not include your personal email address. Once you have connected with an individual, regardless of who sent the invitation, your contact information that you choose to include in your researcher profile will be shared with that individual.3. How we use information we collect about youThe Personal Information that you provide to us may reveal or allow others to identify aspects of your life that are not expressly stated on your profile (for example, your picture or your name may reveal your gender).We use the Personal Information described above to:---Enable you to benefit from the Service. We process your Personal Information in order to provide the Service in a way that is tailored to your interests. This allows us to administer your account with ResearchGate and customize the services ResearchGate provides to you through the Service. For example, we will process your Personal Information to provide dynamic web pages that are individually adapted to you.---Conduct research. We conduct research and development for the improvement of our Service and the User experience.---Offer you tailored advertising content. We aim at offering you advertising content that is the most relevant to you. In this context, we use, whether separately or combined, the Personal Information you provide, we collect, or we infer from your use of the Service and the Internet. This enables us to display advertisements that best match to your particular interests.In order to show these advertisements and measure their performance on and off our Service, we work with a variety of business partners.If you wish to opt out of being served targeted advertising, you may click the cross at the top right-hand side of ads you are served, or edit the settings of your browser(s). Please be aware that this will not opt you out of being served advertising. Only interest-based advertising will no longer be shown to you.---Communicate with you. We may use your Personal Information to communicate with you about ResearchGate and products or services by email, postal mail, telephone, text message, or other means.If you wish to stop receiving promotional communications from us, you can follow the unsubscribe instructions at the bottom of each email we send, contact us here or, if you have an account with us, change your preferences by signing into your account through the Service.---Ensure the security of your Personal Information. We process your Personal Information in order to avoid its accidental or unlawful destruction, as well as its loss, alteration, or unauthorized disclosure. For example, we process the number of profile pages you view so as to detect and prevent data harvesting. Likewise, we truncate the last octet of your IP address to prevent you from being identified.---Generate statistics. We use your Personal Information to generate statistics which pertain to reading behavior or achievements. We also generate statistics for internal purposes in order to constantly improve the Service and its features.You can object at any time to processing of your Personal Information for statistical purposes by contacting us here.4. Sharing of Personal Information with third partiesGenerally, ResearchGate does not share the Personal Information collected - or that you provide to ResearchGate - with third parties unless we have obtained your prior consent. Note, however, that ResearchGate reserves the right to share the Personal Information it has about you with vendors, agents, and contractors who assist ResearchGate in administering the Service and in providing benefits to you. We may also share Personal Information in response to legal process or when the law requires it (for example, in response to a court order) or, to the extent permitted by applicable law, to protect the rights, property or safety of ResearchGate, the Service, Users of the Service (including you), and others.ResearchGate may also disclose Personal Information as is necessary to identify, contact, or bring legal action against a person or entity who may be violating ResearchGate\u2019s Terms of Service, or who may be causing harm to, or interfering with, other Users of the Service. In addition, in the event that assets of ResearchGate are transferred or sold to another entity, Personal Information may be transferred to the acquiring entity and/or to potential acquiring entities to the extent permitted by applicable law and we will seek your consent where required. 5. Transfers of Personal Information outside of the European Economic AreaThe Personal Information that ResearchGate collects from you and that you provide to ResearchGate is processed in Canada and is stored on servers in Canada. The Canadian Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documentation Act has been deemed to provide adequate and similar protection to that which applies within the European Economic Area. Your Personal Information may also be transferred to any third parties as described in this Privacy Policy. Some of these third parties with whom your Personal Information will be shared are located outside of the European Economic Area, in countries whose data protection laws may not be as extensive as those which apply to us. If we transfer your Personal Information to countries outside of the European Economic Area or which do not offer adequate and similar protection, we will ensure that we do this in accordance with applicable data protection regulations (for example, by putting in place an appropriate data transfer agreement). We will do this with a view to ensuring the level of protection which applies to your Personal Information processed in these countries is similar to that which applies within the European Economic Area.6. SecurityWe will take all steps reasonably necessary to ensure your Personal Information is treated securely and in accordance with this Privacy Policy and applicable law. We use appropriate security measures to protect against unauthorized access, collection, use, disclosure, copying, and disposal of your Personal Information. All pages are secured using SSL (Secure Socket Layer) technology, which encrypts data between our computer and your end devices. To make sure your Internet browser is using the latest security features, you may want to download the most recent version of it, which should have full SSL support. You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your User ID and password which relate to your access to certain pages of the Service and/or any account you set up with us. You agree to accept responsibility for all activities which occur in relation to the same. You should not permit other people to use your User ID or your password. Please contact us promptly if you believe your User ID or password may have been compromised. We will not be responsible to you if there is unauthorized access to your login details or unauthorized activity on the Service as a result of your login details becoming known by someone else, unless this was due to our negligence.Despite our efforts regarding security it is important to bear in mind that the Internet is not a secure means of communication. Personal Information communicated through the Internet may be intercepted by other people. We cannot guarantee the security of Personal Information sent to us through the Service. You accept that you use the Service at your own risk.7. Closing your account and retention of Personal InformationIf you have created an account through the Service, we will close your account upon your request. We may also close or disable inactive accounts or accounts that are used in violation of our Terms of Service or any applicable law. We will retain Personal Information from closed or inactive accounts to the extent and as long as it is necessary and relevant for our operations and/or to comply with law, prevent fraud, collect any fees owed, resolve disputes, troubleshoot problems, assist with any investigations, enforce our Terms of Service, and/or take other actions otherwise permitted by law.In general, Personal Information from closed or inactive accounts will be deleted or anonymized one year after the account is closed or deactivated unless we have reasonable grounds to believe that the Personal Information should be retained for one of the purposes identified above. 8. Data subject rightsYou may be entitled to exercise some or all of the following rights free of charge (such rights may vary depending on the requirements of the applicable legislation):---require (i) information about whether your Personal Information is retained and (ii) access to and/or (iii) duplicates of your Personal Information retained, including the purposes of the processing, the categories of Personal Information concerned, and the recipients or categories of recipients to whom the Personal Information is disclosed and where possible, the envisaged period for which the Personal Information will be stored, or, if not possible, the criteria used to determine that period;---request proper rectification, removal, or restriction of your Personal Information, e.g. because (i) of the incomplete or inaccurate nature of the Personal Information, (ii) it is no longer needed for the purposes for which it was collected, (iii) the consent on which the processing was based has been withdrawn, or (iv) you have taken advantage of an existing right to object to the data processing; in case your Personal Information is processed by third parties, we will also forward your request for rectification, removal, or restriction to such third parties unless this proves impossible or involves disproportionate effort;---receive the Personal Information concerning you, which you have provided to us, in a structured, commonly used, and machine-readable format and to transmit those data to another controller without hindrance from our side; where technically feasible you shall have the right to have the Personal Information transmitted directly from us to another controller;---refuse to provide and \u2013 without impact to data processing activities that have taken place before such withdrawal \u2013 withdraw your consent to processing of your Personal Information at any time;---not to be subject to any automatic individual decisions (automatic decisions based on data processing by automatic means, for the purpose of assessing several personal aspects) which produce legal effects on you or similarly significantly affect you.You may (i) exercise the rights referred to above or (ii) pose any questions or (iii) make any complaints regarding the data processing by contacting us here.9.

General informationResearchGate GmbH, Chausseestr. 20, 10115 Berlin, Germany (\u201cResearchGate\u201d, \u201cwe\u201d, \u201cus\u201d, or \u201cour\u201d) provides the services made available at www.researchgate.net and all other websites operated by ResearchGate and all associated applications, including mobile applications (\u201cService\u201d), as an information society service in the meaning of Article 1(b) of Directive (EU) 2015/1535. Full ResearchGate contact information is available here.ResearchGate\u2019s mission is to connect the world of science and make research open to all. Any natural or legal person who, as a recipient of the Service, accesses or uses the Service for any purpose is a User (\u201cUser\u201d, \u201cyou\u201d). Our registered Users (\u201cMembers\u201d) share their professional identities and credentials, display their academic publications, engage and collaborate with their networks, exchange knowledge and professional insights, post and view relevant content, and discover business and career opportunities. Some content is also visible to unregistered and logged-out Users (\u201cVisitors\u201d).2. Conclusion of agreementThese Terms, which include the documents referenced above, constitute a legally binding agreement between ResearchGate and any of its Members. A Visitor may be asked to accept these Terms in order to use a certain limited number of features on the Service, such as requesting a full-text or other content made available on the Service, or applying for a job. The Terms become binding once we accept your offer to enter into a binding agreement with us, e.g., once you have submitted the registration process and we have sent confirmation that you have successfully registered for the Service. In some jurisdictions, you may be bound to these Terms if you repeatedly access the Service against our instructions.3. Scope of the ServiceThe Service provides you with the ability to add, create, upload, submit, distribute, or post (\u201csubmit\u201d, \u201csubmitting\u201d, or \u201csubmission\u201d) content, articles, data, text, photographs, images, illustrations, or other information on or to the Service (collectively, the \u201cMember Submissions\u201d). By way of example, and not as a limitation, Member Submissions may be submitted when you request the Service to (i) identify, resolve, copy, or import content stored on your or a third party\u2019s computer system, (ii) synchronize content such that the Service stores or \u201cmirrors\u201d content stored on your or a third party\u2019s computer system by storing such content on equipment owned or operated by ResearchGate, (iii) save or store your comments, edits, or annotations to content accessible through the Service, or (iv) share with another person any content stored on your or a third party\u2019s computer system.The Service consists largely of information uploaded by and/or stored upon the request of Members. We do not preview or review or filter such information, neither manually nor automatically. Therefore, we do not and cannot have current knowledge of possible infringements, inappropriate content, or violations of law caused by information that is uploaded by and/or stored upon the request of Members. We are not liable for such information (Digital Millennium Copyright Act, 17 U.S.C. section 512; Article 14 of Directive 2000/31/EC).

User ObligationsResearchGate strives to connect the world of science. It is essential for the credibility of the world of science and for the reputation of researchers that researchers identify themselves using their real names and their affiliation. You must therefore provide only true and non-misleading statements and your real name; you may not use pseudonyms or pen names. You may not accept, adopt, or post content that falsely or misleadingly implies an incorrect identity, inaccurate biographical facts, or misleading information about your qualifications, work experience, or achievements.You warrant and represent that all Personal Information you provide is accurate and complete. You are obliged to update such data when it changes. If you choose to use a profile photo, you must use a photo where you can be clearly identified; images of other people, animals, text, and logos are not permitted. This again is essential for the credibility of the researchers using the Service and is in the best interest of the world of science.You are responsible to ensure that the use or other exploitation of any Member Submissions by you as contemplated by these Terms does not infringe or violate the rights of any third party, including without limitation any privacy rights, publicity rights, patent, copyrights, contract rights, or any other intellectual property or proprietary rights. Except in the case of Member Submissions containing content exclusively in the public domain, you represent and warrant, and can demonstrate to our full satisfaction upon request that (i) you own or otherwise control any and all rights or licenses required in order to submit or share all content in your Member Submissions and you consent to the use of such content as contemplated by these Terms, and (ii) you have full authority to act on behalf of any and all owners of any right, title, or interest in and to any content in your Member Submissions to use such content as contemplated by these Terms.You understand that all information publicly posted or privately transmitted through the Service is the sole responsibility of the person by whom such content was submitted.

Cardinal contractual duties are an abstract description of those obligations whose fulfilment is indispensable for the proper implementation of an agreement and on whose fulfilment the contracting parties can usually rely. Any other liability on the part of ResearchGate is excluded.12. IndemnityYou will indemnify and hold ResearchGate (including our affiliates and subsidiaries, as well as our and their respective officers, directors, employees, agents) harmless from any claim or demand, including reasonable legal fees, made by any third party due to or arising out of your breach of these Terms, your improper use of the Service, or your breach of any law or your violation of the rights of a third party.13. Applicable lawExcept as provided below in Section 17 with respect to U.S. Users, these Terms shall be governed by the laws of the Federal Republic of Germany, except for its conflicts of laws principles and the CISG (United Nations Convention on the International Sale of Goods).If the User is a consumer in the sense of Article 6 of EU Regulation 593/2008 and has their habitual residence outside of Germany, provisions which, in the absence of choice, would have been applicable and which cannot, by virtue of law, be derogated from by agreement, shall remain unaffected.14. International jurisdiction / Venue for legal disputes / Consumer dispute resolutionExcept as provided below in Section 17 with respect to U.S. Users, the courts of the Federal Republic of Germany shall have sole jurisdiction over any disputes arising out of or in connection with these Terms. This does not apply if the User is a consumer in the sense of Article 17 of EU Regulation No. 1215/2012 and is residing in a Member State of the EU; in this case the international jurisdiction is governed by Article 18 of EU Regulation No. 1215/2012.If the User (i) is a merchant, a legal person under public law, or special funds under public law, and is either a resident of Germany or resides outside of the European Union (EU), or (ii) is resident of another Member State of the EU and is not a consumer in the sense of Article 17 of EU Regulation No. 1215/2012, or (iii) has its residence outside of the EU, the courts of Berlin, Germany, shall have sole jurisdiction over any disputes arising out of or in connection with these Terms.Statutory provisions regarding exclusive jurisdiction shall remain unaffected.The EU Commission provides an Online Dispute Resolution (ODR) platform for the out-of-court resolution of disputes concerning contractual obligations with consumers (as defined in Article 4 of EU Directive No 11/2013).

MiscellaneousWe are permitted to transfer rights and duties to third parties, in whole or in part. Section 10 applies.If ResearchGate does not act to enforce a breach of these Terms, that does not mean ResearchGate has waived its rights to enforce these Terms.If any provision or portion of these Terms is held to be or becomes invalid, illegal, unenforceable, or in conflict with the law of any applicable jurisdiction, the validity, legality, and enforceability of the remaining provisions shall not in any way be affected or impaired thereby.These Terms are only available and binding in their English-language version.Additional Terms of Service for United States residents only (\u201cAdditional U.S. Terms\u201d)The following Additional U.S. Terms apply only to United States residents and apply in addition to the Terms set out above.

This does not apply to damages, disadvantages, and loss of profit that are caused by us intentionally or recklessly. Some laws do not allow the limitation or exclusion of liability, so these limits may not apply to you. However, if you are a resident of the State of New Jersey, these limitations and exclusions do apply to you.If you have a dispute with one or more Users, you release us (and our affiliates and subsidiaries, and our and their respective officers, directors, employees and agents) from claims, demands, and damages (actual and consequential) of every kind and nature, known and unknown, arising out of or in any way connected with such disputes.

Accordingly, neither of us may start a formal proceeding (except for Claims described in the \u201cExceptions\u201d section below) for at least 30 days after one of us notifies the other of a Claim in writing. Notice of the Claim will include a brief written statement that sets forth the name, address, and contact information of the party giving it, the facts giving rise to the dispute, claim, or controversy and the relief requested. You will send your notice by email to copyright@researchgate.net AND to this address: ResearchGate GmbH, Chausseestr. 20, 10115 Berlin, Germany.

You can find a copy of a Demand for Arbitration at www.jamsadr.com.---Send three copies of the Demand for Arbitration, plus the appropriate filing fee, to: JAMS, 500 North State College Blvd., Suite 600, Orange, CA 92868 (1-800-352-5267).---Send one copy of the Demand for Arbitration to us at ResearchGate GmbH, Chausseestr. 20, 10115 Berlin, Germany.Special Rules. In the arbitration proceeding, the arbitrator has no authority to make errors of law, and any award may be challenged if the arbitrator does so. Otherwise, the arbitrator\u2019s decision is final and binding on all parties and may be enforced in any federal or state court that has jurisdiction. Neither you nor we shall be entitled to join or consolidate claims in arbitration by or against other individuals or entities, or arbitrate any claim as a representative member of a class or in a private attorney general capacity. Accordingly, you and we agree that the JAMS Class Action Procedures do not apply to our arbitration. A court may sever any portion of Section 17 that it finds to be unenforceable, except for the prohibition on class, representative, and private attorney general arbitration.Exceptions.\u00a0Notwithstanding the foregoing, disputes, claims, or controversies concerning patents, copyrights, moral rights, trademarks, and trade secrets and claims of piracy or unauthorized use of the Service, including disputes involving a violation of the Communications Act of 1934, 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 605, or the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, 17 U.S.C. \u00a7 1201, or the Electronic Communications Privacy Act, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2510-2521, or any other statement or law governing theft of service, shall not be subject to arbitration as set out in this Section 17 and may be decided only by a court of competent jurisdiction. Moreover, you may choose to pursue your claim in small claims court where jurisdiction and venue over ResearchGate and you otherwise qualify for such small claims court and where your claim does not include a request for any type of equitable relief.Personal User right to opt out. If you are a Personal User, you have the right to opt out and not be bound by the binding arbitration requirement by sending written notice of your decision to opt out to the email address copyright@researchgate.net. The notice must be sent within 30 days of the effective date of these Terms or your first use of the Service, whichever is later. If you opt out of the binding arbitration requirement, we also will not be bound by the requirement. Professional Users may not opt out of the binding arbitration requirements.Changes to this section. We will provide 30 days\u2019 notice of any changes to this section. Changes will become effective on the 30th day, and will apply prospectively only to any claims arising after the 30th day.18. Applicable lawThe U.S. Federal Arbitration Act (including its procedural provisions) is the law that will be applied to determine whether Section 17 can be enforced and how it should be interpreted.Apart from that, if you are a United States resident, these Terms and our relationship will be governed by Californian law, except for its conflicts of laws principles.19. Venue for legal disputes not subject to arbitrationIf you are a United States resident, judicial proceedings that are excluded from the Arbitration Agreement in Section 17 must be brought in state or federal court in San Francisco, California, unless we both agree to some other location.

If you disable or refuse cookies, please note that some parts of this website may become inaccessible or not function properly. For more information about the cookies we use, please see our Cookies Policy.\nWe require all third parties to respect the security of your personal data and to treat it in accordance with the law. We do not allow our third-party service providers to use your personal data for their own purposes and only permit them to process your personal data for specified purposes and in accordance with our instructions.\nSome of our external third parties are based outside the European Economic Area (EEA) so their processing of your personal data will involve a transfer of data outside the EEA. Whenever we transfer your personal data out of the EEA, we ensure a similar degree of protection is afforded to it by ensuring at least one of the following safeguards is implemented:\nWe will only transfer your personal data to countries that have been deemed to provide an adequate level of protection for personal data by the European Commission. For further details, see European Commission: Adequacy of the protection of personal data in non-EU countries.\nWhere we use providers based in the US, we may transfer data to them if they are part of the Privacy Shield which requires them to provide similar protection to personal data shared between the Europe and the US. For further details, see European Commission: EU-US Privacy Shield.\nWe have put in place appropriate security measures to prevent your personal data from being accidentally lost, used or accessed in an unauthorized way, altered or disclosed. In addition, we limit access to your personal data to those employees, agents, contractors and other third parties who have a business need to know. They will only process your personal data on our instructions and they are subject to a duty of confidentiality.\nWe have put in place procedures to deal with any suspected personal data breach and will notify you and any applicable regulator of a breach where we are legally required to do so.\nWe will only retain your personal data for as long as necessary to fulfil the purposes we collected it for, including for the purposes of satisfying any legal, accounting, or reporting requirements.\nTo determine the appropriate retention period for personal data, we consider the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the personal data, the potential risk of harm from unauthorized use or disclosure of your personal data, the purposes for which we process your personal data and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and the applicable legal requirements.\nIn some circumstances you can ask us to delete your data: see \u201crequest erasure\u201d below for further information.\nIn some circumstances we may anonymize your personal data (so that it can no longer be associated with you) for research or statistical purposes in which case we may use this information indefinitely without further notice to you.\nYou may contact our data protection officer at dpo@softnews.ro for more information or to exercise any of these rights:\n1. Request access to your personal data (commonly known as a \"data subject access request\"). This enables you to receive a copy of the personal data we hold about you and to check that we are lawfully processing it.\n2. Request correction of the personal data that we hold about you. This enables you to have any incomplete or inaccurate data we hold about you corrected, though we may need to verify the accuracy of the new data you provide to us.\n3. Request erasure of your personal data. This enables you to ask us to delete or remove personal data where there is no good reason for us continuing to process it. You also have the right to ask us to delete or remove your personal data where you have successfully exercised your right to object to processing (see below), where we may have processed your information unlawfully or where we are required to erase your personal data to comply with local law. Note, however, that we may not always be able to comply with your request of erasure for specific legal reasons which will be notified to you, if applicable, at the time of your request.\n4. Object to processing of your personal data where we are relying on a legitimate interest (or those of a third party) and there is something about your particular situation which makes you want to object to processing on this ground as you feel it impacts on your fundamental rights and freedoms. You also have the right to object where we are processing your personal data for direct marketing purposes. In some cases, we may demonstrate that we have compelling legitimate grounds to process your information which override your rights and freedoms.\n5. Request restriction of processing of your personal data. This enables you to ask us to suspend the processing of your personal data in the following scenarios: (a) if you want us to establish the data's accuracy; (b) where our use of the data is unlawful but you do not want us to erase it; (c) where you need us to hold the data even if we no longer require it as you need it to establish, exercise or defend legal claims; or (d) you have objected to our use of your data but we need to verify whether we have overriding legitimate grounds to use it.\n6. Request the transfer of your personal data to you or to a third party. We will provide to you, or a third party you have chosen, your personal data in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable format. Note that this right only applies to automated information which you initially provided consent for us to use or where we used the information to perform a contract with you.\nExercising these rights\nUse our DSR (data subject request) form or send an email to dpo@softnews.ro\nYou also have the right to make a complaint at any time to the ANSPDCP, the Romanian supervisory authority for data protection issues. We would, however, appreciate the chance to deal with your concerns about data protection before you approach the authority so please contact us in the first instance.\nNo fee usually required\nYou will not have to pay a fee to access your personal data (or to exercise any of the other rights).\nWhat we may need from you\nWe may need to request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity and ensure your right to access your personal data (or to exercise any of your other rights). This is a security measure to ensure that personal data is not disclosed to any person who has no right to receive it.

To do this we need to understand your listening habits so we can deliver an exceptional and personalized service specifically for you. That said, your privacy and the security of your personal data is, and will always be, enormously important to us. So, we want to transparently explain how and why we gather, store, share and use your personal data - as well as outline the controls and choices you have around when and how you choose to share your personal data.\nThat is our objective, and this Privacy Policy (\u201cPolicy\u201d) will explain exactly what we mean in further detail below.\nThis Policy sets out the essential details relating to your personal data relationship with Spotify. The Policy applies to all Spotify services and any associated services (referred to as the \u2018Spotify Service\u2019). The terms governing your use of the Spotify Service are defined in our Terms and Conditions of Use (the \u201cTerms and Conditions of Use\u201d).\nFrom time to time, we may develop new or offer additional services. If the introduction of these new or additional services results in any change to the way we collect or process your personal data we will provide you with more information and additional terms or policies. Unless stated otherwise when we introduce these new or additional services, they will be subject to this Policy.\nThe aim of this Policy is to:\n---Ensure that you understand what personal data we collect about you, the reasons why we collect and use it, and who we share it with;\n---Explain the way we use the personal data that you share with us in order to give you a great experience when you are using the Spotify Service; and\n---Explain your rights and choices in relation to the personal data we collect and process about you and how we will protect your privacy.\nWe hope this helps you to understand our privacy commitments to you. For further clarification of the terms used in this Policy please visit our Privacy Center on spotify.com. For information on how to contact us if you ever have any questions or concerns, please see the \u2018How to Contact Us\u2019 Section 14 below. Alternatively, if you do not agree with the content of this Policy, then please remember it is your choice whether you want to use the Spotify Service.\nYou may be aware that a new European Union law, called the General Data Protection Regulation or \"GDPR\" gives certain rights to individuals in relation to their personal data.  Accordingly, we have implemented additional transparency and access controls in our Privacy Center and Privacy Settings to help users take advantage of those rights.  As available and except as limited under applicable law, the rights afforded to individuals are:\n---Right of Access - the right to be informed of and request access to the personal data we process about you;\n---Right to Rectification - the right to request that we amend or update your personal data where it is inaccurate or incomplete;\n---Right to Erasure - the right to request that we delete your personal data;\n---Right to Restrict - the right to request that we temporarily or permanently stop processing all or some of your personal data;\n---Right to Object -\nthe right, at any time, to object to us processing your personal data on grounds relating to your particular situation;\nthe right to object to your personal data being processed for direct marketing purposes;\n---Right to Data Portability - the right to request a copy of your personal data in electronic format and the right to transmit that personal data for use in another party\u2019s service; and\n---Right not to be subject to Automated Decision-making - the right to not be subject to a decision based solely on automated decision making, including profiling, where the decision would have a legal effect on you or produce a similarly significant effect.\nIn order to enable you to exercise these rights with ease and to record your preferences in relation to how Spotify uses your personal data, we provide you with access to the following settings via your Account Settings page:\n---Privacy Settings - allows you to control some of the categories of personal data we process about you, enables you to access your personal data via a \u2018Download my Data\u2019 button, and includes a link to the Privacy Center on spotify.com where you can find out more information about how Spotify uses your personal data and what your rights are; and,\n---Notification Settings - allows you to choose which communications you receive from Spotify, manage your publicly available personal data, and set your sharing preferences.\nThe Privacy Center puts you in control of how Spotify processes your personal data. It provides you with information about what happens if you adjust your settings on your Account Settings page and how to opt out of receiving certain messages from Spotify. If we send you electronic marketing messages based on your consent or as otherwise permitted by applicable law, you may, at any time, respectively withdraw such consent or declare your objection (\u201copt-out\u201d) at no cost. The electronic marketing messages you receive from Spotify (e.g. those sent via email) also will include an opt-out mechanism within the message itself (e.g. an unsubscribe link in the emails we send to you).\nYou can find out more about the GDPR rights described above and the controls we provide to all Spotify users with respect to these rights in the \u2018Your Rights\u2019 section contained in the Privacy Center. If you have any questions about your privacy, your rights, or how to exercise them, please contact our Data Protection Officer using the \u2018Contact Us\u2019 form on the Privacy Center.

Please read their privacy policies to find out how they collect and process your personal data.\nWe are committed to protecting our users\u2019 personal data. We implement appropriate technical and organisational measures to help protect the security of your personal data; however, please note that no system is ever completely secure.

This may require us to delete the Spotify account for that child.\nWe may occasionally make changes to this Policy.\nWhen we make material changes to this Policy, we\u2019ll provide you with prominent notice as appropriate under the circumstances, e.g., by displaying a prominent notice within the Spotify Service or by sending you an email.

The Spotify Service that does not require payment is currently referred to as the \u201cFree Service.\u201d  Other options require payment before you can access them (the \u201cPaid Subscriptions\u201d).  We may also offer special promotional plans, memberships, or services, including offerings of third-party products and services in conjunction with or through the Spotify Service. We are not responsible for the products and services provided by such third parties. We reserve the right to modify, terminate or otherwise amend our offered subscription plans and promotional offerings at any time in accordance with these Terms.\nThe Unlimited Service may not be available to all users.

Note that the Unlimited Service may be discontinued in the future, in which case you will no longer be charged for the Service.\nIf you have purchased or received a code, gift card, pre-paid offer or other offer provided or sold by or on behalf of Spotify for access to a Paid Subscription (\u201cCode\u201d), separate terms and conditions presented to you along with the Code may also apply to your access to the Service and you agree to comply with any such terms and conditions.

Spotify may determine your eligibility for a Trial, and withdraw or modify a Trial at any time without prior notice and with no liability, to the extent permitted under applicable law.\nFor some Trials, we\u2019ll require you to provide your payment details to start the Trial. By providing such details you agree that we may automatically begin charging you for the Paid Subscription on the first day following the end of the Trial on a recurring monthly basis or another interval that we disclose to you in advance. IF YOU DO NOT WANT THIS CHARGE, YOU MUST CANCEL THE APPLICABLE PAID SUBSCRIPTION BEFORE THE END OF THE TRIAL BY CLICKING HERE IF YOU SIGNED UP FOR THE TRIAL THROUGH SPOTIFY, OR IF YOU RECEIVED YOUR TRIAL THROUGH A THIRD PARTY, YOU MUST CANCEL THE APPLICABLE PAID SUBSCRIPTION THROUGH THE THIRD PARTY.\nYou may purchase a Paid Subscription directly from Spotify or through a third party either by (1) paying a subscription fee in advance on a monthly basis or some other recurring interval disclosed to you prior to your purchase; or (2) pre-payment giving you access to the Spotify Service for a specific time period (\u201cPre-Paid Period\u201d).\nSpotify may change the price for the Paid Subscriptions, including recurring subscription fees, the Pre-Paid Period (for periods not yet paid), or Codes, from time to time and will communicate any price changes to you in advance and, if applicable, how to accept those changes. Price changes will take effect at the start of the next subscription period following the date of the price change. Subject to applicable law, you accept the new price by continuing to use the Spotify Service after the price change takes effect. If you do not agree with a price change, you have the right to reject the change by unsubscribing from the Paid Subscription prior to the price change going into effect.\nUnless your Paid Subscription has been purchased for a Pre-Paid Period, your payment to Spotify or the third party through which you purchased the Paid Subscription will automatically renew at the end of the applicable subscription period, unless you cancel your Paid Subscription before the end of the then-current subscription period by clicking here if you purchased the Paid Subscription through Spotify, or if you purchased the Paid Subscription through a third party, by canceling the Paid Subscription through such third party. The cancellation will take effect the day after the last day of the current subscription period, and you will be downgraded to the Free Service. We do not provide refunds or credits for any partial subscription periods.\nIf you have purchased a Paid Subscription using a Code, your subscription will automatically terminate at the end of the period stated in the Code, or when there is an insufficient pre-paid balance to pay for the Service. If you have purchased your Paid Subscription through a third party, you must cancel directly with that third party.\nThe Spotify Service and the Content are the property of Spotify or Spotify's licensors.

Furthermore, the rights to terminate, rescind, or agree to any variation, waiver, or settlement of the Agreements are not subject to the consent of any other person.\nIf you have downloaded the App from the Apple, Inc. (\u201cApple\u201d) App Store or if you are using the App on an iOS device, you acknowledge that you have read, understood, and agree to the following notice regarding Apple. This Agreement is between you and Spotify only, not with Apple, and Apple is not responsible for the Service and the content thereof.

That could include, for example, access to the Spotify Service as a result of a gift card, free or discounted Trials, or together with other services. When you are presented with an offer for such aspects of your use, you will be presented with any related additional agreement, and you may have an opportunity to agree to additional terms. Some of those additional terms are listed on Spotify\u2019s website. To the extent that there is any irreconcilable conflict between any additional terms and these Terms, the additional terms shall prevail.\nUnless as otherwise stated in the Agreements, should any provision of the Agreements be held invalid or unenforceable for any reason or to any extent, such invalidity or enforceability shall not in any manner affect or render invalid or unenforceable the remaining provisions of the Agreements, and the application of that provision shall be enforced to the extent permitted by law.\nAny failure by Spotify or any third party beneficiary to enforce the Agreements or any provision thereof shall not waive Spotify\u2019s or the applicable third party beneficiary\u2019s right to do so.\nAs used in these Terms, the words \u201cinclude\u201d and \u201cincluding,\u201d and variations thereof, will be deemed to be followed by the words \u201cwithout limitation.\u201d\nSpotify may assign the Agreements, and any of its rights under the Agreements, in whole or in part, and Spotify may delegate any of its obligations under the Agreements. You may not assign the Agreements, in whole or in part, nor transfer or sub-license your rights under the Agreements, to any third party.\nYou agree to indemnify and hold Spotify harmless from and against all damages, losses, and expenses of any kind (including reasonable attorney fees and costs) arising out of or related to: (1) your breach of the Agreements or any one of them; (2) any User Content you post or otherwise contribute; (3) any activity in which you engage on or through the Spotify Service; and (4) your violation of any law or the rights of a third party.\nThe Agreements (and any non-contractual disputes/claims arising out of or in connection with them) are subject to the laws of the state of California, United States of America, without regard to choice or conflicts of law principles.\nFurther, you and Spotify agree to the jurisdiction of the Northern District of California to resolve any dispute, claim, or controversy that relates to or arises in connection with the Agreements (and any non-contractual disputes/claims relating to or arising in connection with them) and is not subject to mandatory arbitration under Section 24.2.1.\nThis Arbitration Agreement applies only to users in the United States.\n24.2.1 Dispute resolution and arbitration\nYou and Spotify agree that any dispute, claim, or controversy between you and Spotify arising in connection with or relating in any way to these Agreements or to your relationship with Spotify as a user of the Service (whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation, or any other legal theory, and whether the claims arise during or after the termination of the Agreements) will be determined by mandatory binding individual (not class) arbitration. You and Spotify further agree that the arbitrator shall have the exclusive power to rule on his or her own jurisdiction, including any objections with respect to the existence, scope or validity of the Arbitration Agreement or to the arbitrability of any claim or counterclaim. Arbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in court. THERE IS NO JUDGE OR JURY IN ARBITRATION, AND COURT REVIEW OF AN ARBITRATION AWARD IS LIMITED. There may be more limited discovery than in court. The arbitrator must follow this agreement and can award the same damages and relief as a court (including attorney fees), except that the arbitrator may not award any relief, including declaratory or injunctive relief, benefiting anyone but the parties to the arbitration. This arbitration provision will survive termination of the Agreements.\nNotwithstanding the clause above (24.2.1), you and Spotify both agree that nothing in this Arbitration Agreement will be deemed to waive, preclude, or otherwise limit either of our rights, at any time, to (1) bring an individual action in a U.S. small claims court or (2) bring an individual action seeking only temporary or preliminary individualized injunctive relief in a court of law, pending a final ruling from the arbitrator. In addition, this Arbitration Agreement doesn\u2019t stop you or us from bringing issues to the attention of federal, state, or local agencies. Such agencies can, if the law allows, seek relief against us on your behalf (or vice versa).\nYOU AND SPOTIFY AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION. Unless both you and Spotify agree, no arbitrator or judge may consolidate more than one person\u2019s claims or otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding. The arbitrator may award injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party\u2019s individual claim. If a court decides that applicable law precludes enforcement of any of this paragraph\u2019s limitations as to a particular claim for relief, then that claim (and only that claim) must be severed from the arbitration and may be brought in court.\n24.2.4 Arbitration rules\nEither you or we may start arbitration proceedings. Any arbitration between you and Spotify will take place under the Consumer Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association (\u201cAAA\u201d) then in force (the \u201cAAA Rules\u201d), as modified by this Arbitration Agreement. You and Spotify agree that the Federal Arbitration Act applies and governs the interpretation and enforcement of this provision (despite the choice of law provision above). The AAA Rules, as well as instructions on how to file an arbitration proceeding with the AAA, appear at adr.org, or you may call the AAA at 1-800-778-7879. Spotify can also help put you in touch with the AAA.\nAny arbitration hearings will take place in the county (or parish) of your billing address, provided that if the claim is for $25,000 or less, you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted (1) solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator; (2) through a non-appearance based telephonic hearing; or (3) by an in-person hearing as established by the AAA Rules in the county (or parish) of your billing address.\nIf you choose to file an arbitration proceeding and you are required to pay a filing fee, Spotify will reimburse you for that filing fee, unless your claim is for greater than US $10,000, in which case you will be responsible for the filing fee. Spotify will pay any other arbitration fees, including your share of arbitrator compensation, unless otherwise required by AAA rules or court order. Regardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator shall issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the decision and award, if any, are based. The arbitrator may make rulings and resolve disputes as to the payment and reimbursement of fees or expenses at any time during the proceeding and upon request from either party made within 14 days of the arbitrator\u2019s ruling on the merits.\n24.2.5 Notice; Process\nA party who intends to seek arbitration must first send a written notice of the dispute to the other, by certified mail, Federal Express, UPS, or Express Mail (signature required), or in the event that we do not have a physical address on file for you, by electronic mail (\"Notice\").

Maybe your PC doesn't meet the hardware requirements; maybe you bought a game by mistake; maybe you played the title for an hour and just didn't like it.\nIt doesn't matter. Valve will, upon request via help.steampowered.com, issue a refund for any reason, if the request is made within fourteen days of purchase, and the title has been played for less than two hours. There are more details below, but even if you fall outside of the refund rules we\u2019ve described, you can ask for a refund anyway and we\u2019ll take a look.\nYou will be issued a full refund of your purchase within a week of approval. You will receive the refund in Steam Wallet funds or through the same payment method you used to make the purchase. If, for any reason, Steam is unable to issue a refund via your initial payment method, your Steam Wallet will be credited the full amount. (Some payment methods available through Steam in your country may not support refunding a purchase back to the original payment method. Click here for a full list.)\nThe Steam refund offer, within two weeks of purchase and with less than two hours of playtime, applies to games and software applications on the Steam store. Here is an overview of how refunds work with other types of purchases.\nDLC purchased from the Steam store is refundable within fourteen days of purchase, and if the underlying title has been played for less than two hours since the DLC was purchased, so long as the DLC has not been consumed, modified or transferred. Please note that in some cases, Steam will be unable to give refunds for some third party DLC (for example, if the DLC irreversibly levels up a game character). These exceptions will be clearly marked as nonrefundable on the Store page prior to purchase.\nSteam will offer refund for in-game purchases within any Valve-developed games within forty-eight hours of purchase, so long as the in-game item has not been consumed, modified or transferred. Third-party developers will have the option to enable refunds for in-game items on these terms. Steam will tell you at the time of purchase if the game developer has opted to offer refunds on the in-game item you are buying. Otherwise, in-game purchases in non-Valve games are not refundable through Steam.\nWhen you pre-purchase a title on Steam (and have paid for the title in advance), you can request a refund at any time prior to release of that title. The standard 14-day/two-hour refund period also applies, starting on the game\u2019s release date.\nYou may request a refund for Steam Wallet funds within fourteen days of purchase if they were purchased on Steam and if you have not used any of those funds.\nWithin thirty (30) days after delivery, you may request a refund for Steam hardware and accessories purchased via Steam for any reason. You must ship the hardware back to us within fourteen (14) days after requesting the refund, following the instructions we provide you. Please see the Steam Hardware Order Terms for detailed guidelines on the return and cancellation process for Steam hardware and accessories.\nYou can receive a full refund for any bundle purchased on the Steam Store, so long as none of the items in the bundle have been transferred, and if the combined usage time for all items in the bundle is less than two hours. If a bundle includes an in-game item or DLC that is not refundable, Steam will tell you if the whole bundle is refundable during check-out.\nValve cannot provide refunds for purchases made outside of Steam (for example, CD keys or Steam wallet cards purchased from third parties).\nIf you have been banned by VAC (the Valve Anti-Cheat system) on a game, you lose the right to refund that game.\nWe are unable to offer refunds for video content on Steam (e.g. movies, shorts, series, episodes, and tutorials), unless the video is in a bundle with other (non-video) refundable content.\nUnredeemed gifts may be refunded within the standard 14-day/two-hour refund period. Redeemed gifts may be refunded under the same conditions if the gift recipient initiates the refund. Funds used to purchase the gift will be returned to the original purchaser.\nFor an explanation of how the EU right of withdrawal works for Steam customers, click here.\nRefunds are designed to remove the risk from purchasing titles on Steam\u2014not as a way to get free games. If it appears to us that you are abusing refunds, we may stop offering them to you. We do not consider it abuse to request a refund on a title that was purchased just before a sale and then immediately rebuying that title for the sale price.\nYou can request a refund or get other assistance with your Steam purchases at help.steampowered.com.\nLast updated December 6, 2016\n \n \n \n", "https://store.steampowered.com/subscriber_agreement/": "\nSteam Subscriber Agreement\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tLogin\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nFeatured\nExplore\nCurators\nWishlist\nNews\nStats\nHome\nDiscussions\nWorkshop\nMarket\nBroadcasts\n\r\n\t\tSupport\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tChange language\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tView desktop website\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tInstall Steam\t\t\t\t\t\t\nlogin\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\u00a0|\u00a0\r\n\t\t\t\t\tlanguage\n\u7b80\u4f53\u4e2d\u6587 (Simplified Chinese)\n\u7e41\u9ad4\u4e2d\u6587 (Traditional Chinese)\n\u65e5\u672c\u8a9e (Japanese)\n\ud55c\uad6d\uc5b4 (Korean)\n\u0e44\u0e17\u0e22 (Thai)\n\u0411\u044a\u043b\u0433\u0430\u0440\u0441\u043a\u0438 (Bulgarian)\n\u010ce\u0161tina (Czech)\nDansk (Danish)\nDeutsch (German)\nEspa\u00f1ol - Espa\u00f1a (Spanish - Spain)\nEspa\u00f1ol - Latinoam\u00e9rica (Spanish - Latin America)\n\u0395\u03bb\u03bb\u03b7\u03bd\u03b9\u03ba\u03ac (Greek)\nFran\u00e7ais (French)\nItaliano (Italian)\nMagyar (Hungarian)\nNederlands (Dutch)\nNorsk (Norwegian)\nPolski (Polish)\nPortugu\u00eas (Portuguese)\nPortugu\u00eas - Brasil (Portuguese - Brazil)\nRom\u00e2n\u0103 (Romanian)\n\u0420\u0443\u0441\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439 (Russian)\nSuomi (Finnish)\nSvenska (Swedish)\nT\u00fcrk\u00e7e (Turkish)\nTi\u1ebfng Vi\u1ec7t (Vietnamese)\n\u0423\u043a\u0440\u0430\u0457\u043d\u0441\u044c\u043a\u0430 (Ukrainian)\nHelp us translate Steam\nHome\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\tSteam Subscriber Agreement\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\ufeff\nTable of contents:\r\n\t\t\n---Registration as a subscriber; application of terms to you; your account\n---Licences\n---Billing, payment and other subscriptions\n---Online conduct, cheating and illegal behavior\n---Third party content\n---User generated content\n---Disclaimers; limitation of liability; no guarantees; limited warranty\n---Amendments to this agreement\n---Term and termination\n---Applicable law/mediation/jurisdiction\n---Dispute resolution/binding arbitration/class action waiver\n---Miscellaneous\nThis Steam Subscriber Agreement (\"Agreement\") is a legal document that explains your rights and obligations as a subscriber of Steam from Valve Corporation, a corporation under the laws of the State of Washington, with its registered office at 10400 NE 4th St., Bellevue, WA 98004, United States, registered with the Washington Secretary of State under number 60 22 90 773, VAT ID No. EU 8260 00671 (\u201cValve\u201d). Please read it carefully.\nSECTION 11 CONTAINS A BINDING ARBITRATION AGREEMENT AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER. IT MAY AFFECT YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS. PLEASE READ IT. IF YOU ARE A CUSTOMER WITH RESIDENCE IN THE EUROPEAN UNION, SECTION 11 DOES NOT APPLY TO YOU.\n1. REGISTRATION AS A SUBSCRIBER; APPLICATION OF TERMS TO YOU; YOUR ACCOUNT  \u23f6\nSteam is an online service offered by Valve.\nYou become a subscriber of Steam (\"Subscriber\") by completing the registration of a Steam user account.  This Agreement takes effect as soon as you indicate your acceptance of these terms.  You may not become a subscriber if you are under the age of 13.  Steam is not intended for children under 13 and Valve will not knowingly collect personal information from children under the age of 13.\nA. Contracting Party\nFor any interaction with Steam your contractual relationship is with Valve. Except as otherwise indicated at the time of the transaction (such as in the case of purchases from another Subscriber in a Subscription Marketplace), any transactions for Subscriptions (as defined below) you make on Steam are being made from Valve.\nB. Subscriptions; Content and Services\nAs a Subscriber you may obtain access to certain services, software and content available to Subscribers.  The Steam client software and any other software, content, and updates you download or access via Steam, including but not limited to Valve or third-party video games and in-game content, and any virtual items you trade, sell or purchase in a Steam Subscription Marketplace are referred to in this Agreement as \u201cContent and Services\u201d; the rights to access and/or use any Contents and Services accessible through Steam are referred to in this Agreement as \"Subscriptions.\"  \nEach Subscription allows you to access particular Content and Services.  Some Subscriptions may impose additional terms specific to that Subscription (\"Subscription Terms\") (for example, an end user license agreement specific to a particular game, or terms of use specific to a particular product or feature of Steam).  Also, additional terms (for example, payment and billing procedures) may be posted on http://www.steampowered.com or within the Steam service (\"Rules of Use\"). Rules of Use include the Steam Online Conduct Rules http://steampowered.com/index.php?area=online_conduct and the Steam Refund Policy http://store.steampowered.com/steam_refunds.  The Subscription Terms, the Rules of Use, and the Valve Privacy Policy (which can be found at http://www.valvesoftware.com/privacy.htm) are binding on you once you indicate your acceptance of them or of this Agreement, or otherwise become bound by them as described in Section 8 (Amendments to this Agreement).\nC. Your Account\nWhen you complete Steam\u2019s registration process, you create a Steam account (\"Account\"). Your Account may also include billing information you provide to Valve for the purchase of Subscriptions, Content and Services and any physical merchandise offered for purchase through Steam (\u201cHardware\u201d). You may not reveal, share or otherwise allow others to use your password or Account except as otherwise specifically authorized by Valve. You are responsible for the confidentiality of your login and password and for the security of your computer system. Valve is not responsible for the use of your password and Account or for all of the communication and activity on Steam that results from use of your login name and password by you, by any person to whom you may have intentionally or by negligence disclosed your login and/or password in violation of this confidentiality provision. Unless it results from Valve\u2019s negligence or fault, Valve is not responsible for the use of your Account by a person who fraudulently used your login and password without your permission. If you believe that the confidentiality of your login and/or password may have been compromised, you must notify Valve via the support form (https://support.steampowered.com/newticket.php) without any delay.\nYour Account, including any information pertaining to it (e.g.: contact information, billing information, Account history and Subscriptions, etc.), is strictly personal. You may therefore not sell or charge others for the right to use your Account, or otherwise transfer your Account, nor may you sell, charge others for the right to use, or transfer any Subscriptions other than if and as expressly permitted by this Agreement (including any Subscription Terms or Rules of Use) or as otherwise specifically permitted by Valve.\nD. Payment Processing\nPayment processing related to Content and Services and/or physical goods purchased on Steam is performed by either Valve Corporation directly or by Valve\u2019s fully owned subsidiary Valve GmbH on behalf of Valve Corporation depending on the type of payment method used.  If your card was issued outside the United States, your payment may be processed via a European acquirer by Valve GmbH on behalf of Valve Corporation. For any other type of purchases, payment will be collected by Valve Corporation directly. In any case, delivery of Content and Services as well as physical goods is performed by Valve Corporation.\n2. LICENSES  \u23f6\nA. General Content and Services License\nSteam and your Subscription(s) require the automatic download and installation of Content and Services onto your computer.  Valve hereby grants, and you accept, a non-exclusive license and right, to use the Content and Services for your personal, non-commercial use (except where commercial use is expressly allowed herein or in the applicable Subscription Terms). This license ends upon termination of (a) this Agreement or (b) a Subscription that includes the license.  The Content and Services are licensed, not sold. Your license confers no title or ownership in the Content and Services.  To make use of the Content and Services, you must have a Steam Account and you may be required to be running the Steam client and maintaining a connection to the Internet.  \nFor reasons that include, without limitation, system security, stability, and multiplayer interoperability, Steam may need to automatically update, pre-load, create new versions of or otherwise enhance the Content and Services and accordingly, the system requirements to use the Content and Services may change over time. You consent to such automatic updating.  You understand that this Agreement (including applicable Subscription Terms) does not entitle you to future updates, new versions or other enhancements of the Content and Services associated with a particular Subscription, although Valve may choose to provide such updates, etc. in its sole discretion.\nB. Beta Software License\nValve may from time to time make software accessible to you via Steam prior to the general commercial release of such software (\"Beta Software\"). You are not required to use Beta Software, but if Valve offers it, you may elect to use it under the following terms. Beta Software will be deemed to consist of Content and Services, and each item of Beta Software provided will be deemed a Subscription for such Beta Software, with the following provisions specific to Beta Software:\n---Your right to use the Beta Software may be limited in time, and may be subject to additional Subscription Terms;\nValve or any Valve affiliate may request or require that you provide suggestions, feedback, or data regarding your use of the Beta Software, which will be deemed User Generated Content under Section 6 (User Generated Content) below; and\nIn addition to the waivers and limitations of liability for all Software under Section 7 (Disclaimers; Limitations on Liability; No Guarantees; Limited Warranty) below as applicable, you specifically acknowledge that Beta Software is only released for testing and improvement purposes, in particular to provide Valve with feedback on the quality and usability of said Beta Software, and therefore contains errors, is not final and may create incompatibilities or damage to your computer, data, and/or software. If you decide to install and/or use Beta Software, you shall only use it in compliance with its purposes, i.e. for testing and improvement purposes and in any case not on a system or for purposes where the malfunction of the Beta Software can cause any kind of damage. In particular, maintain full backups of any system that you choose to install Beta Software on.\r\n\t\t\nC. License to Use Valve Developer Tools\nYour Subscription(s) may include access to various Valve tools that can be used to create content (\"Developer Tools\").  Some examples include:  the Valve software development kit (the \"SDK\") for a version of the computer game engine known as \"Source\" (the \"Source Engine\") and the associated Valve Hammer editor, The Source\u00ae Filmmaker Software, or in-game tools through which you can edit or create derivative works of a Valve game.  Particular Developer Tools (for example, The Source\u00ae Filmmaker Software) may be distributed with separate Subscription Terms that are different from the rules set forth in this Section.  Otherwise, you may use the Developer Tools, and you may use, reproduce, publish, perform, display and distribute any content you create using the Developer Tools, however you wish, but solely on a non-commercial basis.\nIf you would like to use the Source Engine SDK or other Valve Developer Tools for commercial use, please contact Valve at sourceengine@valvesoftware.com.\nD. License to Use Valve Game Content in Fan Art.\nValve appreciates the community of Subscribers that creates fan art, fan fiction, and audio-visual works that reference Valve games (\"Fan Art\").  You may incorporate content from Valve games into your Fan Art.  Except as otherwise set forth in this Section or in any Subscription Terms, you may use, reproduce, publish, perform, display and distribute Fan Art that incorporates content from Valve games however you wish, but solely on a non-commercial basis.\nIf you incorporate any third-party content in any Fan Art, you must be sure to obtain all necessary rights from the owner of that content.\nCommercial use of some Valve game content is permitted via features such as Steam Workshop or a Steam Subscription Marketplace.  Terms applicable to that use are set forth in Section 3.D. and 6.B. below and in any Subscription Terms provided for those features.\nTo view the Valve video policy containing additional terms covering the use of audio-visual works incorporating Valve intellectual property or created with The Source\u00ae Filmmaker Software, please click here: http://www.valvesoftware.com/videopolicy.html\nE. License to Use Valve Dedicated Server Software \nYour Subscription(s) may contain access to the Valve Dedicated Server Software. If so, you may use the Valve Dedicated Server Software on an unlimited number of computers for the purpose of hosting online multiplayer games of Valve products. If you wish to operate the Valve Dedicated Server Software, you will be solely responsible for procuring any Internet access, bandwidth, or hardware for such activities and will bear all costs associated therewith.\nF. Ownership of Content and Services\nAll title, ownership rights and intellectual property rights in and to the Content and Services and any and all copies thereof, are owned by Valve and/or its or its affiliates\u2019 licensors. All rights are reserved, except as expressly stated herein. The Content and Services is protected by copyright laws, international copyright treaties and conventions and other laws. The Content and Services contains certain licensed materials and Valve\u2019s and its affiliates\u2019 licensors may protect their rights in the event of any violation of this Agreement.\nG. Restrictions on Use of Content and Services\nYou may not use the Content and Services for any purpose other than the permitted access to Steam and your Subscriptions, and to make personal, non-commercial use of your Subscriptions, except as otherwise permitted by this Agreement or applicable Subscription Terms.  Except as otherwise permitted under this Agreement (including any Subscription Terms or Rules of Use), or under applicable law notwithstanding these restrictions, you may not, in whole or in part, copy, photocopy, reproduce, publish, distribute, translate, reverse engineer, derive source code from, modify, disassemble, decompile, create derivative works based on, or remove any proprietary notices or labels from the Content and Services or any software accessed via Steam without the prior consent, in writing, of Valve.\nYou are entitled to use the Content and Services for your own personal use, but you are not entitled to: (i) sell, grant a security interest in or transfer reproductions of the Content and Services to other parties in any way, nor to rent, lease or license the Content and Services to others without the prior written consent of Valve, except to the extent expressly permitted elsewhere in this Agreement (including any Subscription Terms or Rules of Use); (ii) host or provide matchmaking services for the Content and Services or emulate or redirect the communication protocols used by Valve in any network feature of the Content and Services, through protocol emulation, tunneling, modifying or adding components to the Content and Services, use of a utility program or any other techniques now known or hereafter developed, for any purpose including, but not limited to network play over the Internet, network play utilizing commercial or non-commercial gaming networks or as part of content aggregation networks, websites or services, without the prior written consent of Valve; or (iii) exploit the Content and Services or any of its parts for any commercial purpose, except as expressly permitted elsewhere in this Agreement (including any Subscription Terms or Rules of Use). \n3. BILLING, PAYMENT AND OTHER SUBSCRIPTIONS  \u23f6\nAll charges incurred on Steam, and all purchases made with the Steam Wallet, are payable in advance and final, except as described in Sections 3.I and 7 below.\nA. Payment Authorization\nWhen you provide payment information to Valve or to one of its payment processors, you represent to Valve that you are the authorized user of the card, PIN, key or account associated with that payment, and you authorize Valve to charge your credit card or to process your payment with the chosen third-party payment processor for any Subscription, Steam Wallet funds, Hardware or other fees incurred by you. Valve may require you to provide your address or other information in order to meet their obligations under applicable tax law.  \nFor Subscriptions purchased based on an agreed usage period, where recurring payments are made in exchange for continued use (\u201cRecurring Payment Subscriptions\u201d), by continuing to use the Recurring Payment Subscription you agree and reaffirm that Valve is authorized to charge your credit card (or your Steam Wallet, if funded), or to process your payment with any other applicable third-party payment processor, for any applicable recurring payment amounts. If you have purchased any Recurring Payment Subscriptions, you agree to notify Valve promptly of any changes to your credit card account number, its expiration date and/or your billing address, or your PayPal or other payment account number, and you agree to notify Valve promptly if your credit card or PayPal or other payment account expires or is cancelled for any reason.\nIf your use of Steam is subject to any type of use or sales tax, then Valve may also charge you for those taxes, in addition to the Subscription or other fees published in the Rules of Use. The European Union VAT (\u201cVAT\u201d) tax amounts collected by Valve reflect VAT due on the value of any Content and Services, Hardware or Subscription.\nYou agree that you will not use IP proxying or other methods to disguise the place of your residence, whether to circumvent geographical restrictions on game content, to purchase at pricing not applicable to your geography, or for any other purpose.  If you do this, Valve may terminate your access to your Account.\nB. Responsibility for Charges Associated With Your Account\nAs the Account holder, you are responsible for all charges incurred, including applicable taxes, and all purchases made by you or anyone that uses your Account, including your family or friends. If you cancel your Account, Valve reserves the right to collect fees, surcharges or costs incurred before cancellation. Any delinquent or unpaid Accounts must be settled before Valve will allow you to register again.\nC. Steam Wallet\nSteam may make available an account balance associated with your Account (the \u201cSteam Wallet\u201d).  The Steam Wallet is neither a bank account nor any kind of payment instrument. It functions as a prepaid balance to purchase Content and Services. You may place funds in your Steam Wallet up to a maximum amount determined by Valve, by credit card, prepaid card, promotional code, or any other payment method accepted by Steam.  Within any twenty-four (24) hour period, the total amount stored in your Steam Wallet plus the total amount spent out of your Steam Wallet, in the aggregate, may not exceed US$2,000 or its equivalent in your applicable local currency -- attempted deposits into your Steam Wallet that exceed this threshold may not be credited to your Steam Wallet until your activity falls below this threshold. Valve may change or impose different Steam Wallet balance and usage limits from time to time.\nYou will be notified by e-mail of any change to the Steam Wallet balance and usage limits within sixty (60) days before the entry into force of the said change. Your continued use of your Steam Account more than thirty (30) days after the entry into force of the changes, will constitute your acceptance of the changes. If you don\u2019t agree to the changes, your only remedy is to terminate your Steam Account or to cease use of your Steam Wallet. Valve shall not have any obligation to refund any credits remaining on your Steam Wallet in this case.\nYou may use Steam Wallet funds to purchase Subscriptions, including by making in-game purchases where Steam Wallet transactions are enabled, and Hardware. Funds added to the Steam Wallet are non-refundable and non-transferable. Steam Wallet funds do not constitute a personal property right, have no value outside Steam and can only be used to purchase Subscriptions and related content via Steam (including but not limited to games and other applications offered through the Steam Store, or in a Steam Subscription Marketplace) and Hardware. Steam Wallet funds have no cash value and are not exchangeable for cash. Steam Wallet funds that are deemed unclaimed property may be turned over to the applicable authority.\nD. Trading and Sales of Subscriptions Between Subscribers\nSteam may include  one or more features or sites that allow Subscribers to trade, sell or purchase certain types of Subscriptions (for example, license rights to virtual items) with, to or from other Subscribers (\u201cSubscription Marketplaces\u201d). An example of a Subscription Marketplace is the Steam Community Market. By using or participating in Subscription Marketplaces, you authorize Valve, on its own behalf or as an agent or licensee of any third-party creator or publisher of the applicable Subscriptions in your Account, to transfer those Subscriptions from your Account in order to give effect to any trade or sale you make.\nValve may charge a fee for trades or sales in a Subscription Marketplace.  Any fees will be disclosed to you prior to the completion of the trade or sale.\nIf you complete a trade, sale or purchase in a Subscription Marketplace, you acknowledge and agree that you are responsible for taxes, if any, which may be due with respect to your transactions, including sales or use taxes, and for compliance with applicable tax laws.  Proceeds from sales you make in a Subscription Marketplace may be considered income to you for income tax purposes.  You should consult with a tax specialist to determine your tax liability in connection with your activities in any Subscription Marketplace.\nYou understand and acknowledge that Valve may decide to cease operation of any Subscription Marketplace, change the fees that it charges or change the terms or features of the Steam Subscription Marketplace. Valve shall have no liability to you because of any inability to trade Subscriptions in the Steam Trading Marketplace, including because of discontinuation or changes in the terms, features or eligibility requirements of any Subscription Marketplace.\nYou also understand and acknowledge that Subscriptions traded, sold or purchased in any Subscription Marketplace are license rights, that you have no ownership interest in such Subscriptions, and that Valve does not recognize any transfers of Subscriptions (including transfers by operation of law) that are made outside of Steam.\nE. Retail Purchase\nValve may offer or require a Subscription for purchasers of retail packaged product versions or OEM versions of Valve products. The \"CD-Key\" or \"Product Key\" accompanying such versions is used to activate your Subscription.\nF. Steam Authorized Resellers\nYou may purchase a Subscription through an authorized reseller of Valve. The \"Product Key\" accompanying such purchase will be used to activate your Subscription. If you purchase a Subscription from an authorized reseller of Valve, you agree to direct all questions regarding the Product Key to that reseller.\nG. Free Subscriptions\nIn some cases, Valve may offer a free Subscription to certain services, software and content. As with all Subscriptions, you are always responsible for any Internet service provider, telephone, and other connection fees that you may incur when using Steam, even when Valve offers a free Subscription.\nH. Third Party Sites\nSteam may provide links to other third party sites. Some of these sites may charge separate fees, which are not included in and are in addition to any Subscription or other fees that you may pay to Valve. Steam may also provide access to third-party vendors, who provide content, goods and/or services on Steam or the Internet. Any separate charges or obligations you incur in your dealings with these third parties are your responsibility. Valve makes no representations or warranties, either express or implied, regarding any third party site. In particular, Valve makes no representation or warranty that any service or subscription offered via third-party vendors will not change or be suspended or terminated.\nI. Refunds and Right of Withdrawal\nWithout prejudice to any statutory rights you may have, you can request a refund for your purchases on Steam in accordance with the terms of Valve\u2019s Refund Policy http://store.steampowered.com/steam_refunds/.\nFor European Union consumers:\nEU law provides a statutory right to withdraw from certain contracts for physical merchandise and for the purchase of digital content. You can find more information about the extent of your statutory right to withdraw and the ways you can exercise it on this page: https://support.steampowered.com/kb_article.php?ref=8620-QYAL-4516.\n4. ONLINE CONDUCT, CHEATING AND ILLEGAL BEHAVIOR  \u23f6\nYour online conduct and interaction with other Subscribers should be guided by common sense and basic etiquette. They must notably comply with the Steam Online Conduct rules, to be found at http://steampowered.com/index.php?area=online_conduct\". Depending on terms of use imposed by third parties who host particular games or other services, additional requirements may also be provided in the Subscription Terms applicable to a particular Subscription.\nSteam and the Content and Services may include functionality designed to identify software or hardware processes or functionality that may give a player an unfair competitive advantage when playing multiplayer versions of any Content and Services or modifications of Content and Services (\u201cCheats\u201d). You agree that you will not create Cheats or assist third parties in any way to create or use Cheats. You agree that you will not directly or indirectly disable, circumvent, or otherwise interfere with the operation of software designed to prevent or report the use of Cheats. You acknowledge and agree that either Valve or any online multiplayer host may refuse to allow you to participate in certain online multiplayer games if you use Cheats in connection with Steam or the Content and Services. Further, you acknowledge and agree that an online multiplayer host may report your use of Cheats to Valve, and Valve may communicate your history of use of Cheats to other online multiplayer hosts. Valve may terminate your Account or a particular Subscription for any conduct or activity that is illegal, constitutes a Cheat, or otherwise negatively affects the enjoyment of Steam by other Subscribers. You acknowledge that Valve is not required to provide you notice before terminating your Subscription(s) and/or Account.\nYou may not use Cheats, automation software (bots), mods, hacks, or any other unauthorized third-party software, to modify or automate any Subscription Marketplace process.\n5. THIRD PARTY CONTENT  \u23f6\nIn regard to all Subscriptions, Contents and Services that are not authored by Valve, Valve does not screen such third party content available on Steam or through other sources. Valve assumes no responsibility or liability for such third party content.  Some third party application software is capable of being used by businesses for business purposes - however, you may only acquire such software via Steam for private personal use.\n6. USER GENERATED CONTENT  \u23f6\nA. General Provisions \nSteam provides interfaces and tools for you to be able to generate content and make it available to other users and/or to Valve at your sole discretion. \"User Generated Content\" means any content you make available to other users through your use of multi-user features of Steam, or to Valve or its affiliates through your use of the Content and Services or otherwise.\nWhen you upload your content to Steam to make it available to other users and/or to Valve, you grant Valve and its affiliates the worldwide, non-exclusive, right to use, reproduce, modify, create derivative works from, distribute, transmit, transcode, translate, broadcast, and otherwise communicate, and publicly display and publicly perform, your User Generated Content, and derivative works of your User Generated Content, for the purpose of the operation, distribution and promotion of the Steam service, Steam games or other Steam offerings. This license is granted to Valve as the content is uploaded on Steam for the entire duration of the intellectual property rights. It may be terminated if Valve is in breach of the license and has not cured such breach within fourteen (14) days from receiving notice from you sent to the attention of the Valve Legal Department at the applicable Valve address noted on this Privacy Policy page. The termination of said license does not affect the rights of any sub-licensees pursuant to any sub-license granted by Valve prior to termination of the license. Valve is the sole owner of the derivative works created by Valve from your Content, and is therefore entitled to grant licenses on these derivative works.  If you use Valve cloud storage, you grant us a license to store your information as part of that service.  Valve may place limits on the amount of storage you may use.\nIf you provide Valve with any feedback or suggestions about Steam, the Content and Services, or any Valve products or services, Valve is free to use the feedback or suggestions however it chooses, without any obligation to account to you.\nB. Content Uploaded to the Steam Workshop\nSome games or applications available on Steam (\"Workshop-Enabled Apps\") allow you to create User Generated Content based on or using the Workshop-Enabled App, and to submit that User Generated Content (a \u201cWorkshop Contribution\u201d) to one or more Steam Workshop web pages.  Workshop Contributions can be viewed by the Steam community,  and for some categories of Workshop Contributions users may be able to interact with, download or purchase the Workshop Contribution.  In some cases, Workshop Contributions may be considered for incorporation by Valve or a third-party developer into a game or into a Subscription Marketplace.\nYou understand and agree that Valve is not obligated to use, distribute, or continue to distribute copies of any Workshop Contribution and reserves the right, but not the obligation, to restrict or remove Workshop Contributions for any reason.\nSpecific Workshop-Enabled Apps or Workshop web pages may contain special terms (\u201cApp-Specific Terms\u201d) that supplement or change the terms set out in this Section.  In particular, where Workshop Contributions are distributed for a fee, App-Specific Terms will address how revenue may be shared.  Unless otherwise specified in App-Specific Terms (if any), the following general rules apply to Workshop Contributions.\n---Workshop Contributions are Subscriptions, and therefore you agree that any Subscriber receiving distribution of your Workshop Contribution will have the same rights to use your Workshop Contribution (and will be subject to the same restrictions) as are set out in this Agreement for any other Subscriptions.\nNotwithstanding the license described in Section 6.A., Valve will only have the right to modify or create derivative works from your Workshop Contribution in the following cases:  (a) Valve may make modifications necessary to make your Contribution compatible with Steam and the Workshop functionality or user interface, and (b) Valve or the applicable developer may make modifications to Workshop Contributions that are accepted for in-Application distribution as it deems necessary or desirable to enhance gameplay.\r\n\t\t\tYou may, in your sole discretion, choose to remove a Workshop Contribution from the applicable Workshop pages.  If you do so, Valve will no longer have the right to use, distribute, transmit, communicate, publicly display or publicly perform the Workshop Contribution, except that (a) Valve may continue to exercise these rights for any Workshop Contribution that is accepted for distribution in-game or distributed in a manner that allows it to be used in-game, and (b) your removal will not affect the rights of any Subscriber who has already obtained access to a copy of the Workshop Contribution.\r\n\t\t\nExcept where otherwise provided in App-Specific Terms, you agree that Valve\u2019s consideration of your Workshop Contribution is your full compensation, and you are not entitled to any other rights or compensation in connection with the rights granted to Valve and to other Subscribers.\nC. Promotions and Endorsements\nIf you use Steam services (e.g. the Steam Curators\u2019 Lists or the Steam Broadcasting service) to promote or endorse a product, service or event in return for any kind of consideration from a third party (including non-monetary rewards such as free games), you must clearly indicate the source of such consideration to your audience.\nD. Representations and Warranties\nYou represent and warrant to us that you have sufficient rights in all User Generated Content to grant Valve and other affected parties the licenses described under A. and B. above or in any license terms specific to the applicable Workshop-Enabled App or Workshop page. This includes, without limitation, any kind of intellectual property rights or other proprietary or personal rights affected by or included in the User Generated Content.  In particular, with respect to Workshop Contributions, you represent and warrant that the Workshop Contribution was originally created by you (or, with respect to a Workshop Contribution to which others contributed besides you, by you and the other contributors, and in such case that you have the right to submit such Workshop Contribution on behalf of those other contributors). \nYou furthermore represent and warrant that the User Generated Content, your submission of that Content, and your granting of rights in that Content does not violate any applicable contract, law or regulation.\n7. DISCLAIMERS; LIMITATION OF LIABILITY; NO GUARANTEES; LIMITED WARRANTY  \u23f6\nTHIS SECTION 7 DOES NOT APPLY TO EU SUBSCRIBERS.\r\n\t\t\n---FOR AUSTRALIAN SUBSCRIBERS, THIS SECTION 7 DOES NOT EXCLUDE, RESTRICT OR MODIFY THE APPLICATION OF ANY GUARANTEE, RIGHT OR REMEDY THAT CANNOT BE SO EXCLUDED, RESTRICTED OR MODIFIED, INCLUDING THOSE CONFERRED BY THE AUSTRALIAN CONSUMER LAW (ACL). UNDER THE ACL, GOODS COME WITH GUARANTEES INCLUDING A GUARANTEE THAT GOODS ARE OF ACCEPTABLE QUALITY.

IF THIS GUARANTEE IS NOT MET THERE ARE ENTITLEMENTS TO HAVE THE SOFTWARE REMEDIED (WHICH MAY INCLUDE REPAIR, REPLACEMENT OR REFUND). IF A REMEDY CANNOT BE PROVIDED OR THE FAILURE IS OF A SUBSTANTIAL CHARACTER, THE ACT PROVIDES FOR A REFUND.\n\r\n\tPrior to acquiring a Subscription, you should consult the product information made available on Steam, including Subscription description, minimum technical requirements, and user reviews.\nA. DISCLAIMERS\nTO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, VALVE AND ITS AFFILIATES AND SERVICE PROVIDERS EXPRESSLY DISCLAIM (I) ANY WARRANTY FOR STEAM, THE CONTENT AND SERVICES, AND THE SUBSCRIPTIONS, AND (II) ANY COMMON LAW DUTIES WITH REGARD TO STEAM, THE CONTENT AND SERVICES, AND THE SUBSCRIPTIONS, INCLUDING DUTIES OF LACK OF NEGLIGENCE AND LACK OF WORKMANLIKE EFFORT. STEAM, THE CONTENT AND SERVICES, THE SUBSCRIPTIONS, AND ANY INFORMATION AVAILABLE IN CONNECTION THEREWITH ARE PROVIDED ON AN \"AS IS\" AND \"AS AVAILABLE\" BASIS, \"WITH ALL FAULTS\" AND WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, OR NONINFRINGEMENT. ANY WARRANTY AGAINST INFRINGEMENT THAT MAY BE PROVIDED IN SECTION 2-312 OF THE UNITED STATES UNIFORM COMMERCIAL CODE AND/OR IN ANY OTHER COMPARABLE STATE STATUTE IS EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMED. ALSO, THERE IS NO WARRANTY OF TITLE, NON-INTERFERENCE WITH YOUR ENJOYMENT, OR AUTHORITY IN CONNECTION WITH STEAM, THE CONTENT AND SERVICES, THE SUBSCRIPTIONS, OR INFORMATION AVAILABLE IN CONNECTION THEREWITH.\nANY WARRANTY AGAINST INFRINGEMENT THAT MAY BE PROVIDED IN SECTION 2-312 OF THE UNITED STATES UNIFORM COMMERCIAL CODE IS EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMED.\nB. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY\nTO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, NEITHER VALVE, ITS LICENSORS, NOR THEIR AFFILIATES, NOR ANY OF VALVE\u2019S SERVICE PROVIDERS, SHALL BE LIABLE IN ANY WAY FOR LOSS OR DAMAGE OF ANY KIND RESULTING FROM THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE STEAM, YOUR ACCOUNT, YOUR SUBSCRIPTIONS AND THE CONTENT AND SERVICES INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES. IN NO EVENT WILL VALVE BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, SPECIAL, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES, OR ANY OTHER DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF OR IN ANY WAY CONNECTED WITH STEAM, THE CONTENT AND SERVICES, THE SUBSCRIPTIONS, AND ANY INFORMATION AVAILABLE IN CONNECTION THEREWITH, OR THE DELAY OR INABILITY TO USE THE CONTENT AND SERVICES, SUBSCRIPTIONS OR ANY INFORMATION, EVEN IN THE EVENT OF VALVE\u2019S OR ITS AFFILIATES\u2019 FAULT, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), STRICT LIABILITY, OR BREACH OF VALVE\u2019S WARRANTY AND EVEN IF IT HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THESE LIMITATIONS AND LIABILITY EXCLUSIONS APPLY EVEN IF ANY REMEDY FAILS TO PROVIDE ADEQUATE RECOMPENSE. \nBECAUSE SOME STATES OR JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR THE LIMITATION OF LIABILITY FOR CONSEQUENTIAL OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES, IN SUCH STATES OR JURISDICTIONS, EACH OF VALVE, ITS LICENSORS, AND ITS AFFILIATES\u2019 LIABILITY SHALL BE LIMITED TO THE FULL EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW.\nC. NO GUARANTEES\nTO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, NEITHER VALVE NOR ITS AFFILIATES GUARANTEE CONTINUOUS, ERROR-FREE, VIRUS-FREE OR SECURE OPERATION AND ACCESS TO STEAM, THE CONTENT AND SERVICES, YOUR ACCOUNT AND/OR YOUR SUBSCRIPTIONS(S) OR ANY INFORMATION AVAILABLE IN CONNECTION THEREWITH.\nD. LIMITED WARRANTY\nCERTAIN HARDWARE PURCHASED FROM VALVE IS SUBJECT TO A LIMITED WARRANTY, [OR DEPENDING ON YOUR LOCATION, A STATUTORY WARRANTY] WHICH IS DESCRIBED IN DETAIL HERE.\n8. AMENDMENTS TO THIS AGREEMENT  \u23f6\nPLEASE NOTE: If you are a consumer with place of residence in Germany, a different version of Section 8 applies to you, which is available here.\nThis Agreement may at any time be mutually amended by your explicit consent to changes proposed by Valve. Furthermore, Valve may amend this Agreement (including any Subscription Terms or Rules of Use) unilaterally at any time in its sole discretion. In this case, you will be notified by e-mail of any amendment to this Agreement made by Valve within 60 (sixty) days before the entry into force of the said amendment. You can view the Agreement at any time at http://www.steampowered.com/. Your failure to cancel your Account within thirty (30) days after the entry into force of the amendments, will constitute your acceptance of the amended terms.  If you don\u2019t agree to the amendments or to any of the terms in this Agreement, your only remedy is to cancel your Account or to cease use of the affected Subscription(s).  Valve shall not have any obligation to refund any fees that may have accrued to your Account before cancellation of your Account or cessation of use of any Subscription, nor shall Valve have any obligation to prorate any fees in such circumstances.  \n9. TERM AND TERMINATION  \u23f6\nA. Term\nThe term of this Agreement (the \"Term\") commences on the date you first indicate your acceptance of these terms, and will continue in effect until otherwise terminated in accordance with this Agreement.\nB. Termination by You\nYou may cancel your Account at any time.  You may cease use of a Subscription at any time or, if you choose, you may request that Valve terminate your access to a Subscription.  However, Subscriptions are not transferable, and even if your access to a Subscription for a particular game or application is terminated, the original activation key will not be able to be registered to any other account, even if the Subscription was obtained in a retail store.  Access to Subscriptions purchased as a part of a pack or bundle cannot be terminated individually, termination of access to one game within the bundle will result in termination of access to all games purchased in the pack.  Your cancellation of an Account, or your cessation of use of any Subscription or request that access to a Subscription be terminated, will not entitle you to any refund, including of any Subscription fees.  Valve reserves the right to collect fees, surcharges or costs incurred prior to the cancellation of your Account or termination of your access to a particular Subscription. In addition, you are responsible for any charges incurred to third-party vendors or content providers before your cancellation. \nC. Termination by Valve\nValve may cancel your Account or any particular Subscription(s) at any time in the event that (a) Valve ceases providing such Subscriptions to similarly situated Subscribers generally, or (b) you breach any terms of this Agreement (including any Subscription Terms or Rules of Use). In the event that your Account or a particular Subscription is terminated or cancelled by Valve for a violation of this Agreement or improper or illegal activity, no refund, including of any Subscription fees or of any unused funds in your Steam Wallet, will be granted.\nD. Survival of Terms\nSections 2(C), 2(D), 2(F), 2(G), 3(A), 3(B), 3(D), 3(H), and 5 - 12 will survive any expiration or termination of this Agreement.\n10. APPLICABLE LAW/MEDIATION/JURISDICTION  \u23f6\nFor All Customers Outside the European Union:\nYou agree that this Agreement shall be deemed to have been made and executed in the State of Washington, U.S.A., and any dispute arising hereunder shall be resolved in accordance with the law of Washington excluding the law of conflicts and the Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods. Subject to Section 11 (Dispute Resolution/Binding Arbitration/Class Action Waiver) below, you agree that any claim asserted in any legal proceeding by you against Valve shall be commenced and maintained exclusively in any state or federal court located in King County, Washington, having subject matter jurisdiction with respect to the dispute between the parties and you hereby consent to the exclusive jurisdiction of such courts. In any dispute arising under this Agreement, the prevailing party will be entitled to attorneys\u2019 fees and expenses.\nFor EU Customers:\nIn the event of a dispute relating to the interpretation, the performance or the validity of the Subscriber Agreement, an amicable solution will be sought before any legal action. You can file your complaint at http://help.steampowered.com. In case of failure, you may, within one year of the failed request, have recourse to an Alternative Dispute Resolution procedure by filing an online complaint on the European Commission\u2019s Online Dispute Resolution website:  https://webgate.ec.europa.eu/odr/main/index.cfm?event=main.home.chooseLanguage.\nIn the event that out-of-court dispute resolutions fail, the dispute may be brought before the competent courts.\n11. DISPUTE RESOLUTION/BINDING ARBITRATION/CLASS ACTION WAIVER  \u23f6\nThis Section 11 shall apply to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law. If the laws of your jurisdiction prohibit the application of some or all of the provisions of this Section notwithstanding Section 10 (Applicable Law/Jurisdiction), such provisions will not apply to you. IN PARTICULAR, IF YOU LIVE IN THE EUROPEAN UNION, THIS SECTION 11 DOES NOT APPLY TO YOU.\nMost user concerns can be resolved by use of our Steam support site at https://support.steampowered.com/. If Valve is unable to resolve your concerns and a dispute remains between you and Valve, this Section explains how the parties have agreed to resolve it.\nYOU AND VALVE AGREE TO RESOLVE ALL DISPUTES AND CLAIMS BETWEEN US IN INDIVIDUAL BINDING ARBITRATION. THAT INCLUDES, BUT IS NOT LIMITED TO, ANY CLAIMS ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO: (i) ANY ASPECT OF THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN US; (ii) THIS AGREEMENT; OR (iii) YOUR USE OF STEAM, YOUR ACCOUNT OR THE CONTENT AND SERVICES. IT APPLIES REGARDLESS OF WHETHER SUCH CLAIMS ARE BASED IN CONTRACT, TORT, STATUTE, FRAUD, UNFAIR COMPETITION, MISREPRESENTATION OR ANY OTHER LEGAL THEORY.\nHowever, this Section does not apply to the following types of claims or disputes, which you or Valve may bring in any court with jurisdiction: (i) claims of infringement or other misuse of intellectual property rights, including such claims seeking injunctive relief; and (ii) claims related to or arising from any alleged unauthorized use, piracy or theft.\nThis Section does not prevent you from bringing your dispute to the attention of any federal, state, or local government agencies that can, if the law allows, seek relief from us for you.\nAn arbitration is a proceeding before a neutral arbitrator, instead of before a judge or jury. Arbitration is less formal than a lawsuit in court, and provides more limited discovery. It follows different rules than court proceedings, and is subject to very limited review by courts. The arbitrator will issue a written decision and provide a statement of reasons if requested by either party. YOU UNDERSTAND THAT YOU AND VALVE ARE GIVING UP THE RIGHT TO SUE IN COURT AND TO HAVE A TRIAL BEFORE A JUDGE OR JURY.\nYou and Valve agree to make reasonable, good faith efforts to informally resolve any dispute before initiating arbitration. A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send the other a written notice that describes the nature and basis of the claim or dispute and sets forth the relief sought. If you and Valve do not reach an agreement to resolve that claim or dispute within 30 days after the notice is received, you or Valve may commence an arbitration. Written notice to Valve must be sent via postal mail to: ATTN: Arbitration Notice, Valve Corporation, P.O. Box 1688, Bellevue, WA 98004. \nThe Federal Arbitration Act applies to this Section. The arbitration will be governed by the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association (\u201cAAA\u201d) and, where applicable, the AAA\u2019s Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes, as modified by this Agreement, both of which are available at http://www.adr.org. The arbitrator is bound by the terms of this Agreement. \nThe AAA will administer the arbitration. It may be conducted through the submission of documents, by phone, or in person in the county where you live or at another mutually agreed location.  \nIf you seek $10,000 or less, Valve agrees to reimburse your filing fee and your share of the arbitration costs, including your share of arbitrator compensation, at the conclusion of the proceeding, unless the arbitrator determines your claims are frivolous or costs are unreasonable as determined by the arbitrator. Valve agrees not to seek its attorneys\u2019 fees or costs in arbitration unless the arbitrator determines your claims are frivolous or costs are unreasonable as determined by the arbitrator. If you seek more than $10,000, the arbitration costs, including arbitrator compensation, will be split between you and Valve according to the AAA Commercial Arbitration Rules and the AAA\u2019s Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes, if applicable.  \nYOU AND VALVE AGREE NOT TO BRING OR PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION, PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL ACTION OR COLLECTIVE ARBITRATION, EVEN IF AAA\u2019s PROCEDURES OR RULES WOULD OTHERWISE ALLOW ONE. THE ARBITRATOR MAY AWARD RELIEF ONLY IN FAVOR OF THE INDIVIDUAL PARTY SEEKING RELIEF AND ONLY TO THE EXTENT OF THAT PARTY\u2019S INDIVIDUAL CLAIM. You and Valve also agree not to seek to combine any action or arbitration with any other action or arbitration without the consent of all parties to this Agreement and all other actions or arbitrations.\nIf the agreement in this Section not to bring or participate in a class or representative action, private attorney general action or collective arbitration should be found illegal or unenforceable, you and Valve agree that it shall not be severable, that this entire Section shall be unenforceable and any claim or dispute would be resolved in court and not in collective arbitration. \nNotwithstanding this Section, you have the right to litigate any dispute in small claims court, if all the requirements of the small claims court, including any limitations on jurisdiction and the amount at issue in the dispute, are satisfied. \n12. MISCELLANEOUS  \u23f6\nExcept as otherwise expressly set forth in this Agreement, in the event that any provision of this Agreement shall be held by a court or other tribunal of competent jurisdiction to be unenforceable, such provision will be enforced to the maximum extent permissible and the remaining portions of this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect. This Agreement, including any Subscription Terms, Rules of Use, the Valve Privacy Policy, and the Valve Hardware Warranty Policy, constitutes and contains the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersedes any prior oral or written agreements. You agree that this Agreement is not intended to confer and does not confer any rights or remedies upon any person other than the parties to this Agreement.\nValve\u2019s obligations are subject to existing laws and legal process and Valve may comply with law enforcement or regulatory requests or requirements notwithstanding any contrary term.\nYou agree to comply with all applicable import/export laws and regulations. You agree not to export the Content and Services or Hardware or allow use of your Account by individuals of any terrorist supporting countries to which encryption exports are at the time of exportation restricted by the U.S. Bureau of Export Administration. You represent and warrant that you are not located in, under the control of, or a national or resident of any such prohibited country.\nThis Agreement was last updated on November 13th, 2018 (\"Revision Date\"). If you were a Subscriber before the Revision Date, it replaces your existing agreement with Valve or Valve SARL on the day that you explicitly accept it. If you prefer to continue using Steam and your existing Subscriptions under the version of the Agreement in effect prior to the Revision Date, you are free to do so.\n \nPrivacy Feedback\n \n \n \n"}, "travelzoo.com": {"http://www.travelzoo.com/privacy/": "\nPrivacy Policy | Travelzoo\n"}, "trello.com": {"https://trello.com/legal/dmca": "      ", "https://trello.com/legal/security": "     Operations and Security                             Trello, Inc. (\u201cwe\u201d, \u201cus\u201d or \u201cour\u201d) is SOC2 Type 1 certified\u2014we receive and review our data hosting providers\u2019 SOC1 and SOC2 reports every 6 months under NDA. Trello is PCI-DSS certified and complies with Privacy Shield.  Automated scans of Trello's production site are conducted a minimum of every 7 days. All changes are peer reviewed and vulnerability and security lists are actively monitored for CVE and other vulnerability disclosures with appropriate actions taken. We participate in an active bug bounty program on Bugcrowd and mitigate all material findings as appropriate.  Trello production services are hosted on Amazon Web Services\u2019 (\u201cAWS\u201d) EC2 platform. The physical servers are located in AWS\u2019s EC2 data centers. As of this date, AWS (i) has certifications for compliance with ISO/IEC 27001:2013, 27017:2015 and 27018:2014, (ii) is certified as a PCI DSS 3.2 Level 1 Service Provider, and (iii) undergoes SOC 1, SOC 2 and SOC 3 audits (with semi-annual reports). Additional details about AWS\u2019 compliance programs, including FedRAMP compliance, can be found at AWS\u2019 website.1 All user content is stored within US regions of AWS and Google Cloud Storage (\"GCS\"). Trello\u2019s production environment is hosted on an AWS EC2 platform. User content can also be found in Trello backups, stored in AWS EC2, S3, Glacier, and GCS. We currently do not offer customers the option of hosting Trello on a private server, or to otherwise use Trello on a separate infrastructure.  We maintain separate and distinct production, staging, and development environments for Trello. To access Trello\u2019s production environment, authorized and trained members of Trello's SRE and select Engineering team members (\u201cAuthorized Personnel\u201d) authenticate to the VPN using unique strong passwords and TOTP based 2FA and then only access the production environment via ssh terminal connections using passphrase protected personal RSA certificates. An IDS system is in place on all production servers, which includes real-time monitoring and alerting of any changes to the production system files or configuration and anomalous security events. For Authorized Personnel, any workstations running Windows or macOS must be running current and active anti-virus software. Those members are also trained not to replicate non-public user data stored in Trello\u2019s production environment onto their workstations or mobile devices. For clarity, users of Trello can access data via mobile apps.  Trello uses Akamai for DDoS protection. AWS Network ACL and Security Groups are used to restrict access to Trello\u2019s systems as appropriate to their role. Active monitoring of these security rules is in place with alerting mechanisms in place for any changes to the configuration. Public access is restricted to port 443 and 80 on the network load balancers for public traffic.  SAML 2.0 SSO is supported for Trello Enterprise customers. All customers can enable 2FA on their accounts or use Google OAuth. If SSO or OAuth is used to access Trello, Trello will inherit the login security settings in the user's IdP or Google account. If logging in directly to Trello using a username or email and password, Trello requires a minimum of 8 characters. Repeated failed login attempts trigger a 30 second lock before a user can retry. Passwords are stored in a hashed form and will never be sent via email\u2014upon account creation and password reset, Trello will send a link to the email associated with the account that will enable the user to create a new password. Password complexity and session length requirements cannot be customized within the app. However, these can be set within an IdP for an SSO-enforced team.  All user data stored in Trello is protected in accordance with our obligations in the Atlassian Cloud Terms of Service, and access to such data by Authorized Personnel is based on the principle of least privilege. Only Authorized Personnel have direct access to Trello\u2019s production systems. Those who do have direct access to production systems are only permitted to view user data stored in Trello in the aggregate, for troubleshooting purposes or as otherwise permitted in Trello\u2019s Privacy Policy. Trello maintains a list of Authorized Personnel with access to the production environment. These members undergo criminal background checks and are approved by Trello\u2019s Engineering management. Trello also maintain a list of personnel who are permitted to access Trello code, as well as the development and staging environments. These lists are reviewed quarterly and upon role change. Trained members of the Trello customer support team also have case-specific, limited access to user data stored in Trello through restricted access customer support tools. Customer support team members are not authorized to review non-public user data stored in Trello for customer support purposes without explicit permission. When a Trello user submits a support ticket, they have the option of authorizing the customer support team to view their data. The Trello customer support team will only receive such access to the account if it is granted by the user, either by selecting the \"Give Trello support staff temporary access to your account\" option when submitting a help request, or by clicking a link sent to the user's email by the Trello Support team. The account owner can revoke such access at any time.2 Upon role change or leaving the company, the production credentials of Authorized Personnel are deactivated, and their sessions are forcibly logged out. Thereafter, all such accounts are removed or changed.  User data entered on public boards or included in public profile information may be viewed or accessed by anyone. In addition, notwithstanding anything to the contrary, data may be collected, shared, retained and used as described in Trello\u2019s Privacy Policy or customer\u2019s agreement(s) with Trello.  User data may be shared by Trello with third-party service providers (a user's email address for an email delivery provider, for example) pursuant to Trello\u2019s Privacy Policy and in compliance with Trello\u2019s applicable signed service agreements.  In some instances our offices share buildings with other companies. For that reason, we require mandatory visitor check-in with the building security team and that visitors wear identification badges. Additionally, visitors must check-in with our front desk and require an escort throughout the building at all times. Employee access to physical facilities is protected by electronic badge readers and building security. CCTV covers entry and exit points 24/7 with logs made available to us internally. Trello's production services are hosted on Amazon Web Services\u2019 (\u201cAWS\u201d) EC2 platform. The physical servers are located in AWS\u2019 secure data centers.3 We require that production critical data is never to be stored by those with privileged access on physical media outside of our data hosting provider's production environments. See above for information on AWS\u2019 compliance programs.  Strict firewall rules prohibit access to necessary ports for the usage of Trello (e.g., 443), to help ensure limited access to the production environment to our VPN network and authorized systems. Our corporate network has no additional access to the production environment, with Authorized Personnel required to connect to the VPN in order to access any special systems or environments. Authorized Personnel with access to Trello\u2019s production environment are trained as noted above. In addition, employee workstations are required to time out and lock after a maximum of one minute once sleep or the screen saver begins. We do not have a clean desk policy.  Trello uses industry standard Transport Layer Security (\u201cTLS\u201d) to create a secure connection using 128-bit Advanced Encryption Standard (\u201cAES\u201d) encryption. This includes all data sent between the web, desktop, iOS, and Android apps and the Trello servers. There is no non-TLS option for connecting to Trello. All connections are made securely over HTTPS.  Data drives on servers holding user data use full disk, industry-standard AES encryption with a unique encryption key for each server. File attachments to Trello cards are stored in Amazon\u2019s S3 service. Each such attachment is assigned a unique link with an unguessable, cryptographically strong random component, and are only accessible using a secure HTTPS connection. File attachments to Trello cards uploaded after June 3, 2015 are encrypted using Amazon S3 server side 256-bit AES encryption. The encryption, key management, and decryption process is inspected and verified internally by Amazon on a regular basis as part of their existing audit process. At an Enterprise customer\u2019s request, attachments uploaded prior to June 3, 2015 can be retroactively encrypted within Amazon S3. All Trello backups are encrypted with AES encryption.  Encryption keys for Trello attachments, stored in S3, are managed by Amazon. The encryption, key management, and decryption process is inspected and verified internally by Amazon on a regular basis as part of their existing audit process. Encryption keys for Trello attachments managed by our team are rotated upon relevant changes of roles or employment status. Encryption keys managed by our team are not stored outside of Trello\u2019s production backup environment and are managed by the our SRE team. Trello backups are of the entire data set, so they are encrypted using a shared key.  Upon termination of a Trello Business Class or Enterprise contract, if requested by the Trello customer\u2019s administrator, the user content that is stored on the terminated team\u2019s boards, lists and cards will be completely removed from the live Trello production database. All file attachments uploaded directly to Trello will be removed from the live Trello production database within 30 days. The team\u2019s data will remain in encrypted Trello database backups until those backups fall out of the 90-day backup retention window and are destroyed in accordance with our data retention policy. In the event that a database restore is necessary within 90 days of a requested data deletion, we will re-delete the data as soon as reasonably possible after the live production system is fully restored. For clarity, if a customer continues to use Trello pursuant to a free account or different plan following the termination of a Business Class or Enterprise contract, such data may be retained for use in accordance with the terms and conditions applicable to such account or plan.  In the case of a Trello user account being deleted, upon deletion, Trello deletes the user\u2019s personal data, including items like name, email address and location, within 30 days of the request. After 30 days, such personal data will remain in encrypted Trello database backups until those backups fall out of the 90-day retention window and are completely destroyed. In certain cases where Trello has a legitimate business or legal purpose to do so, Trello may keep user personal data. Some examples of this include financial information related to things like purchases and billing records; records showing why the account was deleted; or data relating to a litigation or other legal inquiry. Upon deletion of an individual user account, Trello does not automatically delete the content that was created by individual users in Trello. For example, items typed into cards like a comment or an added file will remain visible even if the removed user no longer exists. The applicable team\u2019s administrators or users, depending on the permission settings, would need to delete that content manually. Users may have installed third party applications or custom applications, e.g., Power-Ups, that add features to Trello. These apps may have stored user personal data. To see a list of apps that may have stored personal data, users should navigate to their Trello Settings page (before deleting their account).  All changes to the Trello production system, be they code or system configuration changes, require review prior to deployment to the production environment. Thousands of automated unit tests are run against all production code prior to deployment. Production code is also subject to regularly conducted automated vulnerability scans. All changes to Trello\u2019s code are tested in a staging environment prior to deployment to production. Patches to the Trello web client are deployed on a rolling basis, usually several times per week. Trello production servers are managed via a centralized configuration system. All Trello system changes are peer reviewed and patches are deployed as relevant to their level of security and stability impact, with critical patches able to be deployed well within 24 hours of availability as appropriate. We restrict access as noted above and maintain separate lists of relevant roles with access to source code, development, staging, and production environments. These lists are reviewed quarterly and upon role change. We use source code management tools and repositories. All production servers are running a LTS (Long Term Support) distribution of their operating system to ensure timely updates are available. CVE lists and notifications are actively monitored and any systems can be patched in a timeline relevant to the severity of the issue. A centralized configuration system is used for the management of production servers, and when needed a patch can be deployed within hours of its availability.  Certain user actions which manipulate user data are stored within Trello and are available for the customer/user (e.g., when viewing the action history on a card, board, or team). This information is available within Trello unless a card is deleted (not archived), at which point it cannot be restored. All Trello API calls and application logs are kept for our internal purposes for at least 30 days without sensitive information (no full user tokens, no user generated content), and are available only for authorized employees as required by their role for monitoring of Trello to ensure service availability and performance and to prevent abuse. Application logs for Trello are centrally collected in an ElasticSearch cluster for a minimum of 30 days for monitoring and analysis. Security, authentication, and Intrusion Detection System (IDS) logs for Trello are additionally retained in S3 CloudWatch buckets with a 12 month lifecycle to ensure retention.  While some assets are not owned by a specific individual, ownership and maintenance of the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of our systems is distributed amongst the SRE and Operations teams. Assets are transferred upon role change or leaving the company.  Trello validates files for well-formedness and the like, however, we have explicitly designed Trello to support any type of content users may choose to store within Trello. All attachments are stored and accessed from a completely separate domain to help prevent any potential access by such attachment to other user data or cookies.  Admins for a Trello Enterprise account will be set via the customer\u2019s account manager. Admin, regular, and observer roles can be assigned within Trello. It is not possible to limit the geolocations allowed to access data within Trello. Data can be accessed by users who have access to such data within the app from any geolocation. All third-party developer access to user data stored in Trello is via the API which includes strict authorization checks. All Authorized Personnel go through strict security group/firewall rules which limits access to authorized instance roles on authorized ports required for them to fulfill their role. Power-Ups cannot be restricted within a team. Power-Ups which connect Trello to other services (such as Evernote or Dropbox) may require authentication with an existing account in that service before the Power-Up is active. If working within a corporate environment, the domain used to authenticate that account can be blocked in your environment's firewall.   Data entered into Trello is backed up regularly. All backups are encrypted and stored at multiple offsite locations to help ensure that they are available in the unlikely event that a restore is necessary. Files uploaded to Trello as card attachments are not backed up on the same schedule, and instead rely on Amazon S3\u2019s internal redundancy mechanism. Files associated with Trello cards from a supported cloud storage provider are also subject to the storage provider\u2019s own backup procedures and policies. Trello database backups are immediately encrypted with 256-bit AES encryption using GNU Privacy Guard (\u201cGPG\u201d) with a password-protected symmetric cipher. Encrypted backups can only be decrypted by members of the Trello operations team who have received training and have been authorized to decrypt the backups. Because user data stored in Trello is on a shared infrastructure, it is not possible for us to recover a subset of that information from backups. If any customer is particularly concerned with maintaining a complete record of their information in Trello, we suggest that such customer frequently exports its data or use our API4 to connect a DLP tool to Trello.  A rolling live replica of Trello\u2019s primary database is constantly being taken on a 1-hour delay. Additionally, a full backup snapshot of the primary database is taken once every 24 hours.  All Trello backups are retained on the following schedule:  ---AWS EC2 on a dedicated backup server for two days ---AWS S3 for 7 days ---Google Cloud Storage for 30 days ---AWS Glacier for 90 days  Only authorized members of the Trello operations team have access to the backup locations, so that they are able to monitor the performance of the backup processes, and in the very unlikely event that a restore becomes necessary. After 90 days, the encrypted backup files are destroyed. Attachments directly uploaded to Trello are handled differently than the primary database backups. To backup file attachments, Trello primarily relies on S3\u2019s internal redundancy mechanism, which Amazon states provides 99.99% yearly data durability. Attachments are also backed up to Google Cloud Storage for additional redundancy.  Trello board data is available for export by board members in JSON format via the Trello REST API. File attachments can be individually retrieved directly from Amazon S3 using the file\u2019s unique hyperlink. Trello personal data is available for export by individual users in JSON format and can be found by clicking this link. The \u201cDownload Personal Data\u201d button will export personal data and deliver it via an API endpoint in JSON format. Trello Business Class and Enterprise plans offer a simplified data export process for all team data and attachments. Each Business Class and Enterprise team includes one-click export of all Boards within the team. Optionally, file attachments uploaded directly to Trello can be included in the export file. Within the export, each board\u2019s data is included in both JSON and Comma Separated Values (\u201cCSV\u201d) format.  The Trello operations team has designed systems to keep the service running even if the underlying infrastructure experiences an outage or other significant issue. Every critical Trello service has a secondary, replicated service running simultaneously with mirrored data in a different AWS availability zone than the primary server. Additionally, each Trello database server has a replicated service running in a third availability zone with data that is mirrored on a one hour delay. Because it is critical to have reliable access to your business\u2019 important projects and data, Trello has been architected to survive a single availability zone outage without significant service interruptions.  In the unlikely event that two Amazon EC2 availability zones have long-term service interruptions, Trello has been designed to recover with limited service interruption and a target maximum of 1 hour of data loss. In the even more unlikely event that Trello\u2019s entire AWS EC2 region is irrecoverably lost, we will restore servers using automated configuration systems. In this event, Trello\u2019s systems are designed to recover user data as quickly as reasonably possible, with a target of no more than of 24 hours of data loss. Trello's SRE team regularly tests the various components of its Business Continuity architecture to ensure continued operations. Trello does not currently run anything like Chaos Monkey. Trello does not have an SLA or credit policy. Trello had over 99.99% uptime in 2017 and 2018, and any downtime is documented at Trello's status page.5  A Trello problem impacting a Trello Enterprise customer will be assigned a Severity Level and handled according to the resolutions in Table 1. Table 1: Incidents and Response Severity Levels:    Level Description Resolution Examples     Severity 1 Trello is not available or is unusable. Work begins within 1 hour from report, temporary resolution within 4 hours, final resolution within 7 hours. The site is not responding; all text on the site is being translated into elven runes.   Severity 2 Service or performance is substantially degraded in a way that prevents normal use. Work begins within 2 hours from report, temporary resolution within 48 hours, final resolution within 14 days. Search only finds cards with the search terms in the title; Trello cannot be used with the new Firefox version that came out today.   Severity 3 A service not essential to Trello\u2019s main functionality is unavailable or degraded. Work begins within 72 hours from report, temporary resolution within 7 days, final resolution within 30 days. Activity indicators are not showing who is active; updates are taking 30 seconds to propagate to other board viewers.   Severity 4 Minor or cosmetic issues with Trello services, and all feature requests. Resolution at Trello team\u2019s discretion. Board background images aren\u2019t scaling properly; feature request for dependencies between cards.      Trello has a centrally managed antivirus solution deployed across both our Windows and macOS environments. For Authorized Personnel, any workstations running Windows or macOS used for ssh terminal access to the production environment must be running update-to-date and active instances of our centrally deployed Cylance antivirus software with real-time monitoring and at-least-daily updates. Authorized Personnel may choose to run linux as their workstation operating system. Given the inadequate state of linux antivirus software and the lack of prevalence of viruses for that platform, our policy does not require those workstations to run antivirus. All of the existing controls for Authorized Personnel, including restricting access from those workstations to the production environment via ssh terminal connections only and with no replication of user data onto those workstations, still apply.  Many of Trello\u2019s team members work remotely. Strict firewall rules are in place thus limiting access to the production environment to our VPN network and authorized systems. Certain other controls described above, including Authorized Personnel and corporate environment controls, also apply to remote access as appropriate.  Security awareness and user data access policies are covered during our employee onboarding as appropriate to the role and employees are updated as relevant policies or practices change. Our employees also sign a confidentiality agreement. In the event that a security policy is breached by an employee, Trello reserves the right to determine the appropriate response, which may include termination.  All our employees undergo an extensive interview process before hiring. Our employees with direct access to the production environment undergo a criminal background check. Other employees may undergo a check depending on their role (e.g., academic for legal roles or credit for finance roles). Appropriate NDAs are in place with third parties as appropriate.   When it is necessary to perform planned maintenance on Trello services, the Trello operations team will perform the work during one of two scheduled weekly maintenance windows. We will make reasonable efforts to announce maintenance procedures that could potentially impact users of Trello on the @trellostatus Twitter account6 at least 24 hours prior to the event, and via an in-app announcement at least 30 minutes prior to the event.   ---Tuesday from 10:00 PM US Eastern Time through Wednesday at 2:00 AM US Eastern Time ---Saturday from 10:00 PM US Eastern Time through Sunday at 2:00 AM US Eastern Time  These windows have been selected with the goal of minimizing service downtime, slowness, or other impact to the people and businesses that rely on Trello. We do our best to make outages as short as possible. Additionally, our maintenance schedule will frequently be evaluated to ensure that we keep user impact as low as reasonably possible. Should we need to reschedule these windows, the updated schedule will be announced on our Status Blog and Twitter accounts with reasonable advance notice.  Due to unforeseen events, we may have to infrequently perform unplanned maintenance on Trello infrastructure or software components. This maintenance might cause some or all of the Trello services to be inaccessible by our users for a period of time. It is our goal to do this as infrequently as possible. Any unplanned or emergency maintenance that causes Trello to be inaccessible will be announced on the Trello Status Blog and in-app with as much advance notice as reasonably possible. As with planned maintenance, we do our best to minimize disruption caused by service outages. It is not possible for us to customize the maintenance window, as our users are on a shared infrastructure. However, we've used this maintenance window extremely rarely\u2014about once a year, for under 15 minutes each time.

Whether you designate yourself as a technical contact, open a support ticket, speak to one of our representatives directly or otherwise engage with our support team, you will be asked to provide contact information, a summary of the problem you are experiencing, and any other documentation, screenshots or information that would be helpful in resolving the issue. ---Payment Information: We collect certain payment and billing information when you register for certain paid Services. For example, we ask you to designate a billing representative, including name and contact information, upon registration. You might also provide payment information, such as payment card details, which we collect via secure payment processing services.   We collect information about you when you use our Services, including browsing our websites and taking certain actions within the Services.   ---Your use of the Services: We keep track of certain information about you when you visit and interact with any of our Services. This information includes the features you use; the cards, boards, teams and other links you click on; the type, size and filenames of attachments you upload to the Services; frequently used search terms; and how you interact with others on the Services. We also collect information about the teams and people you work with and how you interact with them, like who you collaborate with and communicate with most frequently. ---Device and Connection Information: We collect information about your computer, phone, tablet, or other devices you use to access the Services. This device information includes your connection type and settings when you install, access, update, or use our Services. We also collect information through your device about your operating system, browser type, IP address, URLs of referring/exit pages, device identifiers, and crash data. We use your IP address and/or country preference in order to approximate your location to provide you with a better Service experience. How much of this information we collect depends on the type and settings of the device you use to access the Services.  ---Cookies and Other Tracking Technologies: Trello and our third-party partners, such as our advertising and analytics partners, use cookies and other tracking technologies (e.g., web beacons, device identifiers and pixels) to provide functionality and to recognize you across different Services and devices. For more information, please see our Cookies and Tracking Notice,3 which includes information on how to control or opt out of these cookies and tracking technologies.   We receive information about you from other Service users, from third party services, from the Atlassian product family and related companies, and from our business and channel partners.   ---Other users of the Services: Other users of our Services may provide information about you when they submit content through the Services. For example, you may be mentioned by someone else on a card, or a team member may upload content about you to a board. We also receive your email address from other Service users when they provide it in order to invite you to the Services. Similarly, an administrator may provide your contact information when they designate you as another administrator for a board, team or an enterprise or business account.  ---Other services you link to your account: We receive information about you when you or your administrator enable third-party apps like Power-Ups or integrate or link a third-party service with our Services. For example, if you create an account or log into the Services using your Google credentials, we receive your name and email address as permitted by your Google profile settings in order to authenticate you. You or your administrator may also integrate our Services with other services you use, such as to allow you to access, store, share and edit certain content from a third-party through our Services. For example, you may authorize our Services to access and display files from a third-party document-sharing service within the Services interface. Or you may authorize our Services to sync a contact list or address book so that you can easily connect with those contacts within the Services or invite them to collaborate with you on our Services. The information we receive when you link or integrate our Services with a third-party service depends on the settings, permissions and privacy policy controlled by that third-party service. You should always check the privacy settings and notices in these third-party services to understand what data may be disclosed to us or shared with our Services. ---Atlassian Companies: We joined the Atlassian product family  in 2017. As part of this relationship, we receive analytics, account, profile, content related information and other information about you from companies that are owned or operated by Atlassian, in accordance with their terms and policies.  ---Trello Partners: We work with a global network of partners who provide consulting, implementation, training and other services around our products.4 Some of these partners also help us to market and promote our products, generate leads for us, and resell our products. We receive information from these partners, such as billing information, billing and technical contact information, company name, what products you have purchased or may be interested in, evaluation information you have provided, what events you have attended, and what country you are in.  ---Other partners: We receive information about you and your activities on and off the Services from third-party partners, such as advertising and market research partners who provide us with information about your interest in, and engagement with, our Services and online advertisements.    How we use the information we collect depends in part on which Services you use, how you use them, and any preferences you have communicated to us. Below are the specific purposes for which we use the information we collect about you.  ---To provide the Services and personalize your experience: We use information about you to provide the Services to you, including to process transactions with you, authenticate you when you log in, provide customer support, and operate and maintain the Services. For example, we use the name and picture you provide in your account to identify you to other Service users. Our Services also include tailored features that personalize your experience, enhance your productivity, and improve your ability to collaborate effectively with others by automatically analyzing the activities of your team to provide search results, activity feeds, notifications, connections and recommendations that are most relevant for you and your team. We may use your email domain to infer your affiliation with a particular organization or industry to personalize the content and experience you receive on our websites. Where you use Trello and other Atlassian owned or operated services, we may combine information about you and your activities to provide an integrated experience, such as to allow you to find information from one service while searching from another or to present relevant product information as you travel across our websites.  ---For research and development: We are always looking for ways to make our Services smarter, faster, secure, integrated and useful to you. We use collective learnings about how people use our Services and feedback provided directly to us to troubleshoot and to identify trends, usage, activity patterns and areas for integration and improvement of the Services. For example, we used information collected about how users enable Power-Ups from within the product to design a better, more user-friendly Power-Ups button. In some cases, we apply these learnings across Trello and other Atlassian owned or operated services to improve and develop similar features or to better integrate the services you use. We also test and analyze certain new features with some users before rolling the feature out to all users.  ---To communicate with you about the Services: We use your contact information to send transactional communications via email and within the Services, including confirming your purchases, reminding you of subscription expirations, responding to your comments, questions and requests, providing customer support, and sending you technical notices, updates, security alerts, and administrative messages. Depending on your settings, we send you email notifications when you or others interact on the Services, for example, when you are @mentioned on a card or when you are added to a board. We also provide tailored communications based on your activity and interactions with us. For example, certain actions you take in the Services may automatically trigger a feature or third-party app suggestion within the Services that would make that task easier. We also send you communications as you onboard to a particular Service to help you become more proficient in using that Service. These communications are part of the Services and in most cases you cannot opt out of them. If an opt out is available, you will find that option within the communication itself or in your account settings.  ---To market, promote, and drive engagement with the Services: We use your contact information and information about how you use the Services to send promotional communications that may be of specific interest to you, including by email and by displaying Atlassian ads on other companies' websites and applications, as well as on platforms like Facebook and Google. These communications are aimed at driving engagement and maximizing what you get out of the Services, including information about new features, survey requests, newsletters, and events we think may be of interest to you. We also communicate with you about new product offers, promotions and contests. You can control whether you receive these communications as described below under \"Opt-out of communications.\" ---Customer support: We use your information to resolve technical issues you encounter, to respond to your requests for assistance, to analyze crash information, and to repair and improve the Services. Where you give us permission to do so, we share your information with a Trello Expert for the purpose of responding to support-related requests. Please be aware the Trello experts are other Trello users, not employees of, or directly affiliated with Trello. ---For safety and security: We use information about you and your Service use to verify accounts and activity, to monitor suspicious or fraudulent activity and to identify violations of Service policies.  ---To protect our legitimate business interests and legal rights: Where required by law or where we believe it is necessary to protect our legal rights, interests and the interests of others, we use information about you in connection with legal claims, compliance, regulatory, and audit functions, and disclosures in connection with the acquisition, merger or sale of a business.  ---With your consent: We use information about you where you have given us consent to do so for a specific purpose not listed above. For example, we may publish testimonials or featured customer stories to promote the Services, with your permission.  ---Legal bases for processing (for EEA users): If you are an individual in the European Economic Area (EEA), we collect and process information about you only where we have legal bases for doing so under applicable EU laws. The legal bases depend on the Services you use and how you use them. This means we collect and use your information only where:  ---We need it to provide you the Services, including to operate the Services, provide customer support and personalized features and to protect the safety and security of the Services; --- It satisfies a legitimate interest (which is not overridden by your data protection interests), such as for research and development, to market and promote the Services and to protect our legal rights and interests; --- You give us consent to do so for a specific purpose; or --- We need to process your data to comply with a legal obligation.   If you have consented to our use of information about you for a specific purpose, you have the right to change your mind at any time, but this will not affect any processing that has already taken place. Where we are using your information because we or a third party (e.g. your employer) have a legitimate interest to do so, you have the right to object to that use though, in some cases, this may mean no longer using the Services.    We make collaboration tools, and we want them to work well for you. This means sharing information through the Services and with certain third parties. We share information we collect about you in the ways discussed below, including in connection with possible business transfers, but we are not in the business of selling information about you to advertisers or other third parties.   When you use the Services, we share certain information about you with other Service users.  ---For collaboration: You can create content, which may contain information about you, and grant permission to others to see, share, edit, copy and download that content based on settings you or your administrator (if applicable) select. Some of the collaboration features of the Services display some or all of your profile information to other Service users when you share or interact with specific content. For example, when you comment on a card, we display your profile picture and name next to your comments so that other users with access to the card understand who made the comment. Similarly, when you join a team, your name, profile picture and contact information and will be displayed in a list for other team members so they can find and interact with you. Please be aware that some boards can be made publicly available, meaning any content posted on that board, including information about you, can be publicly viewed and indexed by and returned in search results of search engines. You can check the board settings at any time to confirm whether a particular board is public or private. ---Managed accounts and administrators: If you register or access the Services using an email address with a domain that is owned by your employer or organization, or associate that email address with your existing account and such organization wishes to establish a Trello or Atlassian services account, certain information about you including your name, profile picture, contact info, content, and account use may become accessible to that organization\u2019s administrator and other Trello or Atlassian service users, as permitted by your administrator, to provide you additional products and services or to integrate your Trello Services with Atlassian or other products and services. For example, your organization may request that we provide extra security controls around your account to protect information about your organization or your organization may request that we link your Trello account with your Atlassian account to enhance collaboration and functionality among tools you use. If you are the administrator of a board, team or enterprise or business account within the Services, we may share your contact information with current or past Service users, for the purpose of facilitating Service-related requests.  ---Community Forums: Our websites offer publicly accessible blogs, forums, bug trackers, and wikis like Trello Community5 and Trello Inspiration.6 You should be aware that any information you provide in these websites - including profile information associated with the account you use to post the information - may be read, collected, and used by any member of the public who accesses websites. Your posts and certain profile information may remain even after you terminate your account. We urge you to consider the sensitivity of any information you input into these Services. To request removal of your information from publicly accessible websites operated by us, please contact us as provided below. In some cases, we may not be able to remove your information, in which case we will let you know if we are unable to and why.   We share information with third parties that help us operate, provide, improve, integrate, customize, support and market our Services.  ---Service Providers: We work with third-party service providers to provide website and application development, hosting, maintenance, backup, storage, virtual infrastructure, payment processing, analysis and other services for us, which may require them to access or use information about you. If a service provider needs to access information about you to perform services on our behalf, they do so under instruction from us, including abiding by policies and procedures designed to protect your information. ---Trello Partners: We work with third parties who provide consulting, sales, support and technical services to deliver and implement customer solutions around the Services, including the Atlassian global partner network.7 We may share your information with these third parties in connection with their services, such as to assist with billing and collections, to provide localized support, and to provide customizations. We may also share information with these third parties where you have agreed to that sharing, like when you agree to us sharing your information with a Trello Expert for support-related questions. ---Third-Party apps: You, your administrator or other Service users may choose to add new functionality or change the behavior of the Services by enabling third party apps like Power-Ups within the Services. Doing so may give third-party apps access to your account and information about you like your name and email address, and any content you choose to use in connection with those apps. If you are an administrator or contact listed on an account, we share your details with the third-party app provider upon installation. Third-party app policies and procedures are not controlled by us, and this privacy policy does not cover how third-party apps use your information. We encourage you to review the privacy policies of third parties before connecting to or using their applications or services to learn more about their privacy and information handling practices. If you object to information about you being shared with these third parties, please disable the app. ---Links to Third-Party Sites: The Services may include links that direct you to other websites or services whose privacy practices may differ from ours. Your use of and any information you submit to any of those third-party sites is governed by their privacy policies, not this one.  ---Third-Party Widgets: Some of our Services contain widgets and social media features, such as the Twitter \"tweet\" button. These widgets and features collect your IP address, which page you are visiting on the Services, and may set a cookie to enable the feature to function properly. Widgets and social media features are either hosted by a third party or hosted directly on our Services. Your interactions with these features are governed by the privacy policy of the company providing it.  ---With your consent: We share information about you with third parties when you give us consent to do so. For example, we often display personal testimonials of satisfied customers on our public websites. With your consent, we may post your name alongside the testimonial.  ---Compliance with Enforcement Requests and Applicable Laws; Enforcement of Our Rights: In exceptional circumstances, we may share information about you with a third party if we believe that sharing is reasonably necessary to (a) comply with any applicable law, regulation, legal process or governmental request, including to meet national security requirements, (b) enforce our agreements, policies and terms of service, (c) protect the security or integrity of our products and services, (d) protect Trello, our customers or the public from harm or illegal activities, or (e) respond to an emergency which we believe in good faith requires us to disclose information to assist in preventing the death or serious bodily injury of any person. For more information on how we respond to government requests, see our Guidelines for Law Enforcement8 and our Transparency Report.9   We share information we collect with affiliated companies and, in some cases, with prospective affiliates. Affiliated companies are companies owned or operated by Atlassian. The protections of this privacy policy apply to the information we share in these circumstances.  ---Atlassian Companies: We share information we have about you with Atlassian corporate affiliates in order to operate and improve products and services and to offer other Atlassian affiliated services to you. This includes companies that own or operate the services in the Atlassian product family.10  ---Business transfers: We may share or transfer information we collect under this privacy policy in connection with any merger, sale of company assets, financing, or acquisition of all or a portion of the Trello or Atlassian businesses to another company. You will be notified via email and/or a prominent notice on the Services if a transaction takes place, as well as any choices you may have regarding your information.    We use data hosting service providers in the United States to host the information we collect, and we use technical measures to secure your data. While we implement safeguards designed to protect your information, no security system is impenetrable and due to the inherent nature of the Internet, we cannot guarantee that data, during transmission through the Internet or while stored on our systems or otherwise in our care, is absolutely safe from intrusion by others. We will respond to requests about this within a reasonable timeframe.   How long we keep information we collect about you depends on the type of information, as described in further detail below. After such time, we will either delete or anonymize your information or, if this is not possible (for example, because the information has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your information and isolate it from any further use until deletion is possible.   ---Account information: We retain your account information until you delete your account. We also retain some of your information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, to resolve disputes, to enforce our agreements, to support business operations and to continue to develop and improve our Services. Where we retain information for Service improvement and development, we take steps to eliminate information that directly identifies you, and we only use the information to uncover collective insights about the use of our Services, not to specifically analyze personal characteristics about you. ---Information you share on the Services: If your account is deactivated or disabled, some of your information and the content you have provided will remain in order to allow your team members or other users to make full use of the Services. For example, we continue to display comments and content you provided to boards or cards.  ---Managed accounts: If the Services are made available to you through an organization (e.g., your employer), we retain your information as long as required by the administrator of your account. For more information, see \"Managed accounts and administrators\" above. ---Marketing information: If you have elected to receive marketing emails from us, we retain information about your marketing preferences unless you specifically ask us to delete such information. We retain information derived from cookies and other tracking technologies for a reasonable period of time from the date such information was created.    You have certain choices available to you when it comes to your information. Below is a summary of those choices, how to exercise them and any limitations. We will respond to requests about this within a reasonable timeframe.  You have the right to request a copy of your information, to object to our use of your information (including for marketing purposes), to request the deletion or restriction of your information, or to request your information in a structured, electronic format. Below, we describe the tools and processes for making these requests. You can exercise some of the choices by logging into the Services and using settings available within the Services or your account. Where the Services are administered for you by an administrator (see \"Notice to End Users\" below), you may need to contact your administrator to assist with your requests first. For all other requests, you may contact us as provided in the Contact Us section below to request assistance. Your request and choices may be limited in certain cases: for example, if fulfilling your request would reveal information about another person, or if you ask to delete information which we or your administrator are permitted by law or have compelling legitimate interests to keep. Where you have asked us to share data with third parties, for example, by enabling a Power-Up, you will need to contact those third-party service providers directly to have your information deleted or otherwise restricted. If you have unresolved concerns, you may have the right to complain to a data protection authority in the country where you live, where you work or where you feel your rights were infringed.  ---Access and update your information: Our Services and related documentation11 give you the ability to access and update certain information about you from within the Service. For example, you can access your profile information from your account and search for content containing information about you using key word searches in the Service. You can update your profile information within your profile settings and modify content that contains information about you using the editing tools associated with that content. ---Deactivate membership to a board, team or enterprise: You or an administrator can deactivate your access to a board, team or enterprise. If you can deactivate your own access, that setting is available to you in your account settings. Otherwise, please contact your administrator. If you are an administrator and are unable to deactivate an account through your administrator settings, please contact Trello support.12 Please be aware that deactivating access to a board, team or enterprise does not delete your information from that board, team or enterprise; your information remains visible to other Service users based on your past participation within the Services. For more information on how to delete your information, see below.  ---Delete your information: Our Services and related documentation13 give you the ability to delete certain information about you from within the Service. For example, you can remove content that contains information about you using the key word search and editing tools associated with that content and you can remove certain profile information within your profile settings. Please note, however, that we may need to retain certain information for record keeping purposes, to complete transactions or to comply with our legal obligations.  ---Request that we stop using your information: In some cases, you may ask us to stop accessing, storing, using and otherwise processing your information where you believe we don't have the appropriate rights to do so. For example, if you believe a Services account was created for you without your permission or you are no longer an active user, you can request that we delete your account as provided in this policy. Where you gave us consent to use your information for a limited purpose, you can contact us to withdraw that consent, but this will not affect any processing that has already taken place at the time. You can also opt-out of our use of your information for marketing purposes by contacting us, as provided below. When you make such requests, we may need time to investigate and facilitate your request. If there is a delay or dispute as to whether we have the right to continue using your information, we will restrict any further use of your information until the request is honored or the dispute is resolved, provided your administrator does not object (where applicable). If you object to information about you being shared with a third-party app, please disable the app or contact your administrator to do so. --- Opt out of communications: You may opt out of receiving promotional communications from us by using the unsubscribe link within each email, updating your email preferences within your Service account settings menu, or by contacting us as provided below to have your contact information removed from our promotional email list or registration database. Even after you opt out from receiving promotional messages from us, you will continue to receive transactional messages from us regarding our Services. You can opt out of some notification messages in your account settings. Please note, you will continue to receive generic ads. You may be able to opt out of receiving personalized advertisements from other companies who are members of the Network Advertising Initiative or who subscribe to the Digital Advertising Alliance's Self-Regulatory Principles for Online Behavioral Advertising. For more information about this practice and to understand your options, please visit: http://www.aboutads.info, http://optout.networkadvertising.org/ and http://www.youronlinechoices.eu.  ---Turn off Cookie Controls: Relevant browser-based cookie controls are described in our Cookies & Tracking Notice.14 ---Send \"Do Not Track\" Signals: Some browsers have incorporated \"Do Not Track\" (DNT) features that can send a signal to the websites you visit indicating you do not wish to be tracked. Because there is not yet a common understanding of how to interpret the DNT signal, our Services do not currently respond to browser DNT signals. You can use the range of other tools we provide to control data collection and use, including the ability to opt out of receiving marketing from us as described above. ---Data portability: Data portability is the ability to obtain some of your information in a format you can move from one service provider to another (for instance, when you transfer your mobile phone number to another carrier). Depending on the context, this applies to some of your information, but not to all of your information. Should you request it, we will provide you with an electronic file of your basic account information and the information you create on the spaces under your sole control, like your own boards.     We collect information globally and primarily store that information in the United States. We transfer, process and store your information outside of your country of residence, to wherever we, Atlassian or our third-party service providers operate for the purpose of providing you the Services. Whenever we transfer your information, we take steps to protect it.   ---International transfers within the Atlassian Companies: To facilitate our global operations, we transfer information to the United States and allow access to that information from countries in which Trello and other Atlassian corporate affiliates have operations for the purposes described in this policy. These countries may not have equivalent privacy and data protection laws to the laws of many of the countries where our customers and users are based. When we share information about you within and among Atlassian corporate affiliates, we make use of standard contractual data protection clauses, which have been approved by the European Commission, and we rely on the EU-U.S. and Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework to safeguard the transfer of information we collect from the European Economic Area and Switzerland. Please see our Privacy Shield notice below for more information or contact us as provided below. ---International transfers to third parties: Some of the third parties described in this privacy policy, which provide services to us under contract, are based in other countries that may not have equivalent privacy and data protection laws to the country in which you reside. When we share information of customers in the European Economic Area or Switzerland, we make use of the EU-U.S. and Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield Frameworks, European Commission-approved standard contractual data protection clauses, binding corporate rules for transfers to data processors, or other appropriate legal mechanisms to safeguard the transfer. Please see our Privacy Shield Notice below.    Trello, Inc. and the U.S.-based Atlassian corporate affiliates (Atlassian, Inc., Atlassian Network Service, Inc., and Dogwood Labs, Inc.) participate in and comply with the EU-U.S. and Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield Frameworks and the Privacy Shield Principles regarding the collection, use, and retention of information about you that is transferred from the European Union or Switzerland (as applicable) to the U.S. We ensure that the Privacy Shield Principles apply to all information about you that is subject to this privacy policy and is received from the European Union, the European Economic Area, and Switzerland.  Under the EU-U.S. and Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield Frameworks, we are responsible for the processing of information about you we receive from the EU and Switzerland and onward transfers to a third party acting as an agent on our behalf. We comply with the Privacy Shield Principles for such onward transfers and remain liable in accordance with the Privacy Shield Principles if third-party agents that we engage to process such information about you on our behalf do so in a manner inconsistent with the Privacy Shield Principles, unless we prove that we are not responsible for the event giving rise to the damage.  To learn more about the Privacy Shield Program, and to view our certification, please visit our public Privacy Shield listing.15 We encourage you to contact us as provided below should you have a Privacy Shield-related (or general privacy-related) complaint. If you have an unresolved privacy or data use concern that we have not addressed satisfactorily, please contact our U.S.-based third-party dispute resolution provider16 (free of charge). Through this third-party dispute resolution provider, we have also committed to cooperating and complying with the information and advice provided by an informal panel of data protection authorities in the European Economic Area and/or the Swiss Federal Data Protection and Information Commissioner (as applicable) in relation to unresolved complaints (as further described in the Privacy Shield Principles). You may also contact your local data protection authority within the European Economic Area or Switzerland (as applicable) for unresolved complaints.  Under certain conditions, more fully described on the Privacy Shield website,17 including when other dispute resolution procedures have been exhausted, you may invoke binding arbitration.  We are subject to the investigatory and enforcement powers of the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC).   Our products are intended for both personal use and use by organizations. Where the Services are made available to you through an organization (e.g. your employer), that organization is the administrator of the Services and is responsible for the end-users and/or Service sites over which it has control. If this is the case, please direct your data privacy questions to your administrator, as your use of the Services is subject to that organization's policies. We are not responsible for the privacy or security practices of an administrator's organization, which may be different than this policy.  Even if the Services are not currently administered to you by an organization, if you are a member of a team administered by an organization, or if you use an email address provided by an organization (such as your work email address) to access the Services, then the administrator of that team or the owner of the domain associated with your organizational email address (e.g. your employer) may assert administrative control over your account and use of the Services at a later date. You will be notified if this happens.  Board, team, and enterprise administrators are able to restrict your access to and privileges within the respective board, team or enterprise the administrator controls. In some cases, enterprise administrators can also: ---require you to reset your account password; ---restrict, suspend or terminate your access to the Services or your account; ---control your ability to edit, restrict, modify or delete account information; ---change your account information, including profile information or the email address associated with your account; ---access information in and about your account; ---access or retain information stored as part of your account; and ---enable or disable Power-Ups, third-party apps, or other integrations.  If you do not want an administrator to be able to assert control over your account or use of the Services, you should deactivate your membership with the relevant board, team or enterprise or remove any email addresses containing a domain owned or controlled by the administrator entirely from your account. Once an administrator asserts control over your account or use of the Services, you may no longer be able to withdraw membership or change the email address associated with your account without administrator approval.  Please contact your organization or refer to your administrator\u2019s organizational policies for more information.  The Services are not directed to individuals under 16. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 16. If we become aware that a child under 16 has provided us with personal information, we will take steps to delete such information. If you become aware that a child has provided us with personal information, please contact our support services.18   We may change this privacy policy from time to time. We will post any privacy policy changes on this page and, if the changes are significant, we will provide a more prominent notice by adding a notice on the Services homepages, login screens, or by sending you an email notification. We will also keep prior versions of this Privacy Policy in an archive for your review. We encourage you to review our privacy policy whenever you use the Services to stay informed about our information practices and the ways you can help protect your privacy. If you disagree with any changes to this privacy policy, you will need to stop using the Services and deactivate your account(s), as outlined above.  Your information is controlled by Trello, Inc. If you have questions or concerns about how your information is handled, please direct your inquiry to Trello Inc., as set forth below or, if you are a resident of the European Economic Area, please contact our EU Representative.  --- Trello, Inc. c/o Atlassian, Inc. 1098 Harrison Street San Francisco, CA 94103 E-Mail: privacy@trello.com  --- EU Representative: Atlassian B.V. c/o Atlassian, Inc. 1098 Harrison Street San Francisco, CA 94103 E-Mail: privacy@trello.com         Footnotes: 1https://www.atlassian.com/software 2https://www.atlassian.com/legal/privacy-policy  3https://www.atlassian.com/legal/cookies   4https://www.atlassian.com/software 5https://community.atlassian.com/t5/Trello/ct-p/trello  6https://trello.com/inspiration  7https://www.atlassian.com/software 8https://www.atlassian.com/trust/privacy/guidelines-for-law-enforcement  9https://www.atlassian.com/trust/privacy/transparency-report  10https://www.atlassian.com/software 11https://help.trello.com  12https://trello.com/contact  13https://help.trello.com  14https://www.atlassian.com/legal/cookies   15https://www.privacyshield.gov/participant?id=a2zt00000004FK0AAM&status=Active  16https://feedback-form.truste.com/watchdog/request  17https://www.privacyshield.gov/welcome  18https://trello.com/contact           ", "https://trello.com/legal": "       "}, "tumblr.com": {"https://www.tumblr.com/privacy/en": "   Tumblr                        JavaScript is required to view this site.      The original version of this Privacy Policy is written in English. To the extent any translated version of this Privacy Policy conflicts with the English version, the English version controls.\n    Tumblr, Inc. (\"Tumblr,\" \"we,\" \"us,\" or \"our\") takes the private nature of your information very seriously. This policy regarding our privacy practices (the \"Privacy Policy\") describes how we treat the information we collect when you visit and use tumblr.com (the \"Site\") and/or Tumblr's other domains, products, advertising products, services, and/or content, including our iOS and Android mobile applications (collectively with the Site, the \"Services\"). Tumblr, along with Yahoo, is now part of Oath, a digital and mobile media company with more than 50 brands globally, and a member of the Verizon family of companies. The way we handle your information hasn\u2019t changed, so this Privacy Policy still governs when you are on Tumblr, using a Tumblr app or interacting with our products, services or technologies.  We may share non-personal information with our family companies for purposes such as product improvements, research and analysis, and to help them provide you with more relevant experiences. When you use the Services, you also consent to the collection, transfer, manipulation, storage, disclosure and other uses of your information as described in this Privacy Policy; please read it carefully.\n    This Privacy Policy covers our treatment of information gathered when you are using or accessing the Services. This Privacy Policy also covers our treatment of any information about you that our partners share with us or that we share with our partners.\n    This Privacy Policy does not apply to the practices of third parties that we do not own, control, or manage, including but not limited to any third party websites, services, applications, or businesses (\u201cThird Party Services\u201d). While we try to work only with those Third Party Services that share our respect for your privacy, we don't take responsibility for the content or privacy policies of those Third Party Services. We encourage you to carefully review the privacy policies of all Third Party Services you access.\n    Also: This Privacy Policy doesn\u2019t govern what our users do on their Tumblr blogs and we aren't responsible for the information collection and use practices of our individual blogs and bloggers. One of the great features of Tumblr's products is customizability, and bloggers have a lot of flexibility in how their blogs behave. When you visit a blog in our network, that blog may collect more information than we do, and may provide information to third parties that we have no relationship with, including to advertisers.\nAccount Information: When you create an account on the Services (an \"Account\"), we\u2019ll ask you for information such as your username, password, age, and email address (\u201cAccount Information\u201d). We may use Account Information, alone or together with other information, to enhance and improve the Services, such as by personalization. We use your age to verify that you can lawfully use the Services. We use your email address to verify your Account and to communicate with you, as described in more detail below. We also allow users to look for their friends by email address; you can, however, opt out of email lookup through your Account Settings.\n    You can keep yourself fairly anonymous on Tumblr, but remember that your posts, blogs, pages, and username are all visible to the public by default. People that know your email address can also find your blogs. If you\u2019d rather be unlisted, head over to your Account Settings.Email Communications with Us: As part of the Services, you may occasionally receive email and other communications from us. Administrative communications relating to your Account (e.g., for purposes of Account recovery or password reset) are considered part of the Services and your Account, which you may not be able to opt-out from receiving. We also may send you other kinds of emails, which you can opt-out of either from your Account Settings page or by using the \u201cOpt-Out\u201d link in the emails themselves. Note that we will never email you to ask for your password or other Account Information; if you receive such an email, please forward it to us.We send two kinds of email: ones about fun stuff happening on Tumblr, and ones with important information about your account. You can opt out of the former, but not the latter.Information about Your Accounts on Third Party Services: You can link your Account to certain Third Party Services. In order to do so, you may provide us with your username or other user ID for a Third Party Service, and you may then be required to log into that Service. After you complete this login process, we will receive a token that allows us to access your account on that service so that we can, for example, post your content to that service when you ask us to. We do not receive or store your passwords for your Third Party Service accounts.\nInformation Obtained from Third Party Services: In some cases, we partner with Third Party Services that may provide information about you. Such information could include, for example, your gender, if you have disclosed that information to that third party and made it available for Tumblr to access. To the extent we obtain such information, we may use it to develop new Services or to improve or enhance the Services.\n    When you connect other services to your Tumblr account, those services might share information about you with us. What gets shown to us is determined by their privacy policies, which are long and boring, but which you should probably read if you have questions or concerns.User Content: By default, all sharing through the Services is public, and when you provide us with content it is published so that anyone can view it. Although we do provide tools, like password-protected blogs, Asks, and Fan Mail, that let you publish content privately, you should assume that anything you publish is publicly accessible unless you have explicitly selected otherwise. Also, please keep in mind that anything you share privately with another user, particularly through an Ask, Fan Mail, or submitted post, may be posted publicly by that user. Content published and shared publicly is accessible to everyone, including search engines, and you may lose any privacy rights you might have regarding that content. In addition, information shared publicly may be copied and shared throughout the Internet, including through actions or features native to the Services, such as reblogging.\n    At its heart, Tumblr is a public platform. Don\u2019t be afraid to share amazing things, but do understand that it can be hard to completely remove things from the internet once they\u2019ve been reblogged a few times.Native Actions: The Services allow you to perform native actions that are integral to our products, such as liking a post, reblogging a post, replying to a post, and following a blog. Liking, reblogging, and replying are public actions \u2013 anyone can expand the \u201cnotes\u201d view on a post, for example, to see who liked, reblogged, or replied to a post. We use information about native actions to improve the Services, develop new Services, and, particularly, to personalize your Tumblr experience. Personalization using this information may include presenting you with new posts relevant to what you\u2019ve liked, providing you with better search results, and showing you advertising more relevant to your interests.\n    Reblogs, Likes, and Replies are a matter of public record, so if you\u2019re truly ashamed of your desires it\u2019s best to keep them to yourself. But why? Be proud of who you are. You\u2019re beautiful. We\u2019re looking you in the eyes and telling you how beautiful you are.Information About User Content: In some cases, we may collect information about content you provide to the Services. For example, when it's included as part of your images, we may collect information describing your camera, camera settings, or EXIF information. This information allows us to improve the Services and provide additional features and functionality.Financial Information: We will sometimes collect financial information, such as information related to your payment method (valid credit card number, type, expiration date or other financial information). This happens when you decide to purchase a paid Service. We do not, however, store that financial information; such information is stored by our payment processor (the \"Payment Processor\"), and use and storage of that information is governed by the Payment Processor\u2019s applicable terms of service and privacy policy (the Payment Processor may also have other terms, and you are responsible for locating and familiarizing yourself with those terms, as applicable). We do receive certain information from our Payment Processor: (1) a unique token that we connect with your Account to enable you to make further purchases using the information stored by our Payment Processor and (2) in certain cases, the last four digits of the credit card number associated with that token, so that we can prevent fraudulent transactions and identity theft.\nInformation Related to Use of the Services: We collect information about how people use the Services, including those with an Account. This type of information may be collected in our log files each time you interact with (i.e., make a request to) the Services. We use internal tools and third party applications and services (like Google Analytics or comScore) to collect and analyze this information. Some of this information may also be associated with the Internet Protocol Address (\u201cIP Address\u201d) used to access the Services; some may be connected with your Account; and some may only be collected and used in aggregate form (as a statistical measure that wouldn\u2019t identify you or your Account). We also collect your IP Address when you make a post, particularly when you submit an anonymous \u201cAsk.\u201d We may use this information about how you and others interact with the Services for a number of things generally related to enhancing, improving, protecting, and developing new Services, including but not limited to: providing users with personalized content; providing users with targeted advertising; improving our search results; identifying trending or popular content; fighting spam, malware, identity theft and generally keeping our users and community safe; and for legal and safety reasons as set forth in \u201cInformation Disclosed for Our Protection and the Protection of Others.\u201d\n    We use information about how you interact with Tumblr in order to personalize it for you, to keep both you and our community safe from harm, and to improve Tumblr for everyone who uses it.Information Related to Your Web Browser: We automatically receive and record information from your web browser when you interact with the Services, such as your browser type and version, what sort of device you are using, your operating system and version, your language preference, the website or service that referred you to the Services, the date and time of each request you make to the Services, your screen display information, and information from any cookies we have placed on your web browser (as described below). We also sometimes detect whether you are using certain web browser extensions and store that information in a manner associated with your Account. We use web browser-related information to enhance and improve the Services.\nLocation Information: In some cases we collect and store information about where you are located, such as by converting your IP Address into a rough geolocation. We may also ask you to provide information about your location, for example to use your geolocation information from your mobile device to geotag a post. We may use location information to improve and personalize the Services for you, for example by showing you relevant local content.\n    Tumblr may determine your location by using drone technology and live video feeds. Ha ha, no, we just check out your IP address or any location data you attach to a post. Normal stuff.Information Related to Your Mobile Device: We may collect and store information related to your mobile device. In some cases, we, or Yahoo (who we use for mobile analytics and other services), may receive, generate, or assign your mobile device a unique identifier for the purposes described above in \u201cInformation Related to Use of the Services.\u201d We may also ask you to provide your phone number to enable new products and improve the Services, such as by enabling multi-factor authentication for Account login. We will always ask you whether it\u2019s OK for us to collect and store your phone number.\nInformation Collected Using Cookies and Web Tags: Cookies are text files that may be sent to and saved by your web browser when you access a website; your web browser stores these cookies in a way associated with each website you visit, and you can generally see your cookies through your browser settings, depending on what browser you\u2019re using. A web tag is code or a pixel embedded in a web page, or email, that allows Tumblr or a third party to see that you have looked at that page. We use cookies and web tags to enable our servers to recognize your web browser and tell us how and when you use the Services, as described above in \u201cInformation Related to Use of the Services.\u201d Our cookies do not, by themselves, contain information that personally identifies you, and we don't combine the general information collected through cookies with other such information to tell us who you are. However, we do use cookies to identify that you have logged in, and that your web browser has accessed the Services, and we may associate that information with your Account if you have one. We may also store unique or near-unique identifiers that we associate with your Account in our cookies. This information, in turn, is sometimes used as described above in \u201cInformation Related to Use of the Services.\u201d Most web browsers have an option for turning off the cookie feature, which will prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, as well as (depending on the sophistication of your web browser) allowing you to decide on acceptance of each new cookie in a variety of ways. If you disable cookies, you won't be able to log into your Account, and so won\u2019t be able to use the vast majority of our Services; as such, we don't recommend disabling your cookies when using the Services. Some services that we use (including Third Party Services), such as Google Analytics, use web tags and may also place their own cookies on your browser, and individual blogs on our network may contain code that places their own cookies. We also run limited-time studies using web tags, sometimes with third parties, to, for example, measure the effectiveness of our advertising or email. Note that, unless otherwise disclosed, this Privacy Policy covers our use of cookies only and does not cover the use of cookies by third parties.\n    Being able to log into your account is one of Tumblr\u2019s many great features. Cookies make this possible. Cookies and web tags also let us learn how people use Tumblr, which in turn helps us make a better product for you to use.Information About Your Contacts: Certain features of the Services allow you to provide us with your contact lists, so that we can connect you with people in our Services that are also on those contact lists. For example, you can temporarily connect your email contact information to your Account, so that we can provide you with a list of your email contacts that use the Services. As another example, you can send us your mobile phone contact information through our mobile applications, which then allows us to provide you with a list of those contacts that use the Services so that you can \u201cfollow\u201d their blogs. We will give you a choice as to whether or not you provide us such information, and we will disclose fully, within the appropriate feature, how we use that information.\n    We won\u2019t look at (or be able to look at) your contact list unless you ask us to. Why would you ask us to? Because that\u2019s how you would find out if any of your contacts are on Tumblr. We discard this information immediately afterward.Derived Information: As described above in \u201cNative Actions\u201d and \u201cInformation Related to Use of the Services,\u201d we analyze your actions on the Services in order to derive or infer characteristics that may be descriptive of your Account (for example, what kinds of blogs you follow or what kinds of posts you view, like, or reblog). We use this information for all of the purposes set forth in \u201cInformation Related to Use of the Services,\u201d above.\n    In order to provide you with all of this Tumblr content for free, Tumblr selectively runs advertisements. We, and our parent company, Oath, work with online advertising companies to provide you with advertising that is as relevant and useful as possible. To make our ads more relevant and useful, we make educated guesses about your interests based on your activity on our sites and services. The ads we show you often reflect these interests and educated guesses.\n    You can read more about our parent company Oath and its advertising partners here.\n    And to learn more about how we select the ads you see, you can check out Tumblr\u2019s Advertising and affiliate policies and Oath\u2019s privacy and advertising practices.\nManaging your choices for personalized advertising experiences: If you do not prefer personalized advertising experiences, you may opt-out. Note that if you opt-out you will continue to see advertisements on Tumblr, though they will be less relevant and useful to you.\n    When using web-based versions of Tumblr, you may opt-out of interest-based or personalized advertising by using the following industry opt-out pages:\n---(EU) European Interactive Digital Advertising Alliance (EDAA) - www.youronlinechoices.com---(US) Network Advertising Initiative (NAI) - www.networkadvertising.org---(US) Digital Advertising Alliance (DAA) - www.aboutads.info---(Japan) Data Driven Advertising Initiative (DDAI) - www.ddai.info\n    These industry advertising organizations offer web browser-based tools for limiting the use of your web viewing data for interest-based or personalized advertising. Any choices made via these industry tools will only apply to the web browser in use for the choices made. These advertising choices are not propagated among all of your devices.\n    When using the mobile app version of Tumblr on Apple iOS devices you can opt out of personalized advertising by selecting \"Limit Ad Tracking\" in the iOS settings. For more information about these iOS options:\n---Open Settings;---Select Privacy; and---Select Advertising and follow the on-screen instructions.\n    When using the mobile app version of Tumblr on Android devices you can opt-out of personalized advertising by selecting \"Opt out of Interest Based Ads\u201d in Google settings. For more information about these Android options:\n---Open Settings;---Select Google;---Select Privacy; and---Select Ads and follow the on-screen instructions.\n    We never share information we receive from you unless: (a) we have your permission to share that information; (b) we have given you prior notice that the information will be shared, and with whom (such as in this Privacy Policy); or (c) that information is aggregate information or other information that does not identify you.\nInformation Shared with and Received from our Corporate Parents: We are a wholly-owned subsidiary of Yahoo, which is now part of Oath, a digital and mobile media company with more than 50 brands globally, and a member of the Verizon family of companies. Because we are a wholly-owned subsidiary, Yahoo and the rest of our family of companies may receive any information we do, and may share information they have with us. Our family of companies may use the information they receive from us to help us provide, understand, and improve the Services (including by providing us analytics) and in connection with their products and services (including by providing you with a more personalized experience). For details about how Yahoo treats the information it collects, please review Yahoo\u2019s Privacy Policy, and for the Verizon family of companies please review its Privacy Policy.\n    Yahoo owns us and we share with it and our Verizon family of companies.Information Shared with the Public Through the Services: As noted in \u201cUser Content\u201d and \u201cNative Actions,\u201d above, by default, content published through the Services and many actions you take on the Services are shared with the public. Because this kind of information can be seen by anyone and may be indexed by search engines (like Google Search, or the far superior Yahoo Search), you should be careful about what you choose to disclose publicly and make sure it\u2019s information you want to share with everyone.\n    The content you create on Tumblr is, by default, public. This means that anyone can see it, and that search engines can index it. If these things bother you, take a look at some of the additional privacy features we offer.Information Shared Between the Services: We may, if possible, aggregate information about your use of multiple Services and use that consolidated information to enhance and improve the Services, and to develop new Services.\nInformation You Share with Third Party Services: You may access Third Party Services through the Services, for example by clicking on externally-pointing links. You may also choose to share information that you provide to us, like blog posts, with those Third Party Services (for example, by sharing posts to Twitter or Facebook). This Privacy Policy only governs information we collect and you are responsible for reading and understanding those Third Party Services' privacy policies.\n    You can automatically publish the posts you make on Tumblr to other sites (like Facebook or Twitter). That\u2019s where our Privacy Policy ends and their policies begin. Make sure you\u2019re cool with the policies of any services you\u2019re considering sharing to before connecting them to your Tumblr account.Information Shared with Our Agents in Order to Operate and Improve the Services: In some cases, we share information that we store (such as IP Addresses) with third parties, such as service providers, consultants, and other agents (\"Agents\"), for the purposes of operating, enhancing, and improving the Services, and developing new products and services. For example, we may share information with service providers in order to fight spam, and third-party consultants may have access to information in the process of improving our processes and technology. Agents with whom we share such information for these reasons are generally bound by confidentiality obligations and, unless we tell you differently, our Agents do not have any right to use information we share with them beyond the scope and duration of what is necessary to assist us.\nInformation Disclosed Pursuant to Business Transfers: In some cases, we may choose to buy or sell business assets. In these transactions, user information is typically one of the transferred business assets. Moreover, if we, or substantially all of our assets, were acquired, or if we go out of business or enter bankruptcy, user information would be one of the assets that is transferred or acquired by a third party. You acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and that any acquirer of us or our assets may continue to use your Personal Information as set forth in this policy.\n    Should we happen to get acquired (again!) or go out of business (no way), the transfer of assets from us to our buyer may very well include user information. They are allowed to use it only in the ways outlined here, in the Privacy Policy you are reading right now.Information Disclosed for Our Protection and the Protection of Others: We believe in freedom of expression, and, to the extent reasonable, we try to protect our community from baseless legal demands. That said, we also reserve the right to access, preserve, and disclose any information as we reasonably believe is necessary, in our sole discretion, to (i) satisfy any law, regulation, legal process, governmental request, or governmental order, (ii) enforce this Privacy Policy and our Terms of Service, including investigation of potential violations hereof, (iii) detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security, trust and safety, or technical issues (including exchanging information with other companies and organizations for the purposes of improving security and preventing fraud, spam, and malware), (iv) respond to user support requests, or (v) protect the rights, property, health or safety of us, our users, any third parties or the public in general, including but not limited to situations involving possible violence, suicide, or self-harm.\n    Don\u2019t make us narc on you. We don\u2019t want to. But we do need to protect everyone who uses Tumblr from harming us, each other, or themselves. We work hard to balance privacy and community, and we\u2019re sure you can appreciate the challenges in that, and the seriousness with which we take those challenges.Information We Share with Your Consent or at Your Request: If you ask us to release information that we have about your Account, we will do so if reasonable and not unduly burdensome.\nInformation Shared with Other Third Parties: We may share or disclose non-private information, Aggregate Information, or other non-personally identifying information with people and entities that we do business with.\n    Your Account Information is protected by a password for your privacy and security. We may enable additional security features in the future, like multi-factor authentication. You need to prevent unauthorized access to your Account and information by creating a unique, secure, and protected password and limiting access to your computer and browser by signing off after you have finished accessing your Account on the Services.\n    We seek to protect your information (including your Account Information) to ensure that it is kept private; however, we can't guarantee the security of any information. Unauthorized entry or use, hardware or software failure, and other factors may compromise the security of user information at any time.\n    It\u2019s really important that you have a unique password for all of your accounts on the internet, including your Tumblr account. If you have trouble remembering passwords then you might consider using a service like 1Password or LastPass.\n    Tumblr will retain your information only for as long as is necessary for the purposes set out in this Privacy Policy, for as long as your Tumblr account is active or as needed to provide you with the Services. Please note that this applies to information in Tumblr group chats as well. Even though Tumblr only makes group chat messages available to the public (i.e., the other chat participants) for a short amount of time before their expiration and deletion from public view, group chat messages and related information (e.g., list of chat participants) will be retained by Tumblr for internal purpose (e.g., security audits), and/or as required by law (e.g., pursuant to a litigation hold notice) after they have disappeared from public view.  If you no longer want Tumblr to use your information to provide you with the Services, you may close your account and Tumblr will delete the information it holds about you unless we need to retain and use your information to comply with our legal obligations, to resolve disputes, to enforce our agreements or as otherwise permitted by law.\n    If you are a registered user, you can access most information associated with your Account by logging into the Services and checking your Account Settings page. Registered and unregistered users can access and delete cookies through their web browser settings.\n    If you want to delete your Account, you can do so from your Account Settings page or by emailing us and providing proof of authority over the Account. What constitutes \"proof of authority\" will vary depending on the circumstances, but generally will require sufficient identifying information so that we can be confident you are the Account owner. Deleting your Account may not fully remove the content you have published from our systems, as caching of, backups of, copies of, or references to your Account Information may not be immediately removed. In addition, given the nature of sharing on the Services, some of the public activity on your Account prior to deletion (such as reblogs of your blog posts) may remain stored on our servers and accessible to the public.\n    \n            You\u2019ll do great things on Tumblr, surely, but if it ever comes time to say goodbye, then you\u2019re free to delete your account at any time and for any reason. The deletion will be effective immediately, for the most part, but it might take a little while to scrub everything from our archives and backups.\n        \n            What won\u2019t get scrubbed are Reblogs of your posts. Those will remain on whatever blog reblogged them. Like we said before, it can be really, really hard to delete something once it goes out onto the internet, so be sure you\u2019re only publishing stuff that you\u2019re certain you want to publish.\n        \n    We may amend this Privacy Policy from time to time, using the process for modifications set forth in our Terms of Service. Use of information we collect is subject to the Privacy Policy in effect at the time such information is collected.\n    If you have any questions or concerns regarding privacy using the Services, send us a detailed message.\n    You will find a link to prior versions of our Privacy Policy below. We have stored these versions on GitHub, which will also allow you to compare different versions and see what terms have changed:\n    https://github.com/tumblr/policy/commits/master/privacy-policy.txt\n", "https://www.tumblr.com/policy/en/terms-of-service": "   Tumblr                          Tumblr is a U.S. company and subject to U.S. laws and jurisdiction. The original version of these Terms of Service (and any other terms, policies, or guidelines that we provide to you) are written in English. To the extent any translated version of these Terms of Service (or any other terms, policies, or guidelines that we provide to you) conflicts with the English version, the English version controls.\n    \n        THESE TERMS OF SERVICE CONTAIN LIMITATIONS OF TUMBLR'S LIABILITY IN\n        SECTION 14.\n    \n    Hello! Welcome to Tumblr\u2019s Terms of Service. Please read this carefully\n    before using our site, services, or products. This is a contract between\n    you and Tumblr. We've also included several annotations that aren't a part\n    of the contract itself, but are intended to emphasize key sections and help\n    you follow the text. We\u2019ve tried to be fair and straightforward. Please\n    feel free to contact us if you\n    have any questions or suggestions!\n    Please read these Terms of Service and our Community Guidelines\n    (collectively, the \"Agreement\") carefully before using\n    tumblr.com (the \"Site\") and/or the other domains,\n    websites, products, applications, mobile applications, services, and/or\n    Content provided by Tumblr, Inc. (all of those collectively with the Site,\n    the \"Services\") (Tumblr, Inc., a Delaware corporation and\n    wholly-owned subsidiary of Oath Inc., a Delaware corporation (\"    Oath\"), collectively with its agents, representatives,\n    consultants, employees, officers, and directors, \"Tumblr,\"\n    \"we,\" or \"us\"). By using or accessing the\n    Services, you (\"Subscriber\" or \"you\")\n    agree to be bound by all the terms and conditions of this Agreement. If you\n    don\u2019t agree to all the terms and conditions of this Agreement, you\n    shouldn't, and aren't permitted to, use the Services. Tumblr\u2019s personalized\n    Services cannot be provided and the terms of this Agreement cannot be\n    performed without Tumblr processing information about you and other users.\n    Processing of the information you share with Tumblr is essential to the\n    personalized Services which we provide and which you expect, including\n    personalized Content (as described below) and ads, and is a necessary part\n    of our performance of the agreement we have with you.\n    We\u2019re just letting you know, here, that Tumblr is now part of Oath, a\n    digital and mobile media company with more than 50    brands globally, and a\n    member of the Verizon family of companies, and these\n    \n        Terms of Service\n    \n    , which apply to your use of Tumblr, have been updated to reflect this\n    change. This section also includes an agreement where you're agreeing to\n    agree to the terms of this Agreement.\n    Tumblr reserves the right to modify this Agreement by (1) posting a revised\n    Agreement on and/or through the Services and (2) providing notice to you\n    that this Agreement has changed, generally via email where practicable, and\n    otherwise through the Services (such as through a notification on your\n    Tumblr Dashboard or in our mobile applications). Modifications will not\n    apply retroactively. You are responsible for reviewing and becoming\n    familiar with any modifications to this Agreement.\n    We may sometimes ask you to review and to explicitly agree to (or reject) a\n    revised version of this Agreement. In such cases, modifications will be\n    effective at the time of your agreement to the modified version of this\n    Agreement. If you do not agree at that time, you are not permitted to use\n    the Services.\n    In cases where we do not ask for your explicit agreement to a modified\n    version of this Agreement, but otherwise provide notice as set forth above,\n    the modified version of this Agreement will become effective fourteen days\n    after we have posted the modified Agreement and provided you notification\n    of the modifications. Your use of the Services following that period\n    constitutes your acceptance of the terms and conditions of this Agreement\n    as modified. If you do not agree to the modifications, you are not\n    permitted to use, and should discontinue your use of, the Services.\n    Note that, if you have prepaid for any Paid Services (as defined below)\n    prior to a modification of this Agreement, your use of such prepaid Paid\n    Services is governed by the version of this Agreement in effect at the time\n    Tumblr received your prepayment.\n    As Tumblr grows and improves, we might have to make changes to these Terms\n    of Service. When we do, we'll let you know. We're also going to make it a\n    practice to post old versions so it's easy to see\n    changes/additions/deletions. To see old versions, scroll down to the end of\n    this document.\nEligibility:\n    You  may not use the Services, provide any personal information to Tumblr,\n    or otherwise submit personal information through the Services (including,\n    for example, a name, address, telephone number, or email address) if you\n    are under the Minimum Age. The Minimum Age is (i) thirteen (13), or (ii)\n    for users in the European Union, sixteen (16) (or the lower age that your\n    country has provided for you to consent to the processing of your personal\n    data) . You may only use the Services if you can form a binding contract\n    with Tumblr and are not legally prohibited from using the Services.\n    You have to be the Minimum Age to use Tumblr. We're serious: it's a hard\n    rule. \u201cBut I\u2019m, like, almost old enough!\u201d you plead. Nope, sorry. If\n    you're not old enough, don't use Tumblr. Ask your parents for a\n    Playstation 4, or try books.\nService Changes and Limitations:\n    The Services change frequently, and their form and functionality may change\n    without prior notice to you. Tumblr retains the right to create limits on\n    and related to use of the Services in its sole discretion at any time with\n    or without notice. Tumblr may also impose limits on certain Services or\n    aspects of those Services or restrict your access to parts or all of the\n    Services without notice or liability. Tumblr may change, suspend, or\n    discontinue any or all of the Services at any time, including the\n    availability of any product, feature, database, or Content (as defined\n    below). Tumblr may also terminate or suspend Accounts (as defined below) at\n    any time, in its sole discretion.\n    Tumblr is an ever-evolving platform. With new products, services, and\n    features launching all the time, we need flexibility to make changes,\n    impose limits, and occasionally suspend or terminate certain offerings\n    (like features that flop). We can also terminate or suspend any account at\n    any time. That sounds harsh, but we only use that power when we have a\n    reason, as outlined in these Terms of Service, our\n    \n        Privacy Policy\n    \n    , and our    Community Guidelines.\nLimitations on Automated Use:\n    You may not, without express prior written permission, do any of the\n    following while accessing or using the Services: (a) tamper with, or use\n    non-public areas of the Services, or the computer or delivery systems of\n    Tumblr and/or its service providers; (b) probe, scan, or test any system or\n    network (particularly for vulnerabilities), or otherwise attempt to breach\n    or circumvent any security or authentication measures; (c) access or search\n    or attempt to access or search the Services by any means (automated or\n    otherwise) other than through our currently available, published interfaces\n    that are provided by Tumblr (and only pursuant to those terms and\n    conditions) or unless permitted by Tumblr's robots.txt file or other robot\n    exclusion mechanisms; (d) scrape the Services, and particularly scrape\n    Content (as defined below) from the Services; (e) use the Services to send\n    altered, deceptive, or false source-identifying information, including\n    without limitation by forging TCP-IP packet headers or email headers; or\n    (f) interfere with, or disrupt, (or attempt to do so), the access of any\n    Subscriber, host or network, including, without limitation, by sending a\n    virus to, spamming, or overloading the Services, or by scripted use of the\n    Services in such a manner as to interfere with or create an undue burden on\n    the Services.\n    Don't do bad things to Tumblr or to other users. Some particularly\n    egregious examples of \"bad things\" are listed in this section.\n    As a condition to using certain of the Services and in order for us to\n    provide them to you, you may be required to create an account (an \"    Account\"), provide your age and an email address and\n    select a password and Tumblr username, which will serve as a default link\n    to your default Tumblr blog of the form [username].tumblr.com (a \"    Tumblr URL\"). You must select a different Tumblr URL for\n    each new blog you create.\n    You agree to provide Tumblr with accurate, complete, and updated\n    registration information, particularly your email address.\n    It's really important that the email address associated with your Tumblr\n    account is accurate and up-to-date. If you ever forget your password - or\n    worse, fall victim to a malicious phishing attack - a working email address\n    is often the only way for us to recover your account.\n    You are also responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your\n    Account password and for the security of your Account, and you will notify\n    Tumblr immediately of any actual or suspected loss, theft, or unauthorized\n    use of your Account or Account password.\n    For information about how Tumblr collects, uses, and shares your\n    information, please review our\n    \n        Privacy Policy\n    \n    . By using the Services you agree you have read the Privacy Policy, which\n    describes our collection, use, and sharing (as set forth in the Privacy\n    Policy) of such information, including the transfer of this information to\n    the United States and/or other countries for storage, processing, and use\n    by Tumblr and the Tumblr Affiliates (as defined below).\nDefinitions:\n    For purposes of this Agreement: (1) the term \"Content\"\n    means a creative expression and includes, without limitation, video, audio,\n    photographs, images, illustrations, animations, logos, tools, written\n    posts, replies, comments, information, data, text, software, scripts,\n    executable files, graphics, Themes (as defined below), and interactive\n    features, any of which may be generated, provided, or otherwise made\n    accessible on or through the Services; (2) the term \"    Subscriber Content\" means Content that a Subscriber\n    submits, transfers, or otherwise provides to the Services. Content\n    includes, without limitation, all Subscriber Content.\nYour Rights in Subscriber Content:\n    Subscribers retain ownership and/or other applicable rights in Subscriber\n    Content, and Tumblr and/or third parties retain ownership and/or other\n    applicable rights in all Content other than Subscriber Content.\n    You retain ownership you have of any intellectual property you post to\n    Tumblr.\nSubscriber Content License to Tumblr:\n    When you provide Subscriber Content to Tumblr through the Services, you\n    grant Tumblr a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free, sublicensable,\n    transferable right and license to use, host, store, cache, reproduce,\n    publish, display (publicly or otherwise), perform (publicly or otherwise),\n    distribute, transmit, modify, adapt (including, without limitation, in\n    order to conform it to the requirements of any networks, devices, services,\n    or media through which the Services are available), and create derivative\n    works of, such Subscriber Content. The rights you grant in this license are\n    for the limited purposes of allowing Tumblr to operate the Services in\n    accordance with their functionality, improve and promote the Services, and\n    develop new Services. The reference in this license to \"creat[ing]\n    derivative works\" is not intended to give Tumblr a right to make\n    substantive editorial changes or derivations, but does, for example, enable    reblogging, which allows Tumblr Subscribers to\n    redistribute Subscriber Content from one Tumblr blog to another in a manner\n    that allows them to add their own text or other Content before or after\n    your Subscriber Content.\n    When you upload your creations to Tumblr, you\u2019re giving us permission to\n    make them available in all the ways you would expect us to (for example,\n    via your blog, RSS, the Tumblr Dashboard, etc.). We never want to do\n    anything with your work that surprises you.\n    Something else worth noting: Countless Tumblr blogs have gone on to spawn\n    books, films, albums, brands, and more. Any royalties or reimbursement you\n    get for your creations are, needless to say, entirely yours. It's your\n    work, and we're proud to be a part (however small) of what you accomplish.\n    You also agree that this license includes the right for Tumblr to make all\n    publicly-posted Content available to third parties selected by Tumblr, so\n    that those third parties can syndicate and/or analyze such Content on other\n    media and services.\n    An example of what it means to \"make all publicly-posted Content available\"\n    to a Tumblr partner for distribution or analysis would be licensing the\n    Tumblr \"firehose,\" a live feed of all public activity on Tumblr, to\n    partners like search engines.\n    Note also that this license to your Subscriber Content continues even if\n    you stop using the Services, primarily because of the social nature of\n    Content shared through Tumblr\u2019s Services - when you post something\n    publicly, others may choose to comment on it, making your Content part of a\n    social conversation that can\u2019t later be erased without retroactively\n    censoring the speech of others.\n    One thing you should consider before posting: When you make something\n    publicly available on the Internet, it becomes practically impossible to\n    take down all copies of it.\n    You also agree that you will respect the intellectual property rights of\n    others, and represent and warrant that you have all of the necessary rights\n    to grant us this license for all Subscriber Content you transfer to us.\n    Tumblr may add its own affiliate code to links posted on Tumblr at its\n    discretion, provided a user has not previously included their own affiliate\n    code into the applicable link. Users may opt out of this functionality    here.\nContent License to You:\n    As a Subscriber of the Services, Tumblr grants you a worldwide, revocable,\n    non-exclusive, non-sublicensable, and non-transferable license to download,\n    store, view, display, perform, redistribute, and create derivative works of\n    Content solely in connection with your use of, and in strict accordance\n    with the functionality and restrictions of, the Services (including,\n    without limitation, Paid Services, as defined below). This means, for\n    example, that we license Content to you for purposes of reblogging.\nCompliance with Community Guidelines:\n    You agree that you won't violate Tumblr's    Community Guidelines.\nTermination and Deletion:\n    On termination of your Account, or upon your deletion of particular pieces\n    of Subscriber Content from the Services, Tumblr shall make reasonable\n    efforts to make such Subscriber Content inaccessible and cease use of it\n    and, if required by the applicable Privacy Policy, delete your Account data\n    and / or Subscriber Content unless permitted or required to keep this data\n    in accordance with law; however, you acknowledge and agree that: (a)\n    deleted Subscriber Content may persist in caches or backups for a\n    reasonable period of time and (b) copies of or references to the Subscriber\n    Content may not be entirely removed (due to the nature of reblogging, for\n    example). You can delete your account at any time    here.\n    If you develop software or services based on the Services or any Content,\n    whether using the\n    \n        Tumblr Application Programming Interface\n    \n    or not, you will agree to and comply with the\n    \n        Tumblr Application Developer and API License Agreement\n    \n    .\n    Any use of Tumblr's trademarks, branding, logos, and other such assets in\n    connection with the Services shall use    Tumblr\u2019s approved branding and\n    shall be in accordance with the\n    \n        Tumblr Trademark Guidelines\n    \n    .\n    Tumblr makes available specialized HTML and CSS code (\"    Tumblr Template Code\") for the design and layout of blog\n    pages available for use on some of the Services (\"Themes\n    \"). Certain Themes are available for purchase as a Paid Service (as defined\n    below) (such Themes, \"Premium Themes\"). Purchased Premium\n    Themes may not be transferred between Accounts, between blogs, or between\n    Services on a single Account and are subject to the payment terms herein.\n    Tumblr grants you a license to customize the Tumblr Template Code to create\n    your own Themes for use on your blog page (each a \"    Custom Theme\"). If you choose, you may also contribute\n    your Custom Themes for use by other Subscribers as Subscriber Content.\n    However, as a condition of this license allowing you to create Custom\n    Themes, you agree that you won't distribute such Custom Themes from\n    locations other than Tumblr-owned or approved websites without our\n    permission, as set out in our    Community Guidelines.\n    Note also that other Subscribers may use your Custom Themes after you have\n    removed them from distribution, and you hereby grant those Subscribers an\n    irrevocable license to use those Custom Themes as contributed by you. In\n    other words, you can remove and stop distribution of your Custom Themes,\n    but Subscribers who are already using them can keep using them.\n    To develop and distribute Custom Themes that are Premium Themes, please    contact us.\n    Some of the Services require payment of fees (the \"    Paid Services,\" including without limitation Premium\n    Themes). All fees are stated in United States dollars. You shall pay all\n    applicable fees, as described in the applicable Services, in connection\n    with such Services, and any related taxes or additional charges.\n    Paid Services are limited licenses for you to use particular for-pay\n    aspects of the Services. Usage of terms like sell, sale, buy, purchase, or\n    similar terms all refer to your acquisition of a license to use Paid\n    Services, and do not represent any transfer of any right, title, or\n    ownership interest of any kind. You may not relicense, resell, transfer, or\n    exchange Paid Services within or outside of the Services, except as\n    expressly allowed by the rules of those Paid Services.\n    Tumblr may, in its sole discretion, modify the functionality of, or\n    eliminate, Paid Services, or the terms and conditions under which Paid\n    Services are provided.\n    Purchases of Paid Services are final and non-refundable (particularly those\n    Paid Services that may be used immediately, such as Promotions, as defined\n    below), except at Tumblr's sole discretion and in accordance with the rules\n    governing each Paid Service. Termination of your Account or your rights\n    under this Agreement may result in forfeiture of purchased Paid Services.\n    For example, if your Account is suspended, you forfeit your license to any\n    Premium Themes you have purchased.\n    Tumblr may change its prices for Paid Services at any time. To the extent\n    applicable, Tumblr will provide you reasonable notice of any such pricing\n    changes by posting the new prices on or through the applicable Paid Service\n    and/or by sending you an email notification. If you do not wish to pay the\n    new prices, you may choose not to purchase, or to cancel, the applicable\n    Paid Service prior to the change going into effect.\n    Some features of the Services may allow you to promote yourself to other\n    Subscribers, and some of these features may be Paid Services (\"    Promotions\").\n    The following additional terms apply to Promotions:\n    Things that you promote will comply with this Agreement; if they don't,\n    Tumblr reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to cancel a Promotion\n    without refund or recourse to you.\n    Tumblr may remove or disable any Promotion for any reason in its sole\n    discretion.\n    Unless otherwise specified, Tumblr does not guarantee any activity that\n    Promotions may receive, including but not limited to clicks, Likes, and\n    Reblogs. Tumblr cannot control how Subscribers interact with Promotions and\n    is not responsible for \"click fraud\" or other fraudulent actions by third\n    parties, including, without limitation, Subscribers. Tumblr doesn't\n    guarantee that its reporting related to Promotions will be accurate or\n    complete, nor does it guarantee that Promotions will behave in a particular\n    manner, and Tumblr shall not be liable to you or responsible for any\n    erroneous reporting about or errant behavior of or related to Promotions\n    (e.g., any errors in how Likes or Reblogs are counted).\n    Promotions may allow targeting to some Subscriber characteristics. Tumblr\n    does not guarantee that any particular Promotion will reach a particular\n    sort of individual in all cases.\n    You can cancel certain Promotions at any time depending on their\n    functionality, but you are responsible for paying for Promotions at least\n    to the extent they have already been used or distributed through the\n    Services.\n    By submitting a Promotion, you license Tumblr to run that Promotion for as\n    long as you have specified, which, depending on the Promotion, may be\n    perpetually. This license ends when the Promotion has been completed or\n    cancelled, but it may take up to forty eight (48) hours for a Promotion to\n    stop being reflected on the Services.\n    Your access to and use of the Services or any Content is at your own risk.\n    YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT THE SERVICES ARE PROVIDED TO YOU ON AN \"AS\n    IS\" AND \"AS AVAILABLE\" BASIS.

Tumblr may terminate or suspend your access to or ability to\n    use any and all Services immediately, without prior notice or liability,\n    for any reason or no reason, including but not limited to if you breach any\n    of the terms or conditions of this Agreement. In particular, Tumblr may\n    immediately terminate or suspend Accounts that have been flagged for repeat\n    copyright infringement.\n    Upon termination of your access to or ability to use a Service, including\n    but not limited to suspension of your Account on a Service, your right to\n    use or access that Service and any Content will immediately cease. All provisions\n    of this Agreement that by their nature should survive termination shall\n    survive termination, including, without limitation, ownership provisions,\n    warranty disclaimers, and limitations of liability. Termination of your\n    access to and use of the Services shall not relieve you of any obligations\n    arising or accruing prior to such termination or limit any liability that\n    you otherwise may have to Tumblr or any third party and shall not relieve\n    you of your rights if you are a user in the European Economic Area which\n    are described in the Privacy Policy.\n    You and Tumblr agree that we will resolve any claim or controversy at law\n    or equity that arises out of this Agreement or the Services in accordance\n    with this Section or as you and Tumblr otherwise agree in writing.

You agree that any claim or dispute you may\n    have against Tumblr must be resolved exclusively by a state or federal\n    court located in New York County, New York, except as otherwise agreed by\n    the parties. You agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of the courts\n    located within New York County, New York for the purpose of litigating all\n    such claims or disputes.\n    If you are (a) a United States federal, state, or local government agency\n    or body, (b) using the Services in your official capacity, and (c) legally\n    unable to accept the clauses in this Section, then this Section doesn\u2019t\n    apply to you. For such entities, this Agreement and any related action will\n    be governed by the laws of the United States of America, without regard to\n    conflict of law provisions, and, in the absence of federal law and to the\n    extent permitted under federal law, the laws of the State of New York,\n    excluding choice of law.\n    This Agreement, as modified from time to time, constitutes the entire\n    agreement between you and Tumblr with respect to the subject matter hereof.\n    This Agreement replaces all prior or contemporaneous understandings or\n    agreements, written or oral, regarding the subject matter hereof and\n    constitutes the entire and exclusive agreement between the parties. The\n    failure of either party to exercise, in any way, any right provided for\n    herein shall not be deemed a waiver of any further rights hereunder. If any\n    provision of this Agreement is found to be unenforceable or invalid, that\n    provision shall be limited or eliminated to the minimum extent necessary so\n    that this Agreement shall otherwise remain enforceable and in full force\n    and effect. This Agreement is not assignable, transferable, or\n    sublicensable by you except with Tumblr's prior written consent. Tumblr may\n    assign this Agreement in whole or in part at any time without your consent.\n    No agency, partnership, joint controllership, joint venture, or employment\n    is created as a result of this Agreement and you do not have any authority\n    of any kind to bind Tumblr in any respect whatsoever.

Tumblr's servers\n    and operations are, however, located in the United States, and Tumblr's\n    policies and procedures are based on United States law. As such, the\n    following provisions apply specifically to Subscribers located outside of\n    the United States: (1) you acknowledge that we will transfer, store, and\n    process your information, including but not limited to Subscriber Content\n    and any personal information, in the United States and/or other countries\n    in order to provide you with the Services and perform this Agreement; and\n    (2) if you are using the Services from a country embargoed by the United\n    States, or are on the United States Treasury Department's list of\n    \"Specially Designated Nationals,\" you agree that you will not engage in\n    financial transactions, or conduct any commercial activities using or\n    through the Services (for example, purchasing Premium Themes).\nSubmit an infringement notice\n    Tumblr has adopted the following policy toward copyright infringement on\n    the Services in accordance with the\n    \n        Digital Millennium Copyright Act\n    \n    (the \"DMCA\"). The address of Tumblr's Designated Agent for\n    copyright takedown notices (\"Designated Agent\") is listed\n    below. You may submit a notice under the DMCA using our    copyright notice form.\nReporting Instances of Copyright Infringement:\n    If you believe that Content residing or accessible on or through the\n    Services infringes a copyright, please send a notice of copyright\n    infringement containing the following information to the Designated Agent\n    at the address below:\n    Identification of the work or material being infringed.\n    Identification of the material that is claimed to be infringing, including\n    its location, with sufficient detail so that Tumblr is capable of finding\n    it and verifying its existence.\n    Contact information for the notifying party (the \"Notifying Party\"),\n    including name, address, telephone number, and email address.\n    A statement that the Notifying Party has a good faith belief that the\n    material is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent or law.\n    A statement made under penalty of perjury that the information provided in\n    the notice is accurate and that the Notifying Party is authorized to make\n    the complaint on behalf of the copyright owner.\n    A physical or electronic signature of a person authorized to act on behalf\n    of the owner of the copyright that has been allegedly infringed.\n    Please also note that the information provided in a notice of copyright\n    infringement may be forwarded to the Subscriber who posted the allegedly\n    infringing content. After removing material pursuant to a valid DMCA\n    notice, Tumblr will immediately notify the Subscriber responsible for the\n    allegedly infringing material that it has removed or disabled access to the\n    material. Tumblr will terminate, under appropriate circumstances, the\n    Accounts of Subscribers who are repeat copyright infringers, and reserves\n    the right, in its sole discretion, to terminate any Subscriber for actual\n    or apparent copyright infringement.\nSubmitting a DMCA Counter-Notification:\n    If you believe you are the wrongful subject of a DMCA notification, you may\n    file a counter-notification with Tumblr by providing the following\n    information to the Designated Agent at the address below:\n    The specific URLs of material that Tumblr has removed or to which Tumblr\n    has disabled access.\n    Your name, address, telephone number, and email address.\n    A statement that you consent to the jurisdiction of Federal District Court\n    for the judicial district in which your address is located (or the federal\n    district courts located in New York County, New York if your address is\n    outside of the United States), and that you will accept service of process\n    from the person who provided the original DMCA notification or an agent of\n    such person.\n    The following statement: \"I swear, under penalty of perjury, that I have a\n    good faith belief that the material was removed or disabled as a result of\n    a mistake or misidentification of the material to be removed or disabled.\"\n    Your signature.\n    Upon receipt of a valid counter-notification, Tumblr will forward it to\n    Notifying Party who submitted the original DMCA notification. The original\n    Notifying Party (or the copyright holder he or she represents) will then\n    have ten (10) days to notify us that he or she has filed legal action\n    relating to the allegedly infringing material. If Tumblr does not receive\n    any such notification within ten (10) days, we may restore the material to\n    the Services.\nDesignated Agent\n    Tumblr, Inc.\n    \n    770 Broadway\n    \n    New York, NY 10003\n    Attn:\n    Copyright Agent\n    Fax:\n    +1 (646) 513-4321\n    Email:\n    dmca@tumblr.com\nCopyright notice form:https://www.tumblr.com/dmca\n    You can find disclosures related to our use of open source software\n    packages at the following locations:\n        https://www.tumblr.com/policy/ios-credits\n    \n        https://www.tumblr.com/policy/android-credits\n    \n        https://www.tumblr.com/policy/web-credits\n    Link to Prior Versions\n    You will find prior versions of our Terms of Service on GitHub, which will\n    allow you to compare historical versions and see which terms have been\n    updated.\n    https://github.com/tumblr/policy/commits/master/terms-of-service.txt\n"}, "twitter.com": {"https://twitter.com/en/privacy": "\nPrivacy Policy\n\u00a0\nTwitter is public and Tweets are immediately viewable and searchable by anyone around the world. We give you non-public ways to communicate on Twitter too, through protected Tweets and Direct Messages. You can also use Twitter under a pseudonym if you prefer not to use your name.\nWhen you use Twitter, even if you\u2019re just looking at Tweets, we receive some personal information from you like the type of device you\u2019re using and your IP address. You can choose to share additional information with us like your email address, phone number, address book contacts, and a public profile. We use this information for things like keeping your account secure and showing you more relevant Tweets, people to follow, events, and ads.\nWe give you control through your settings to limit the data we collect from you and how we use it, and to control things like account security, marketing preferences, apps that can access your account, and address book contacts you\u2019ve uploaded to Twitter. You can also always download the information you have shared on Twitter.\u00a0\nIn addition to information you share with us, we use your Tweets, content you\u2019ve read, Liked, or Retweeted, and other information to determine what topics you\u2019re interested in, your age, the languages you speak, and other signals to show you more relevant content.

If you do choose to create an account, you must provide us with some personal data so that we can provide our services to you. On Twitter this includes a display name (for example, \u201cTwitter Moments\u201d), a username (for example, @TwitterMoments), a password, and an email address or phone number. Your display name and username are always public, but you can use either your real name or a pseudonym.

You also may choose to publish your location in your Tweets or your Twitter profile. The lists you create, people you follow and who follow you, and Tweets you Like or Retweet are also public. Periscope broadcasts you create, click on, or otherwise engage with, either on Periscope or on Twitter, are public along with when you took those actions. So are your hearts, comments, the number of hearts you\u2019ve received, which accounts you are a Superfan of, and whether you watched a broadcast live or on replay. Any hearts, comments, or other content you contribute to another account\u2019s broadcast will remain part of that broadcast for as long as it remains on Periscope. Information posted about you by other people who use our services may also be public. For example, other people may tag you in a photo (if your settings allow) or mention you in a Tweet.\nYou are responsible for your Tweets and other information you provide through our services, and you should think carefully about what you make public, especially if it is sensitive information. If you update your public information on Twitter, such as by deleting a Tweet or deactivating your account, we will reflect your updated content on Twitter.com, Twitter for iOS, and Twitter for Android.\nIn addition to providing your public information to the world directly on Twitter, we also use technology like application programming interfaces (APIs) and embeds to make that information available to websites, apps, and others for their use - for example, displaying Tweets on a news website or analyzing what people say on Twitter. We generally make this content available in limited quantities for free and charge licensing fees for large-scale access. We have standard terms that govern how this data can be used, and a compliance program to enforce these terms.

If you provide us with your phone number, you agree to receive text messages from Twitter to that number as your country\u2019s laws allow.

For example, you can use Direct Messages to have non-public conversations on Twitter, protect your Tweets, or host private broadcasts on Periscope. When you communicate with others by sending or receiving Direct Messages, we will store and process your communications and information related to them. This includes link scanning for malicious content, link shortening to http://t.co URLs, detection of spam and prohibited images, and review of reported issues. We also use information about whom you have communicated with and when (but not the content of those communications) to better understand the use of our services, to protect the safety and integrity of our platform, and to show more relevant content. We share the content of your Direct Messages with the people you\u2019ve sent them to; we do not use them to serve you ads. Note that if you interact in a way that would ordinarily be public with Twitter content shared with you via Direct Message, for instance by liking a Tweet, those interactions will be public. When you use features like Direct Messages to communicate, remember that recipients have their own copy of your communications on Twitter - even if you delete your copy of those messages from your account - which they may duplicate, store, or re-share.\npageReference: /content/twitter-com/legal/en/privacy/chapter-1/chapter-1-4\nContent:\nSpam stinks\nWe scan your Direct Messages to try and prevent spam for you and on our service.\nClose tooltip\nJust like email\nOnly send Direct Messages to people you trust.

Although most web browsers automatically accept cookies, many browsers\u2019 settings can be set to decline cookies or alert you when a website is attempting to place a cookie on your computer. However, some of our services may not function properly if you disable cookies. When your browser or device allows it, we use both session cookies and persistent cookies to better understand how you interact with our services, to monitor aggregate usage patterns, and to personalize and otherwise operate our services such as by providing account security, personalizing the content we show you including ads, and remembering your language preferences. We do not support the Do Not Track browser option. You can learn more about how we use cookies and similar technologies here.\npageReference: /content/twitter-com/legal/en/privacy/chapter-2/chapter-2-3-tooltips---overlays\nContent:\nNot hungry?\nYou can change your cookie settings in your web browser.\nClose tooltip\n\u00a0\n2.4\nWe receive information when you view content on or otherwise interact with our services, which we refer to as \u201cLog Data,\u201d even if you have not created an account. For example, when you visit our websites, sign into our services, interact with our email notifications, use your account to authenticate to a third-party service, or visit a third-party service that includes Twitter content, we may receive information about you. This Log Data includes information such as your IP address, browser type, operating system, the referring web page, pages visited, location, your mobile carrier, device information (including device and application IDs), search terms, and cookie information. We also receive Log Data when you click on, view, or interact with links on our services, including when you install another application through Twitter. We use Log Data to operate our services and ensure their secure, reliable, and robust performance. For example, we use Log Data to protect the security of accounts and to determine what content is popular on our services. We also use this data to improve the content we show you, including ads.\nWe use information you provide to us and data we receive, including Log Data and data from third parties, to make inferences like what topics you may be interested in, how old you are, and what languages you speak. This helps us better design our services for you and personalize the content we show you, including ads.\npageReference: /content/twitter-com/legal/en/privacy/chapter-2/chapter-2-4-tooltips---overlays\nContent:\n          Close\n        \nUsing data like the Tweets and accounts you view on Twitter\u2026\n...Twitter can suggest relevant content you may also like.\n\u00a0\n2.5\nWhen you view our content on third-party websites\u00a0that integrate Twitter content such as embedded timelines or Tweet buttons, we may receive Log Data that includes the web page you visited. We use this information to better understand the use of our services, to protect the safety and integrity of our platform, and to show more relevant content, including ads. We do not associate this web browsing history with your name, email address, phone number, or username, and we delete, obfuscate, or aggregate it after no longer than 30 days. We do not collect this data from browsers that we believe to be located in the European Union or EFTA States.\npageReference: /content/twitter-com/legal/en/privacy/chapter-2/chapter-2-5-tooltips---overlays1\nContent:\n          Close\n        \nYou can see Twitter content on Twitter\u2019s website and apps - but many other websites also choose to include Twitter content.\n\u00a0\n2.6\nAdvertising revenue allows us to support and improve our services. We use the information described in this Privacy Policy to help make our advertising more relevant to you, to measure its effectiveness, and to help recognize your devices to serve you ads on and off of Twitter. Our ad partners and affiliates share information with us such as browser cookie IDs, mobile device IDs, hashed email addresses, demographic or interest data, and content viewed or actions taken on a website or app. Some of our ad partners, particularly our advertisers, also enable us to collect similar information directly from their website or app by integrating our advertising technology.\nTwitter adheres to the Digital Advertising Alliance Self-Regulatory Principles for Online Behavioral Advertising (also referred to as \u201cinterest-based advertising\u201d) and respects the DAA\u2019s consumer choice tool for you to opt out of interest-based advertising at https://optout.aboutads.info. In addition, our ads policies prohibit advertisers from targeting ads based on categories that we consider sensitive or are prohibited by law, such as race, religion, politics, sex life, or health. Learn more about your privacy options for interest-based ads here and about how ads work on our services here.\nIf you are an advertiser or a prospective advertiser, we process your personal data to help offer and provide our advertising services. You can update your data in your Twitter Ads dashboard or by contacting us directly as described in this Privacy Policy.\npageReference: /content/twitter-com/legal/en/privacy/chapter-2/chapter-2-6-tooltips---overlays\nContent:\n          Close\n        \nAdvertisers share information on Twitter\u2026\n...so that, if your settings allow, they can show their most relevant ads.\n\u00a0\n2.7\nIf you access our APIs or developer portal, we process your personal data to help provide our services. You can update your data by contacting us directly as described in this Privacy Policy.\n\u00a0\n2.8\nWe may receive information about you from third parties who are not our ad partners, such as others on Twitter, partners who help us evaluate the safety and quality of content on our platform, our corporate affiliates, and other services you link to your Twitter account.\nYou may choose to connect your Twitter account to accounts on another service, and that other service may send us information about your account on that service. We use the information we receive to provide you features like cross-posting or cross-service authentication, and to operate our services. For integrations that Twitter formally supports, you may revoke this permission at any time from your application settings; for other integrations, please visit the other service you have connected to Twitter.\n\u00a0\n2.9\nWhen you log into Twitter on a browser or device, we will associate that browser or device with your account for purposes such as authentication, security, and personalization. Subject to your settings, we may also associate your account with browsers or devices other than those you use to log into Twitter (or associate your logged-out device or browser with other browsers or devices). We do this to operate and personalize our services. For example, if you visit websites with sports content on your laptop, we may show you sports-related ads on Twitter for Android.\npageReference: /content/twitter-com/legal/en/privacy/chapter-2/chapter-2-9-tooltips---overlays\nContent:\n          Close\n        \nTo help make your Twitter experience better on one of your devices...\n...Twitter may use information from another device of yours.\n\u00a0\n2.10\nYour Twitter Personalization and data settings let you decide:\n---Whether we show you interest-based ads on and off Twitter\n---How we personalize your experience across devices\n---Whether we collect and use your precise location\n---Whether we personalize your experience based on where you\u2019ve been\n---Whether we keep track of the websites where you see Twitter content\nYou can use Your Twitter data to review:\n---Advertisers who have included you in tailored audiences to serve you ads\n---Demographic and interest data about your account from our ads partners\n---Information that Twitter has inferred about you such as your age range, gender, languages, and interests\nWe also provide a version of these tools on Twitter if you don\u2019t have a Twitter account, or if you\u2019re logged out of your account. This lets you see the data and settings for the logged out browser or device you are using, separate from any Twitter account that uses that browser or device. On Periscope, you can control whether we personalize your experience based on your watch history through your settings.\npageReference: /content/twitter-com/legal/en/privacy/chapter-2/chapter-2-10-tooltips---overlays\nContent:\n          Close\n        \nYou have options when it comes to what information you share and see on Twitter.\n\u00a0\n3\nAs noted above, Twitter is designed to broadly and instantly disseminate information you share publicly through our services. In the limited circumstances where we disclose your private personal data, we do so subject to your control, because it\u2019s necessary to operate our services, or because it\u2019s required by law.\n\u00a0\n3.1\nWe share or disclose your personal data with your consent or at your direction, such as when you authorize a third-party web client or application to access your account or when you direct us to share your feedback with a business. If you\u2019ve shared information like Direct Messages or protected Tweets with someone else who accesses Twitter through a third-party service, keep in mind that the information may be shared with the third-party service.\nSubject to your settings, we also provide certain third parties with personal data to help us offer or operate our services. For example, we share with advertisers the identifiers of devices that saw their ads, to enable them to measure the effectiveness of our advertising business. We also share device identifiers, along with the interests or other characteristics of a device or the person using it, to help partners decide whether to serve an ad to that device or to enable them to conduct marketing, brand analysis, interest-based advertising, or similar activities.\u00a0You can learn more about these partnerships in our Help Center, and you can control whether Twitter shares your personal data in this way by using the \u201cShare your data with Twitter\u2019s business partners\u201d option in your Personalization and Data settings. (This setting does not control sharing described elsewhere in our Privacy Policy, such as when we share data with our service providers.) The information we share with these partners does not include your name, email address, phone number, or Twitter username, but some of these partnerships allow the information we share to be linked to other personal information if the partner gets your consent first.\npageReference: /content/twitter-com/legal/en/privacy/chapter-3/chapter-3-1-tooltips---overlays\nContent:\n          Close\n        \nWhen you click on or view an ad on Twitter, if your settings allow, Twitter may send data about your device back to the advertiser to help them measure their success and improve future ads.\n\u00a0\n3.2\nWe engage service providers to perform functions and provide services to us in the United States, Ireland, and other countries. For example, we use a variety of third-party services to help operate our services, such as hosting our various blogs and wikis, and to help us understand the use of our services, such as Google Analytics. We may share your private personal data with such service providers subject to obligations consistent with this Privacy Policy and any other appropriate confidentiality and security measures, and on the condition that the third parties use your private personal data only on our behalf and pursuant to our instructions. We share your payment information with payment services providers to process payments; prevent, detect, and investigate fraud or other prohibited activities; facilitate dispute resolution such as chargebacks or refunds; and for other purposes associated with the acceptance of credit and debit cards.\n\u00a0\n3.3\nNotwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Privacy Policy or controls we may otherwise offer to you, we may preserve, use, or disclose your personal data if we believe that it is reasonably necessary to comply with a law, regulation, legal process, or governmental request; to protect the safety of any person; to protect the safety or integrity of our platform, including to help prevent spam, abuse, or malicious actors on our services, or to explain why we have removed content or accounts from our services; to address fraud, security, or technical issues; or to protect our rights or property or the rights or property of those who use our services. However, nothing in this Privacy Policy is intended to limit any legal defenses or objections that you may have to a third party\u2019s, including a government\u2019s, request to disclose your personal data.\npageReference: /content/twitter-com/legal/en/privacy/chapter-3/chapter-3-3-tooltips---overlays\nContent:\nTransparency matters\nWe remove content from our services when it violates our rules, like if it glorifies violence. When that content is gone, we want you to know.\nClose tooltip\n\u00a0\n3.4\nIn the event that we are involved in a bankruptcy, merger, acquisition, reorganization, or sale of assets, your personal data may be sold or transferred as part of that transaction. This Privacy Policy will apply to your personal data as transferred to the new entity. We may also disclose personal data about you to our corporate affiliates in order to help operate our services and our affiliates\u2019 services, including the delivery of ads.\n\u00a0\n3.5\nWe share or disclose non-personal data, such as aggregated information like the total number of times people engaged with a Tweet, the number of people who clicked on a particular link or voted on a poll in a Tweet (even if only one did), the topics that people are Tweeting about in a particular location, or reports to advertisers about how many people saw or clicked on their ads.\n\u00a0\n4\nYou control the personal data you share with us. You can access or rectify this data at any time. You can also deactivate your account. We also provide you tools to object, restrict, or withdraw consent where applicable for the use of data you have provided to Twitter. And we make the data you shared through our services portable and provide easy ways for you to contact us.\n\u00a0\n4.1\nIf you have registered an account on Twitter, we provide you with tools and account settings to access, correct, delete, or modify the personal data you provided to us and associated with your account. You can download certain account information, including your Tweets, by following the instructions here. On Periscope, you can request correction, deletion, or modification of your personal data, and download your account information, by following the instructions here. You can learn more about the interests we have inferred about you in Your Twitter Data and request access to additional information here.\n\u00a0\n4.2\nWe keep Log Data for a maximum of 18 months. If you follow the instructions here (or for Periscope here), your account will be deactivated and then deleted. When deactivated, your Twitter account, including your display name, username, and public profile, will no longer be viewable on Twitter.com, Twitter for iOS, and Twitter for Android. For up to 30 days after deactivation it is still possible to restore your Twitter account if it was accidentally or wrongfully deactivated.\nKeep in mind that search engines and other third parties may still retain copies of your public information, like your profile information and public Tweets, even after you have deleted the information from our services or deactivated your account. Learn more here.\n\u00a0\n4.3\nWhen you are logged into your Twitter account, you can manage your privacy settings and other account features here at any time.\n\u00a0\n4.4\nTwitter provides you a means to download the information you have shared through our services by following the steps here.

We may combine that data with information that we have collected. For example, some advertisers or advertising platforms may allow us to determine what other online services you might use so that we may place relevant ads on those services.\n            \nWe may use your data for the following purposes:\n---Identification and authentication: We use your data to verify you when you access your account.\n---Operating our services: We use your data to provide our services, process and fulfill orders, provide customer support, and to otherwise comply with our contractual obligations to you. We (and/or our third-party vendors) use your financial information to process purchases made by you and to pay you amounts you have earned.\n---Communicating with you: We use your data when we communicate with you (e.g., when we respond to a customer support or other inquiry).\n---Improving our services: We use your data to understand how our services are being used and how we can improve them. In general, we analyze aggregated data, rather than specific user data. We may, however, need to analyze a specific case to address a specific problem (e.g., a bug that affects only a few accounts).\n---Customizing your experience: We use your data to personalize the service to you. This may include remembering your preferences for language or volume or displaying videos that you might enjoy, based upon your viewing choices.\n---Marketing and advertising: We use your data to display ads and send you offers. We may also use your data in delivering third-party advertisements to you. This may include \"targeted ads\" based upon your activities.\n---Exercising our rights: Where reasonably necessary, we use your data to exercise our legal rights and prevent abuse of our service. For example, we may use your data to detect and prevent fraud, spam, or content that violates our Terms of Service.\n---Legal compliance: We use your data where we are legally required to do so. For example, we may need to gather your data to respond to a subpoena or court order.\n---Protecting your information: Where appropriate, we may anonymize, backup, and delete certain data.\nWe may use algorithms and other automated means to implement any of the above.\nWe share data with third parties as follows:\n---As you instruct: We may make your profile and videos available to others as you instruct in using our services.

You may revoke these consents.\n---Authorized vendors: We may share your data with third-party vendors that help us operate our services, process orders, and comply with your instructions and our contractual obligations. This includes payment processors, content delivery networks (CDNs), cloud-based hosting services, monitoring services, email service providers, quality assurance and testing vendors, fraud and abuse prevention vendors, customer relations management (CRM) vendors, and shipment vendors.\n---Advertising: We may share your data with advertising companies to display relevant ads to you. Unless you expressly agree, we will not share or sell your name, email address, or physical address with such persons.\n---Analytics: We may share your data with persons who provide analytics showing how customers are using our services. \n---Affiliates and advisors: We may share your data with our parent company, IAC/InterActiveCorp, and our auditors and advisors for planning, financial reporting, accounting, auditing, tax filings, and legal compliance. Unless you expressly agree, we will not share your data with our parent or any affiliate for other purposes, such as direct marketing.\n---Certain legal situations: We may share your data where we believe disclosure is necessary to comply with a legal obligation or in connection with a corporate transaction as discussed in Section 6.\n---Aggregated or anonymized information: We may publicly disclose non-personal aggregated or anonymized information such as our number of visitors and registered users.\n                We use reasonable efforts to vet vendors for their privacy and data security practices. We require that such vendors agree to protect the data we share.\n            \nWe may disclose your data in response to official requests (e.g., court orders, subpoenas, search warrants, national security requests, etc.) (\"requests\") that we receive from government authorities or parties to legal proceedings. We direct law enforcement agencies to our Law Enforcement Guidelines page.\nWe handle U.S. requests in accordance with U.S. law. If the request originates from a foreign jurisdiction, we will typically disclose information where we in good faith believe that disclosure is permitted by both U.S. law and local law. In all cases, we may raise or waive any legal objection or right available to us, in our sole discretion.\nWe may disclose user data where we reasonably believe that someone's life is at risk. For example, if we become aware of a person threatening to commit suicide, we may share that person's data with appropriate entities that may have the ability to help.\nWe may disclose user data to report suspected crimes. We report content suspected of exploiting minors to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children (NCMEC) along with the data identifying the uploading user.\nWe may disclose user data in situations involving legal claims against us or one of our users. If you submit a Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) or other takedown notice, we may share that notice with the affected user. If you challenge such a notice, we may share your response with the complainant. \nWe may share your data with potential transaction partners, advisors, and others in the event our company is, in whole or part, acquired by a third party. In such case, we will use reasonable efforts to require the acquiring entity to comply with this Privacy Policy.\nWe retain your data for as long as you have an account. When you close an account, we will delete its content, including its videos. We may retain logs of automatically collected information (for internal analytics); your email address; your tax information; communications with you; and your transactional information (for auditing, tax, and financial purposes). When we no longer have a business reason for retaining data, we will delete or anonymize it.\nWe retain deleted videos on our servers for a short period in case you wish to reverse deletion. Once we delete a video, we may not be able to recover it. If you have previously made a video public, the video or its thumbnail may be discoverable in a search engine's cache for a time. We have no control over search engines; however, we will, upon request, send a request for deletion to major search engines.\nIf we receive legal process pertaining to your account, we will retain your data for as long as we in good faith believe is necessary to comply with the legal process. Similarly, if we believe that your account has been involved in wrongdoing, we may preserve your data to defend or assert our rights.\nWe enable you to make numerous choices about your data:\n---You may choose not to provide us with certain information. For example, you may choose not to create an account or not to provide optional account information. \n---You may change your account and video privacy settings. See Section 9 for more details.\n---You may change or correct information voluntarily submitted to us. We encourage you to keep your data current by viewing your settings page. \n---You may opt out of receiving commercial emails from us. See Section 10 for more details. \n---You may limit the use of cookies. See our Cookie Policy for options. \n---You may backup your videos.\n---You may close your account (which will delete all videos) or delete certain videos. \nUsers from certain countries may have additional rights. See Section 14 for more details.\nOur video hosting and sharing tools offer the ability to limit the distribution of your content, including your videos. This section explains some of your choices.\nProfile\nSome of our online subscription plans enable you to \"hide\" your profile or otherwise make it inaccessible on our website. Your profile will, however, remain accessible to persons who have access to your account or content.\nTeam Members\nSome of our subscription plans enable you to grant account-level access rights to others. Persons with such access (\"Team Members\") may be able to see and potentially alter your data. You may revoke or downgrade Team Member access at any time.\nVideos\nWe enable you to manage the privacy settings of your videos. Your options, which depend on your subscription plan, may include:\n---Public (or \"anyone\"): Your video will be publicly-available.\n---Just you (i.e., \"only me\"): Your video will be available to you and authorized Team Members.\n---Selected people: Your video will be available to users you select (such as users you follow or specifically-designated users).\n---Password-protected: Your video may be accessed by anyone who enters the password you have set.\n---Private link: Your video may be accessed by anyone who enters the link assigned to it.\nYou may change these settings at any time. Changes will be applied on a go-forward basis. You should exercise caution in granting access to others. Once you have granted access to someone else, you lose a degree of control over the distribution of your video as those persons may share the password and/or link with other people. Regardless of your profile or video privacy settings, Vimeo reserves the right to inspect them for compliance with its Terms of Service, to provide customer support, or to address technical issues.\nEmails\nBy creating an account, you consent to receive commercial emails from us. This includes newsletters and offers. Users from certain countries may have the ability to opt out or opt in at the time of account creation. All users may decline to receive commercial messages in their account settings. Please note that any opt-out request may take several days to process and you will continue to receive transactional emails from us (e.g., emails confirming transactions and/or providing information about your account).\nMobile Device Communications\nWe may, with your consent, send push notifications in our apps. You may disable these by declining them or changing the app's settings. To the extent provided, we may, with your consent, send SMS messages to your mobile telephone for authentication and security purposes. You may opt out of receiving such messages at any time.\nWe use physical, technical, and organizational security measures to safeguard your data from unauthorized or accidental disclosure. Despite these efforts, no information system can be 100% secure, so we cannot guarantee the absolute security of your information.\nUsers also have a role to play in keeping their data safe. We encourage you to use a unique and hard-to-guess password for your account and to not share it with others. You should only grant access rights to people who you know and trust, and, even then, you should be careful in granting all access rights. You should monitor your account regularly. If you believe that someone has gained access to your account without your permission, please contact us immediately so that we can investigate.\nYou may receive other people's data in using our service. If you receive information from other users, you must comply with all laws, including those concerning privacy, data security, and online marketing.\nWe may provide links to online services that we do not own or operate. These services fall outside of this Privacy Policy and we have no control over the data they collect. For example, if you click on an advertisement, you may be taken to the advertiser's website. Once on a third-party site, your data may be collected by others. We encourage you to read the privacy policies of such services before using them. \nYou may use our service through third-party sites. For example, you may watch a video that is embedded on a third-party site or use one of our apps on a third-party platform. This Privacy Policy covers our apps and video players, but does not cover any third-party site or any third-party video player.  \n14.1 Location of Data\nVimeo is based in the United States. We provide services globally using computer systems, servers, and databases located in the U.S. and other countries. When you use our services from outside of the U.S., your information will be transferred to, stored in, and processed in the U.S. and other countries.

In accordance with the GDPR, we may transfer your personal information from your home country to the U.S. (or other countries) based upon the following legal frameworks:\n---Legitimate business interests:  We could not provide our services or comply with our obligations to you without transferring your personal information to the U.S.\n---Consent: We may transfer your personal information when we receive your express, revocable consent.\n---Our use of Standard Contractual Clauses (also known as \"Model Clauses\") where appropriate.\n---The EU-U.S. and Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield frameworks, as described further below.\nYou have the right to: opt out of non-essential cookies (see our Cookie Policy); access, correct, delete, restrict, or object to our use of your personal information; be forgotten; port your data; and withdraw consents. We enable exercise of these rights primarily through our services (which we reserve the right to modify). For example, we allow users to change their information, download their videos, and close their accounts. We also fulfil our obligations in response to direct requests. We will endeavor to process requests within one month. Please note that we may not be able to comply with requests to the extent that they would cause us to violate any law or infringe any other person's rights. We reserve the right to request appropriate identification. We will process requests free of charge unless they would impose an unreasonable cost on us.\nIf you have a request, complaint or inquiry, please contact our Data Protection Officer at the address listed in Section 15. We are committed to working with you to obtain a fair resolution of any issue. You also have the right to file a complaint with the supervisory data protection authority of your jurisdiction.\n14.3 Privacy Shield (EU and Swiss Users)\nThis Section 14.3 applies only to natural persons residing in the European Union and Switzerland (for the purpose of this section only, \"you\" or \"your\" shall be limited accordingly).  Vimeo complies with the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework and Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework (collectively, \"Privacy Shield\") regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal information transferred from the EU to the U.S.\nVimeo adheres to the Privacy Shield principles of notice, choice, onward transfer, security, data integrity, access, and enforcement (the \"Privacy Shield Principles\"). Vimeo has established policies and procedures to ensure compliance with the Privacy Shield Principles and will conduct an annual internal assessment to ensure such compliance. If there is any conflict between the terms of this Privacy Policy and the Privacy Shield Principles, the Privacy Shield Principles shall govern.\nVimeo has certified to the U.S. Department of Commerce that it adheres to the Privacy Shield Principles. To learn more about the Privacy Shield program, and to view Vimeo's certification, please visit https://www.privacyshield.gov. By making this certification, Vimeo is subject to the investigatory and enforcement powers of the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC).\nWhere Vimeo has transferred personal information of EU or Swiss residents to third parties, Vimeo shall be liable if those third parties do not process personal information in compliance with the Privacy Shield Principles. This shall not be the case where Vimeo establishes that it is not responsible for the damage caused by the third party.\nIn accordance with Privacy Shield Principles, Vimeo commits to resolve complaints about our collection or use of your personal information. If you have inquiries or complaints regarding our Privacy Shield policy, you should first contact Vimeo at the address listed in Section 15. If you do not receive timely acknowledgment of your complaint from us, or if we have not addressed your complaint to your satisfaction, please contact our independent recourse mechanism provider, JAMS, at https://www.jamsadr.com/eu-us-privacy-shield, to file a complaint. JAMS' services are provided at no cost to you.\nIf you have an unresolved complaint after contacting both Vimeo and JAMS, you may elect to arbitrate your Privacy Shield claims against Vimeo pursuant to Annex I of the Privacy Shield Principles, which provides for binding arbitration administered by the American Arbitration Association. Such arbitration will be binding upon you and Vimeo.\n14.4 California User Rights\nCalifornia residents have the right to opt out of disclosing information to third parties for the purpose of allowing such third parties to directly market their products and services.

Vimeo\u2019s rights and remedies are cumulative. No failure or delay by Vimeo in exercising any right will waive any further exercise of that right.

The NAI\u2019s opt-out tool can be found here, and the DAA\u2019s opt out tool can be found here.\nTo opt out of tracking and receiving targeted ads in our mobile apps based on your behavior, you can use the instructions below, which apply to iOS and Android devices:\nFor iOS 7 and higher: Go to your Settings > Select Privacy > Select Advertising > Enable the \u201cLimit Ad Tracking\u201d setting.\nFor most Android devices with OS 2.2 or higher and Google Play Services version 4.0 or higher: Open your Google Settings app > Ads > Enable \u201cOpt out of interest-based advertising\u201d. Some Android phones may have Google Settings in other settings locations.\nNote that opting-out may not stop information from being collected on the web and will not stop your receiving advertising. However, if you opt-out, the applicable advertiser will not use any information collected from our applicable Website or mobile app for the purpose of displaying personalized ads.\nWe also collect anonymized details about visitors to our website for the purposes of aggregate statistics or reporting purposes. However, no single individual will be identifiable from the anonymized details we collect for these purposes.\nWhile we take appropriate technical and organizational measures to safeguard the personal information that you provide to us, no transmission over the Internet can ever be guaranteed secure. Consequently, please note that we cannot guarantee the security of any personal information that you transfer over the Internet to us.\nWhere we have given you, or where you have chosen, a password that enable you to access certain parts of our Website, you are responsible for keeping this confidential. Such passwords should not be shared with anyone.\nSubject to the rights of users located in the EEA as described below, we will retain information (including personal information) for as long as we need to use it for the reasons set out in this privacy policy and will delete it after that time except where we need to keep any personal information to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, or enforce our agreements.\nIn some circumstances, we may anonymize your personal data (so that it can no longer be associated with you) for research or statistical purposes in which case we may use this information indefinitely without further notice to you.\nOur Website and/or Apps contain links to other websites operated by third parties. Please note that this privacy policy applies only to the personal information that we collect through our Website and we cannot be responsible for personal information that third parties may collect, store and use through their websites. You should always read the privacy policy of each website you visit carefully.\nWhat is our justification for handling your personal data?\nUnder European data protection laws, we have to ensure that we process your personal information fairly and lawfully. This means that we must have a \u201clegal basis\u201d for each of our processing activities where they relate to the personal data of an individual within the EEA. These bases include:\n---Consent \u2013 we may decide to obtain your specific, freely given consent to one or more processing activities;\n---Legal obligation \u2013 we may need to process your data where it is necessary to comply with applicable laws that we are subject to;\n---Performance of a contract \u2013 we may process your data if we are entering into a contract with you, or taking preparatory steps to do so;\n---Legitimate interests \u2013 we may process your personal data where we believe that we have a legitimate interest in doing so, and we have analyzed this and determined that our interests are not overridden by the impact on your rights and freedoms under data protection law.\nWe rely on these legal bases in different ways, and in relation to different types of processing of your personal data.\nConsent\nWe process your personal information collected through the use of Marketing Cookies (as described in the Cookie section above) on the basis of your consent, which we ask for when you first visit our Website. You are entitled to withdraw your consent to our use of these Cookies. The list of partners for which we request consent is located at our Vendor List. In order to withdraw your consent, please visit the \u201cReset Your Tracking Preferences\u201d button at the bottom of this Privacy Policy.\nLegitimate Interests\nWe believe that our use of your other personal information described herein is necessary for our legitimate interests, which are as follows:\n---To run, grow and develop our business;\n---To operate our Website;\n---For marketing, market research and business development; and\n---For internal administrative purposes.\nIf we rely on our, or another person\u2019s, legitimate interests for using your personal information, we will undertake a balancing test to ensure that our (or the other person\u2019s) legitimate interests are not outweighed by your interests or fundamental rights and freedoms which require protection. You can ask us for information on this balancing test by using the contact details in the \u201cComplaints, Questions and Comments\u201d section below.\nWe process your personal information collected through the use of Non-Marketing Cookies (as described in the Cookie section above) on the basis of our legitimate interests. We also rely on legitimate interests to use your personal information in order to provide you with access to our Website, and to make sure that it works properly, and to keep a record of who is accessing and making changes to the different parts of our Website.\nResidents in the EEA have the following rights:\n---The right to ask us to provide you with copies of personal information that we hold about you at any time free of charge, although we may charge a reasonable fee if your request is manifestly unfounded or excessive, or repetitive. Please utilize the form found here when making this request: Download Your Data.\n---The right to ask us to update or correct any out-of-date or incorrect personal information that we hold about you (in accordance with applicable data protection laws).\n---The rights to request that we stop using or delete your personal information (in certain circumstances we may not be able to stop using your personal information but if that is the case, we will let you know why). Please utilize the form found here when making this request: Right to Be Forgotten.\n---The right to opt out of any marketing communications that we (or any third party to whom we have disclosed your personal information with your consent) may send you.\nIf you wish to exercise any of the above rights, please use the forms indicated where applicable and email us at support@fandom.com.\nWe will consider all such requests and provide our response within a reasonable period (and in any event within any time period required by law). Please note, however, that certain personal information may be exempt from such requests in certain circumstances.\nIf an exception applies, we will tell you this when responding to your request. We may request you provide us with information necessary to confirm your identity before responding to any request you make.\nPlease also note for security and fraud investigation and prevention purposes, we will retain the full IP address for users located in the EEA for up to 12 months.\nIn addition, we keep a copy of requests submitted to us to comply with our own legal obligation to maintain data processing records. Please also note that certain information, such as your IP address (if you edit while not logged in) and any public contributions to the FANDOM community sites is archived and displayed indefinitely by design; the transparency of each community\u2019s contribution and revision histories is critical to their efficacy and trustworthiness. In addition, the anonymization process cannot ensure complete or comprehensive anonymization of all of the content or information posted on our Website related to your prior username. If your request is granted, the name change will only occur in automatically generated logs (such as page histories) in association with content that you posted. The name change will not delete mentions of your prior username by third parties.\nWhere personal information is held by us, it is held in the U.S.A.\nWe will also transfer the personal information that we collect about you to third party processors located in countries that are outside the EEA, or to members of our group of companies in connection with the above purposes. If we provide any of your personal information to any such non-EEA suppliers, we will take appropriate measures to ensure that the recipient protects your personal information adequately.\nWe have a Data Protection Officer to assist with all queries regarding our processing of personal information.\nWade Warren, DPO\nc/o Wikia, Inc.\n149 New Montgomery Street, 3rd Floor\nSan Francisco, CA 94105\nEmail: DPO@fandom.com\nPhone: (415) 980-5647\nIf you have any complaints about our Website, please contact us at:\nAddress: 149 New Montgomery Street, 3rd Floor, San Francisco, CA 94105\nEmail: support@fandom.com\nTelephone: (415) 762-0780\nIn the EEA you may also make a complaint to our supervisory body for data protection matters (for example, the Information Commissioner\u2019s Office in the UK) or seek a remedy through local courts if you believe your rights have been breached.\nReset your tracking preferences on fandom.com\n"}, "wikihow.com": {"http://www.wikihow.com/wikiHow:Terms-of-Use": "\nwikiHow:Terms of Use - wikiHow\n   \n---\nMESSAGES\n---\nLOG IN\nLog in\nFacebookLoading...\nGoogleLoading...\nCivicLoading...\nwikiHow Account\n\t\tNo account yet?\t\tCreate an account\n \n---\nEXPLORE\nCommunity DashboardRandom ArticleAbout UsCategoriesRecent Changes \n---\nHELP US\nWrite an ArticleRequest a New ArticleAnswer a RequestMore Ideas... \n \n---Article---Edit---Discuss\nAt wikiHow, our mission is to empower every person on the planet to learn how to do anything.

Governing Law.\nYou agree that: (i) the Service shall be deemed solely based in California; and (ii) the Service shall be deemed a passive one that does not give rise to personal jurisdiction over wikiHow, either specific or general, in jurisdictions other than California. This Agreement shall be governed by the internal substantive laws of the State of California, without respect to its conflict of laws principles. The application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. You agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of the federal and state courts located in Santa Clara County, California for any actions for which we retain the right to seek injunctive or other equitable relief in a court of competent jurisdiction to prevent the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation or violation of a our copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, patents, or other intellectual property or proprietary rights, as set forth in the Arbitration provision below.\nB. Arbitration.\nFor any dispute with wikiHow, you agree to first contact us at wiki@wikiHow.com and attempt to resolve the dispute with us informally. In the unlikely event that wikiHow has not been able to resolve a dispute it has with you after attempting to do so informally, we each agree to resolve any claim, dispute, or controversy (excluding any wikiHow claims for injunctive or other equitable relief) arising out of or in connection with or relating to this Agreement, or the breach or alleged breach thereof (collectively, \u201cClaims\u201d), by binding arbitration by the American Arbitration Association (\u201cAAA\u201d) under the Commercial Arbitration Rules and Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes then in effect for the AAA, except as provided herein. The arbitration will be conducted in Santa Clara County, California, unless you and wikiHow agree otherwise. Each party will be responsible for paying any AAA filing, administrative and arbitrator fees in accordance with AAA rules. The award rendered by the arbitrator shall include costs of arbitration, reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees and reasonable costs for expert and other witnesses, and any judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction. Nothing in this Section shall prevent either party from seeking injunctive or other equitable relief from the courts as necessary to prevent the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation, or violation of that party\u2019s data security, Intellectual Property Rights, or other proprietary rights. ALL CLAIMS MUST BE BROUGHT IN THE PARTIES\u2019 INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING, AND, UNLESS WE AGREE OTHERWISE, THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE MORE THAN ONE PERSON\u2019S CLAIMS. YOU AGREE THAT, BY ENTERING INTO THIS AGREEMENT, YOU AND WIKIHOW ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION.\nA. Assignment.\nThis Agreement, and any rights and licenses granted hereunder, may not be transferred or assigned by you, but may be assigned by wikiHow without restriction. Any attempted transfer or assignment in violation hereof shall be null and void.\nB. Notification Procedures and Changes to the Agreement.\nwikiHow may provide notifications, whether such notifications are required by law or are for marketing or other business related purposes, to you via email notice, written or hard copy notice, or through posting of such notice on our website, as determined by wikiHow in our sole discretion. wikiHow reserves the right to determine the form and means of providing notifications to our Users, provided that you may opt out of certain means of notification as described in this Agreement. wikiHow is not responsible for any automatic filtering you or your network provider may apply to email notifications we send to the email address you provide us. wikiHow may, in its sole discretion, modify or update this Agreement from time to time, and so you should review this page periodically.

Your continued use of the Service after any such change constitutes your acceptance of the new Terms of Use. If you do not agree to any of these terms or any future Terms of Use, do not use or access (or continue to access) the Service.\nC. Entire Agreement/Severability.\nThis Agreement, together with any amendments and any additional agreements you may enter into with wikiHow in connection with the Service, shall constitute the entire agreement between you and wikiHow concerning the Service. If any provision of this Agreement is deemed invalid by a court of competent jurisdiction, the invalidity of such provision shall not affect the validity of the remaining provisions of this Agreement, which shall remain in full force and effect.\nD. No Waiver.\nNo waiver of any term of this Agreement shall be deemed a further or continuing waiver of such term or any other term, and wikiHow\u2019s failure to assert any right or provision under this Agreement shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision.\nE.

We cannot work collectively without gathering, sharing, and analyzing information about our users as we seek new ways to make the Wikimedia Sites more usable, safer, and more beneficial. \nWe believe that information-gathering and use should go hand-in-hand with transparency. This Privacy Policy explains how the Wikimedia Foundation, the non-profit organization that hosts the Wikimedia Sites, like Wikipedia, collects, uses, and shares information we receive from you through your use of the Wikimedia Sites. It is essential to understand that, by using any of the Wikimedia Sites, you consent to the collection, transfer, processing, storage, disclosure, and use of your information as described in this Privacy Policy. That means that reading this Policy carefully is important. \nWe believe that you shouldn't have to provide nonpublic personal information to participate in the free knowledge movement. You do not have to provide things like your real name, address, or date of birth to sign up for a standard account or contribute content to the Wikimedia Sites.\nWe do not sell or rent your Personal Information, nor do we give it to others to sell you anything. We use it to figure out how to make the Wikimedia Sites more engaging and accessible, to see which ideas work, and to make learning and contributing more fun. Put simply: we use this information to make the Wikimedia Sites better for you.\nAfter all, it's people like you, the champions of free knowledge, who make it possible for the Wikimedia Sites to not only exist, but also grow and thrive.\nDefinitions\nBack to top \nWe recognize that only a minority of you are familiar with technical terms like \u201ctracking pixels\u201d and \u201ccookies\u201d used in the Privacy Policy. Whether you are brand new to privacy terminology or you are an expert who just wants a refresher, you might find our Glossary of Key Terms helpful.\nBecause everyone (not just lawyers) should be able to easily understand how and why their information is collected and used, we use common language instead of more formal terms throughout this Policy. To help ensure your understanding of some particular key terms, here is a table of translations:\nWhen we say...\n... we mean:\n\"the Wikimedia Foundation\" / \"the Foundation\" / \"we\" / \"us\" / \"our\"\nThe Wikimedia Foundation, Inc., the non-profit organization that operates the Wikimedia Sites.\n\"Wikimedia Sites\" / \"our services\"\nWikimedia websites and services (regardless of language), including our main projects, such as Wikipedia and Wikimedia Commons, as well as mobile applications, APIs, emails, and notifications; excluding, however, sites and services listed in the \"What This Privacy Policy Doesn't Cover\" section below.\n\"you\" / \"your\" / \"me\"\nYou, regardless of whether you are an individual, group, or organization, and regardless of whether you are using the Wikimedia Sites or our services on behalf of yourself or someone else.\n\"this Policy\" / \"this Privacy Policy\"\nThis document, entitled the \"Wikimedia Foundation Privacy Policy\".\n\"contributions\"\nContent you add or changes you make to any Wikimedia Sites.\n\"personal information\"\nInformation you provide us or information we collect from you that could be used to personally identify you. To be clear, while we do not necessarily collect all of the following types of information, we consider at least the following to be \u201cpersonal information\u201d if it is otherwise nonpublic and can be used to identify you:\n(a) your real name, address, phone number, email address, password, identification number on government-issued ID, IP address, user-agent information, credit card number;\n(b) when associated with one of the items in subsection (a), any sensitive data such as date of birth, gender, sexual orientation, racial or ethnic origins, marital or familial status, medical conditions or disabilities, political affiliation, and religion; and\n(c) any of the items in subsections (a) or (b) when associated with your user account.\n\"third party\" / \"third parties\"\nIndividuals, entities, websites, services, products, and applications that are not controlled, managed, or operated by the Wikimedia Foundation. This includes other Wikimedia users and independent organizations or groups who help promote the Wikimedia movement such as Wikimedia chapters, thematic organizations, and user groups as well as volunteers, employees, directors, officers, grant recipients, and contractors of those organizations or groups.\nWhat This Privacy Policy Does & Doesn't Cover\nExcept as explained below, this Privacy Policy applies to our collection and handling of information about you that we receive as a result of your use of any of the Wikimedia Sites. This Policy also applies to information that we receive from our partners or other third parties. To understand more about what this Privacy Policy covers, please see below.\nExamples of What This Privacy Policy Covers\nFor the sake of clarity, this Privacy Policy covers, regardless of language:\n---All of our major sites (found at list of major projects), such as Wikipedia, including user pages, discussion pages, and noticeboards.\n---Our blogs and APIs (unless we have provided a separate policy for those services).\n---Official Wikimedia Foundation mobile applications.\n---Emails, SMS, and notifications from us or sent to us from you.\nThis Privacy Policy, however, does not cover some situations where we may gather or process information. For example, some uses may be covered by separate privacy policies (like those of the Wikimedia Shop) or sites or services run by third parties (such as third-party developer projects on Wikimedia Cloud Services). To understand more about what this Privacy Policy does not cover, please see below.\nMore on what this Privacy Policy doesn\u2019t cover\nThis section is part of the Privacy Policy and is meant to explain in detail which situations are not covered by our Privacy Policy.\nWikimedia Sites and Tools with alternative policies\nSome Wikimedia Foundation websites or tools have alternative privacy policies or provisions that differ from this Privacy Policy. These websites include:\n---Wikimedia Shop (covered by the shop's policy);\n---donate.wikimedia.org, including the donation process, such as clicking on a donation banner (covered by the Donor Privacy Policy); and\n---the Wikipedia Reading Lists Browser Extension, which is governed by a separate Privacy Policy. This separate policy will also be made available where the Extension can be downloaded.\nIf a Wikimedia Foundation website is governed by an alternative privacy policy, it will link to such policy. When a Wikimedia Foundation tool is governed by an alternative privacy policy, the page where the tool may be downloaded or enabled will include a link to that policy.\nCommunity members\nThe Wikimedia Sites are collaborative labors of love that are constantly maintained and updated by a global community of volunteers. As a result, some volunteers have access to certain Personal Information, and use of that Personal Information may not be governed by this Privacy Policy. Volunteers that have such access include:\n---Administrative volunteers, such as CheckUsers or Stewards. These are volunteers who enforce Wikimedia Site policies and ensure the safety of the Wikimedia Sites. When these administrators access Personal Information that is nonpublic, they are required to comply with our Access to Nonpublic Information Policy, as well as other, tool-specific policies.\n---Tool providers. Tool providers. We support platforms for third-party developers to experiment and develop new tools and sites, such as wmflabs.org.  When you use one of the tools developed by these volunteers, you may transfer information to them. When these volunteers access nonpublic information or Personal Information, they are required to comply with the terms governing the particular platform the tool is available on.\n---Other users. We provide several tools that allow users to communicate with each other. The communications may be covered by this Policy while they pass through our systems, but the users who receive these communications, and what they do with the communications once they receive them, are not covered by this Policy. Examples include:\nposting to Foundation-hosted email lists;\nrequesting support from volunteers through our online ticketing system (email sent to info[at]wikimedia.org goes to this system);\nemailing other users through the Wikimedia Sites (for example, by using the \"Email this user\" feature); and\nchatting on IRC (such as on the #wikipedia channel).\nThird parties\nThis Privacy Policy only covers the way the Wikimedia Foundation collects, uses and discloses Personal Information and does not address the practices of third parties. For example, this Privacy Policy does not address the practices of:\n---Websites run by other organizations, like websites linked to from the \u201cReferences\u201d sections of Wikipedia, or run by Wikimedia chapters or other movement organizations. These organizations may receive information from you if you visit their websites after using one of the Wikimedia Sites. They are governed by their own privacy policies.\n---Mobile applications provided by other organizations or individuals. These organizations or individuals may receive information from you if you use those applications to access the Wikimedia Sites or Wikimedia Site content. They are governed by their own privacy policies.\nSometimes, volunteers may place a data-collecting tool, such as a script, gadget, tracking pixel, or share button, on a Wikimedia Site without our knowledge. This Policy does not cover how third parties handle the information they receive as a result of such a tool. If you come across such a third-party tool, and you believe it violates this Policy, you can remove the tool yourself, or report it to privacy[at]wikimedia.org so we can investigate.\nWhere community policies govern information, such as the CheckUser policy, the relevant community may add to the rules and obligations set out in this Policy. However, they are not permitted to create new exceptions or otherwise reduce the protections offered by this Policy.\nYour Public Contributions\nWhatever you post on Wikimedia Sites can be seen and used by everyone.\nWhen you make a contribution to any Wikimedia Site, including on user or discussion pages, you are creating a permanent, public record of every piece of content added, removed, or altered by you. The page history will show when your contribution or deletion was made, as well as your username (if you are signed in) or your IP address (if you are not signed in). We may use your public contributions, either aggregated with the public contributions of others or individually, to create new features or data-related products for you or to learn more about how the Wikimedia Sites are used.\nPublicly Visible Information\nUnless this Policy says otherwise, you should assume that information that you actively contribute to the Wikimedia Sites, including Personal Information, is publicly visible and can be found by search engines. Like most things on the Internet, anything you share may be copied and redistributed throughout the Internet by other people. Please do not contribute any information that you are uncomfortable making permanently public, like revealing your real name or location in your contributions.\nYou should be aware that specific data made public by you or aggregated data that is made public by us can be used by anyone for analysis and to infer further information, such as which country a user is from, political affiliation and gender.\nBack to top \nAccount Information & Registration\nYou do not need to create an account to use any Wikimedia Site.\nIf you do create an account, you do not need to give us your name or email address.\nIf you do not create an account, your contributions will be publicly attributed to your IP address.\nWant to create an account? Great! Don't want to create an account? No problem!\nYou are not required to create an account to read or contribute to a Wikimedia Site, except under rare circumstances. However, if you contribute without signing in, your contribution will be publicly attributed to the IP address associated with your device.\nIf you want to create a standard account, in most cases we require only a username and a password.\nMore on Usernames\nYour username will be publicly visible, so please be careful about using your real name as your username. Your password is only used to verify that the account is yours. Your IP address is also automatically submitted to us, and we record it temporarily to help prevent abuse. No other personal information is required: no name, no email address, no date of birth, no credit card information.\nOnce created, user accounts cannot be removed entirely (although you can usually hide the information on your user page if you choose to). This is because your public contributions must be associated with their author (you!). In some circumstances, the Wikimedia communities can assist users with removing additional information related to their account from the projects.\nTo gain a better understanding of the demographics of our users, to localize our services and to learn how we can improve our services, we may ask you for more demographic information, such as gender or age, about yourself. We will tell you if such information is intended to be public or private, so that you can make an informed decision about whether you want to provide us with that information. Providing such information is always completely optional. If you don't want to, you don't have to\u2014it's as simple as that.\nBack to top \nLocation Information\nGPS & Other Location Technologies\nSome features we offer work better if we know what area you are in.\nIf you consent, we can use GPS (and other technologies commonly used to determine location) to show you more relevant content. We keep information obtained by these technologies confidential, except as provided in this Policy. You can learn more by checking out the list of examples of how we use these technologies in our FAQ.\nBack to top \nMetadata\nSometimes, we automatically receive location data from your device. For example, if you want to upload a photo on the Wikimedia Commons mobile app, we may receive metadata, such as the place and time you took the photo, automatically from your device. Please be aware that, unlike location information collected using GPS signals described above, the default setting on your mobile device typically includes the metadata in your photo or video upload to the Wikimedia Sites. If you do not want metadata sent to us and made public at the time of your upload, please change your settings on your device.\nBack to top \nIP Addresses\nFinally, when you visit any Wikimedia Site, we automatically receive the IP address of the device (or your proxy server) you are using to access the Internet, which could be used to infer your geographical location.\nBack to top \nWe use certain technologies to collect information about how you use Wikimedia Sites.\nLike other websites, we receive some information about you automatically when you visit the Wikimedia Sites.\nWe also use a variety of commonly-used technologies, like cookies, to collect information regarding how you use the Wikimedia Sites, make our services safer and easier to use, and to help create a better and more customizable experience for you.\nWe want to make the Wikimedia Sites better for you by learning more about how you use them. Examples of this might include how often you visit the Wikimedia Sites, what you like, what you find helpful, how you get to the Wikimedia Sites, and whether you would use a helpful feature more if we explained it differently. We also want this Policy and our practices to reflect our community's values. For this reason, we keep information related to your use of the Wikimedia Sites confidential, except as provided in this Policy.\nBack to top \nInformation We Receive Automatically\nBecause of how browsers work, we receive some information automatically when you visit the Wikimedia Sites. This information includes the type of device you are using (possibly including unique device identification numbers, for some beta versions of our mobile applications), the type and version of your browser, your browser's language preference, the type and version of your device's operating system, in some cases the name of your internet service provider or mobile carrier, the website that referred you to the Wikimedia Sites, which pages you request and visit, and the date and time of each request you make to the Wikimedia Sites.\nPut simply, we use this information to enhance your experience with Wikimedia Sites. For example, we use this information to administer the sites, provide greater security, and fight vandalism; optimize mobile applications, customize content and set language preferences, test features to see what works, and improve performance; understand how users interact with the Wikimedia Sites, track and study use of various features, gain understanding about the demographics of the different Wikimedia Sites, and analyze trends.\nBack to top \nInformation We Collect\nWe use a variety of commonly-used technologies, like cookies, to understand how you use the Wikimedia Sites, make our services safer and easier to use, and to help create a better and more customizable experience for you.\nWe actively collect some types of information with a variety of commonly-used technologies. These generally include tracking pixels, JavaScript, and a variety of \"locally stored data\" technologies, such as cookies and local storage. We realize that some of these technologies do not have the best reputation in town and can be used for less-than-noble purposes. So we want to be as clear as we can about why we use these methods and the type of information we collect with them.\nDepending on which technology we use, locally stored data can be anything from text, pictures, and whole articles (as we explain further below) to Personal Information (like your IP address) and information about your use of the Wikimedia Sites (like your username or the time of your visit).\nWe use this information to make your experience with the Wikimedia Sites safer and better, to gain a greater understanding of user preferences and their interaction with the Wikimedia Sites, and to generally improve our services. We will never use third-party cookies, unless we get your permission to do so. If you ever come across a third-party data collection tool that has not been authorized by you (such as one that may have been mistakenly placed by another user or administrator), please report it to us at privacy@wikimedia.org. \nMore on Locally Stored Data\nLocally stored data, JavaScript, and tracking pixels help us do things like:\n---Provide you with a customizable experience, such as using cookies to know your language preference, to remember the user preferences you set so we can provide you with the customized look and feel that you want, and to tell you about interesting Wikimedia issues and events in your area.\n---Deliver more relevant content to you faster. For example, we use local storage to store your most recently read articles directly on your device, so they can be retrieved quickly. Also, we use cookies to learn about the topics searched so that we can optimize the search results we deliver to you.\n---Understand how you use the Wikimedia Sites, so that we know what works and what is useful. For example, we might use cookies to learn about the list of articles you are following on your watchlist so that we can recommend similar articles that you may be interested in.\n---Understand how you use the Wikimedia Sites across different devices, so that we can make our varied Wikimedia Sites more efficient and effective for you.\n---Make the Wikimedia Sites more convenient to use, such as by using cookies to maintain your session when you log in or to remember your username in the login field.\nWant to know even more? You can read more about some of the specific cookies we use, when they expire, and what we use them for in our FAQ.\nWe believe this data collection helps improve your user experience, but you may remove or disable some or all locally stored data through your browser settings, depending on your browser. You can learn more about some options you have in our FAQ. While locally stored data may not be necessary to use our sites, some features will not function properly if you disable locally stored data.\nWhile the examples above concerning information about you collected through the use of data collection tools are kept confidential in accordance with this Policy, please note that some information about the actions taken by your username is made publicly available through public logs alongside actions taken by other users. For example, a public log may include the date your account was created on a Wikimedia Site along with the dates that other accounts were created on a Wikimedia Site.\nBack to top \nWe and our service providers use your information for the legitimate purpose of pursuing our charitable mission, including:\nOperating the Wikimedia Sites, sharing your contributions and administering our Services.\n---To help you share your knowledge with the world and add new features to our Services.\n---To arrange access to your account and provide you with related service.\n---To send administrative information to you, such as changes to our policies.\n---To allow you to send messages to another person if you choose to do so. Direct communications between users (such as messages sent through the \"Email this user\" feature), to the extent such communications are nonpublic and stored in or in transit through Wikimedia Foundation systems, are kept confidential by us, except as provided in this Policy.\nWe engage in these activities to manage our relationship with you, because we have a legitimate interest and/or to comply with our legal obligations.\nProviding customized Services.\n---To provide to you custom content, notices and settings and to enhance your experience with the Wikimedia Sites.\nWe will customize the Services, in some instances, at your direction; in all instances, in keeping with our legitimate charitable purpose of pursuing our mission.\nSending emails with news updates, surveys and communications about items we believe may be of interest to you.\n---To let you know about things that are happening with the Wikimedia Foundation, the Wikimedia Sites or the Wikimedia movement.\n---To alert you when there has been a change to an article that you have decided to follow.\nWe will send these types of emails to you only with your consent. We do not sell, rent, or use your email address to advertise third-party products or services to you. You can manage what kinds of notifications you receive and how often you receive them by going to your Notifications Preferences. You can learn more about email and notifications and how to change your preferences in our FAQ.\nSending optional surveys and requesting feedback.\nWe will always tell you, at the time we give you an opportunity to share your thoughts, how we plan on using your answers and any personal information you provide.  \nYour responses to our surveys and feedback requests are always optional.  We will email these types of requests to you only with your consent.  You can manage what kinds of notifications you receive and how often you receive them by going to your Notifications Preferences. You can learn more about email and notifications and how to change your preferences in our FAQ.\nImproving the Wikimedia Sites and making your user experience safer and better.\n---To use your public contributions, either aggregated with the public contributions of others or individually, to create new features or data-related products for you or to learn more about how the Wikimedia Sites are used.\n---For research and analytics.\n---To fight spam, identity theft, malware and other kinds of abuse.\n---To optimize mobile and other applications.\n---To test features to see what works, understand how users interact with the Wikimedia Sites, track and study use of various features, gain understanding about the demographics of the different Wikimedia Sites and analyze trends.\nWe engage in these activities to further our legitimate charitable purpose and/or to comply with our legal obligations.\nBack to top \nLocation Information\nGPS & Other Location Technologies\nAs stated above, we can use commonly-used location technologies to show you more relevant content.  For example, our mobile apps can identify articles from the Wikimedia sites about points of interest near your location.  As a reminder, you can deactivate our access to these location technologies at any time, and still use the Wikimedia Sites.\nBack to top \nMetadata\nAs stated above, we may automatically receive location data from your device. For example, if you upload a photo using the Wikimedia Commons mobile app, please be aware that the default setting on your mobile device typically results in the metadata associated with your photo being included in the upload.  As a reminder, if you do not want metadata sent to us and made public at the time of your upload, please change your settings on your device.\nBack to top \nIP Addresses\nWhen you visit any Wikimedia Site, we automatically receive the IP address of the device (or your proxy server) you are using to access the Internet, which could be used to infer your geographical location. We keep IP addresses confidential, except as provided in this Policy. If you are visiting Wikimedia Sites with your mobile device, we may use your IP address to provide anonymized or aggregated information to service providers regarding the volume of usage in certain areas.\nWe use this location information to make your experience with the Wikimedia Sites safer and better, to gain a greater understanding of user preferences and their interaction with the Wikimedia Sites, and to generally improve our services. For example, we use this information to provide greater security, optimize mobile applications, and learn how to expand and better support Wikimedia communities. We also use Personal Information in the manner described in the sections of this Policy titled \"For Legal Reasons\" and \"To Protect You, Ourselves & Others.\"\nBack to top \nWith Your Permission\nWe may share your information when you give us specific permission to do so, for legal reasons, and in the other circumstances described below.\nWe share your information for a particular purpose, if you agree. You can find more information in the list of examples in our FAQ.\nBack to top \nFor Legal Reasons\nWe will disclose your information in response to an official legal process only if we believe it to be legally valid. We will notify you of such requests when possible.\nWe will access, use, preserve, and/or disclose your Personal Information if we reasonably believe it necessary to satisfy a valid and legally enforceable warrant, subpoena, court order, law or regulation, or other judicial or administrative order. However, if we believe that a particular request for disclosure of a user's information is legally invalid or an abuse of the legal system and the affected user does not intend to oppose the disclosure themselves, we will try our best to fight it. We are committed to notifying you via email at least ten (10) calendar days, when possible, before we disclose your Personal Information in response to a legal demand. However, we may only provide notice if we are not legally restrained from contacting you, there is no credible threat to life or limb that is created or increased by disclosing the request, and you have provided us with an email address.\nNothing in this Privacy Policy is intended to limit any legal objections or defenses you may have to a third party's request (whether it be civil, criminal, or governmental) to disclose your information. We recommend seeking the advice of legal counsel immediately if such a request is made involving you.\nFor more information, see our Subpoena FAQ.\nBack to top \nIf the Organization is Transferred (Really Unlikely!)\nIn the unlikely event that the ownership of the Foundation changes, we will provide you 30 days\u2019 notice before any personal information is transferred to the new owners or becomes subject to a different privacy policy.\nIn the extremely unlikely event that ownership of all or substantially all of the Foundation changes, or we go through a reorganization (such as a merger, consolidation, or acquisition), we will continue to keep your Personal Information confidential, except as provided in this Policy, and provide notice to you via the Wikimedia Sites and a notification on WikimediaAnnounce-L or similar mailing list at least thirty (30) calendar days before any Personal Information is transferred or becomes subject to a different privacy policy.\nBack to top \nTo Protect You, Ourselves & Others\nWe, or users with certain administrative rights, may disclose information that is reasonably necessary to:\n---enforce or investigate potential violations of the Wikimedia Foundation or community-based policies;\n---protect our organization, infrastructure, employees, contractors, or the public; or\n---prevent imminent or serious bodily harm or death to a person.\nWe, or particular users with certain administrative rights as described below, may need to share your Personal Information if it is reasonably believed to be necessary to enforce or investigate potential violations of our Terms of Use, this Privacy Policy, or any Wikimedia Foundation or user community-based policies. We may also need to access and share information to investigate and defend ourselves against legal threats or actions.\nWikimedia Sites are collaborative, with users writing most of the policies and selecting from amongst themselves people to hold certain administrative rights. These rights may include access to limited amounts of otherwise nonpublic information about recent contributions and activity by other users. They use this access to help protect against vandalism and abuse, fight harassment of other users, and generally try to minimize disruptive behavior on the Wikimedia Sites. These various user-selected administrative groups have their own privacy and confidentiality guidelines, but all such groups are supposed to agree to follow our Access to Nonpublic Information Policy. These user-selected administrative groups are accountable to other users through checks and balances: users are selected through a community-driven process and overseen by their peers through a logged history of their actions. However, the legal names of these users are not known to the Wikimedia Foundation.\nWe hope that this never comes up, but we may disclose your Personal Information if we believe that it's reasonably necessary to prevent imminent and serious bodily harm or death to a person, or to protect our organization, employees, contractors, users, or the public. We may also disclose your Personal Information if we reasonably believe it necessary to detect, prevent, or otherwise assess and address potential spam, malware, fraud, abuse, unlawful activity, and security or technical concerns. (Check out the list of examples in our FAQ for more information.)\nBack to top \nTo Our Service Providers\nWe may disclose personal information to our third party service providers or contractors to help run or improve the Wikimedia Sites and provide services in support of our mission.\nAs hard as we may try, we can't do it all. So sometimes we use third-party service providers or contractors who help run or improve the Wikimedia Sites for you and other users. We give access to your Personal Information to these providers or contractors as needed to perform their services for us or to use their tools and services. We put requirements, such as confidentiality agreements, in place to help ensure that these service providers treat your information consistently with, and no less protective of your privacy than, the principles of this Policy. (Check out the list of examples in our FAQ.)\nIf you are visiting Wikimedia Sites with your mobile device, we use your IP address to provide anonymized or aggregated information to service providers regarding the volume of usage in certain areas.\nBack to top \nTo Understand & Experiment\n---We give volunteer developers and researchers access to systems that contain your information to allow them to protect, develop, and contribute to the Wikimedia Sites.\n---We also share non-Personal Information or aggregated information with third parties interested in studying the Wikimedia Sites.\n---When we share information with third parties for these purposes, we put reasonable technical and contractual protections in place to protect your information consistent with this Policy.\nThe open-source software that powers the Wikimedia Sites depends on the contributions of volunteer software developers, who spend time writing and testing code to help it improve and evolve with our users' needs. To facilitate their work, we give some developers limited access to systems that contain your Personal Information, but only as reasonably necessary for them to develop and contribute to the Wikimedia Sites. \nSimilarly, we share non-Personal Information or aggregated information with researchers, scholars, academics, and other interested third parties who wish to study the Wikimedia Sites. Sharing this information helps them understand usage, viewing, and demographics statistics and patterns. They then can share their findings with us and our users so that we can all better understand and improve the Wikimedia Sites.\nWhen we give access to personal information to third-party developers or researchers, we put requirements, such as reasonable technical and contractual protections, in place to help ensure that these service providers treat your information consistently with the principles of this Policy and in accordance with our instructions. If these developers or researchers later publish their work or findings, we ask that they not disclose your personal information. Please note that, despite the obligations we impose on developers and researchers, we cannot guarantee that they will abide by our agreement, nor do we guarantee that we will regularly screen or audit their projects. (You can learn more about re-identification in our FAQ.)\nBack to top \nBecause You Made It Public\nInformation that you post is public and can been seen and used by everyone.\nAny information you post publicly on the Wikimedia Sites is just that \u2013 public. For example, if you put your mailing address on your talk page, that is public, and not protected by this Policy.

Please think carefully about your desired level of anonymity before you disclose Personal Information on your user page or elsewhere.\nBack to top \nWe use a variety of physical and technical measures, policies, and procedures to help protect your information from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure.\nWe strive to protect your information from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure. We use a variety of physical and technical measures, policies, and procedures (such as access control procedures, network firewalls, and physical security) designed to protect our systems and your Personal Information. Unfortunately, there's no such thing as completely secure data transmission or storage, so we can't guarantee that our security will not be breached (by technical measures or through violation of our policies and procedures).\nWe will never ask for your password by email (but may send you a temporary password via email if you have requested a password reset). If you ever receive an email that requests your password, please let us know by sending it to privacy@wikimedia.org, so we can investigate the source of the email.\nBack to top \nExcept as otherwise stated in this policy, we only keep your Personal Information as long as necessary to maintain, understand and improve the Wikimedia Sites or to comply with U.S. law.\nOnce we receive Personal Information from you, we keep it for the shortest possible time that is consistent with the maintenance, understanding, and improvement of the Wikimedia Sites, and our obligations under applicable U.S. law. Non-personal information may be retained indefinitely. (Check out the list of examples in our FAQ.)\nPlease remember that certain information, such as your IP address (if you edit while not logged in) and any public contributions to the Wikimedia Sites, is archived and displayed indefinitely by design; the transparency of the projects\u2019 contribution and revision histories is critical to their efficacy and trustworthiness. To learn more about our data retention practices, see our data retention guidelines. For further information about how you may request access to or deletion of your Personal Information, or other rights you may have with respect to your Personal Information, see our FAQ.\nBack to top \nFor the protection of the Wikimedia Foundation and other users, if you do not agree with this Privacy Policy, you may not use the Wikimedia Sites.\nThe Wikimedia Foundation is a non-profit organization based in San Francisco, California, with servers and data centers located in the U.S. If you decide to use Wikimedia Sites, whether from inside or outside of the U.S., you understand that your Personal Information will be collected, transferred, stored, processed, disclosed and otherwise used in the U.S. as described in this Privacy Policy. You also understand that your information may be transferred by us from the U.S. to other countries, which may have different or less stringent data protection laws than your country, in connection with providing services to you.\nBack to top \nWe do not allow tracking by third-party websites you have not visited.\nWe do not share your data with third parties for marketing purposes.\nWe are strongly committed to not sharing nonpublic information and Personal Information with third parties. In particular, we do not allow tracking by third-party websites you have not visited (including analytics services, advertising networks, and social platforms), nor do we share your Personal Information with any third parties for marketing purposes. Under this Policy, we may share your information only under particular situations, which you can learn more about in the \u201cWhen May We Share Your Information\u201d section of this Privacy Policy.\nBecause we protect all users in this manner, we do not change our behavior in response to a web browser's \"do not track\" signal.\nFor more information regarding Do Not Track signals and how we handle them, please visit our FAQ.\nBack to top \nSubstantial changes to this Policy will not be made until after a public comment period of at least 30 days.\nBecause things naturally change over time and we want to ensure our Privacy Policy accurately reflects our practices and the law, it may be necessary to modify this Privacy Policy from time to time. We reserve the right to do so in the following manner:\n---In the event of substantial changes, we will provide the proposed changes to our users in at least three (3) languages (selected at our discretion) for open comment period lasting at least thirty (30) calendar days. Prior to the start of any comment period, we will provide notice of such changes and the opportunity to comment via the Wikimedia Sites, and via a notification on WikimediaAnnounce-L or a similar mailing list.\n---For minor changes, such as grammatical fixes, administrative or legal changes, or corrections of inaccurate statements, we will post the changes and, when possible, provide at least three (3) calendar days' prior notice via WikimediaAnnounce-L or similar mailing list.\nWe ask that you please review the most up-to-date version of our Privacy Policy. Your continued use of the Wikimedia Sites after this Privacy Policy becomes effective constitutes acceptance of this Privacy Policy on your part. Your continued use of the Wikimedia Sites after any subsequent version of this Privacy Policy becomes effective, following notice as outlined above, constitutes acceptance of that version of the Privacy Policy on your part.\nIf you have questions or suggestions about this Privacy Policy, or the information collected under this Privacy Policy, please email us at privacy@wikimedia.org or contact us directly.\nDepending on your jurisdiction, you also may have the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority competent for your country or region.\nThank you for reading our Privacy Policy.

It is simply a handy reference for understanding the full terms. Think of it as the user-friendly interface to the legal language of our Terms of Use.\nPart of our mission is to:\n---Empower and Engage people around the world to collect and develop educational content and either publish it under a free license or dedicate it to the public domain.\n---Disseminate this content effectively and globally, free of charge.\nYou are free to:\n---Read and Print our articles and other media free of charge.\n---Share and Reuse our articles and other media under free and open licenses.\n---Contribute To and Edit our various sites or Projects.\nUnder the following conditions:\n---Responsibility \u2013 You take responsibility for your edits (since we only host your content).\n---Civility \u2013 You support a civil environment and do not harass other users.\n---Lawful Behavior \u2013 You do not violate copyright or other laws.\n---No Harm \u2013 You do not harm our technology infrastructure.\n---Terms of Use and Policies \u2013 You adhere to the below Terms of Use and to the applicable community policies when you visit our sites or participate in our communities.\nWith the understanding that:\n---You License Freely Your Contributions \u2013 you generally must license your contributions and edits to our sites or Projects under a free and open license (unless your contribution is in the public domain).\n---No Professional Advice \u2013 the content of articles and other projects is for informational purposes only and does not constitute professional advice. \nImagine a world in which every single human being can freely share in the sum of all knowledge.  That's our commitment. \u2013 \nOur Vision Statement\nWelcome to Wikimedia!  The Wikimedia Foundation, Inc. (\u201cwe\u201d or \u201cus\u201d), is a nonprofit charitable organization whose mission is to empower and engage people around the world to collect and develop content under a free license or in the public domain, and to disseminate it effectively and globally, free of charge.\nTo support our vibrant community, we provide the essential infrastructure and organizational framework for the development of multilingual wiki Projects and their editions (as explained here) and other endeavors which serve this mission. We strive to make and keep educational and informational content from the Projects available on the internet free of charge, in perpetuity.\nWe welcome you (\u201cyou\u201d or the \u201cuser\u201d) as a reader, editor, author, or contributor of the Wikimedia Projects, and we encourage you to join the Wikimedia community. Before you participate, however, we ask that you please read and agree to the following Terms of Use (\u201cTerms of Use\u201d).\nThese Terms of Use tell you about our public services at the Wikimedia Foundation, our relationship to you as a user, and the rights and responsibilities that guide us both.  We want you to know that we host an incredible quantity of educational and informational content, all of which is contributed and made possible by users like yourself.  Generally we do not contribute, monitor, or delete content (with the rare exception of policies like these Terms of Use or legal compliance for DMCA notices).  This means that editorial control is in the hands of you and your fellow users who create and manage the content.  We merely host this content.\nThe community \u2013 the network of users who are constantly building and using the various sites or Projects \u2013 are the principal means through which the goals of the mission are achieved.  The community contributes to and helps govern our sites.  The community undertakes the critical function of creating and enforcing policies for the specific Project editions (such as the different language editions for the Wikipedia Project or the Wikimedia Commons multi-lingual edition).\nYou are welcome to join as a contributor, editor, or author, but you should follow the policies that govern each of the independent Project editions.  The largest of our Projects is Wikipedia, but we host other Projects too, each with different objectives and work methods. Each Project edition has a team of contributors, editors or authors who work together to create and manage the content on that Project edition.  You are welcome to join these teams and work with them to improve these Projects. Because we are dedicated to making content freely accessible to the public, we generally require that all content you contribute is available under a free license or in the public domain.\nPlease be aware that you are legally responsible for all of your contributions, edits, and re-use of Wikimedia content under the laws of the United States of America and other applicable laws (which may include the laws where you live or where you view or edit content).  This means it is important that you use caution when posting content.  In light of this responsibility, we have some rules about what you cannot post, most of which is either for your own protection or for the protection of other users like yourself.  Please keep in mind that the content we host is for general informational purposes only, so if you need expert advice for a particular question (such as medical, legal, or financial issues), you should seek the help of a licensed or qualified professional.  We also include other important notices and disclaimers, so please read these Terms of Use in their entirety.\nFor clarity, other organizations, such as local Wikimedia chapters and associations, that may share in the same mission are nevertheless legally independent and separate from the Wikimedia Foundation and have no responsibility for the operations of the website or its content.\n---1 Our Terms of Use\n---2 Overview\n---3 1.

Other Terms\n---20 Thank You!\nThe Wikimedia Foundation is dedicated to encouraging the growth, development and distribution of free multilingual content, and to hosting the full content of these wiki-based Projects for the public free of charge.  Our role is to host some of the largest collaboratively edited reference Projects in the world, which can be found here. However, we act only as a hosting service, maintaining the infrastructure and organizational framework that allows our users to build the Wikimedia Projects by contributing and editing content themselves.  Because of our unique role, there are a couple of things you should be aware of when considering our relationship to you, the Projects, and the other users:\n---\nWe do not take an editorial role: Because the Wikimedia Projects are collaboratively edited, all of the content that we host is provided by users like yourself, and we do not take an editorial role.  This means that we generally do not monitor or edit the content of the Project websites, and we do not take any responsibility for this content.  Similarly, we do not endorse any opinions expressed via our services, and we do not represent or guarantee the truthfulness, accuracy, or reliability of any submitted community content.  Instead, we simply provide access to the content that your fellow users have contributed and edited.\n---\nYou are responsible for your own actions: You are legally responsible for your edits and contributions on Wikimedia Projects, so for your own protection you should exercise caution and avoid contributing any content that may result in criminal or civil liability under any applicable laws.  For clarity, applicable law includes at least the laws of the United States of America.  Although we may not agree with such actions, we warn editors and contributors that authorities may seek to apply other country laws to you, including local laws where you live or where you view or edit content. WMF generally cannot offer any protection, guarantee, immunity or indemnification.\nWe ask that you review the terms of our Privacy Policy, so that you are aware of how we collect and use your information. Because our services are used by people all over the world, personal information that we collect may be stored and processed in the United States of America or any other country in which we or our agents maintain facilities.  By using our services, you consent to any such transfer of information outside your country.\n---\nYou may find some material objectionable or erroneous: Because we provide a wide array of content that is produced or gathered by fellow users, you may encounter material that you find offensive, erroneous, misleading, mislabeled, or otherwise objectionable.  We therefore ask that you use common sense and proper judgment when using our services.\n---\nOur content is for general informational purposes only: Although we host a great deal of information that pertains to professional topics, including medical, legal, or financial issues, this content is presented for general informational purposes only. It should not be taken as professional advice.  Please seek independent professional counseling from someone who is licensed or qualified in the applicable area in lieu of acting on any information, opinion, or advice contained in one of the Project websites.\nThe Projects hosted by the Wikimedia Foundation only exist because of the vibrant community of users like you who collaborate to write, edit, and curate the content. We happily welcome your participation in this community. We encourage you to be civil and polite in your interactions with others in the community, to act in good faith, and to make edits and contributions aimed at furthering the mission of the shared Project.\nCertain activities, whether legal or illegal, may be harmful to other users and violate our rules, and some activities may also subject you to liability.  Therefore, for your own protection and for that of other users, you may not engage in such activities on our sites. These activities include:\nHarassing and Abusing Others\n---Engaging in harassment, threats, stalking, spamming, or vandalism; and\n---Transmitting chain mail, junk mail, or spam to other users.\nViolating the Privacy of Others\n---Infringing the privacy rights of others under the laws of the United States of America or other applicable laws (which may include the laws where you live or where you view or edit content);\n---Soliciting personally identifiable information for purposes of harassment, exploitation, violation of privacy, or any promotional or commercial purpose not explicitly approved by the Wikimedia Foundation; and\n---Soliciting personally identifiable information from anyone under the age of 18 for an illegal purpose or violating any applicable law regarding the health or well-being of minors.\nEngaging in False Statements, Impersonation, or Fraud\n---Intentionally or knowingly posting content that constitutes libel or defamation;\n---With the intent to deceive, posting content that is false or inaccurate;\n---Attempting to impersonate another user or individual, misrepresenting your affiliation with any individual or entity, or using the username of another user with the intent to deceive; and\n---Engaging in fraud.\nCommitting Infringement\n---Infringing copyrights, trademarks, patents, or other proprietary rights under applicable law.\nMisusing Our Services for Other Illegal Purposes\n---Posting child pornography or any other content that violates applicable law concerning child pornography;\n---Posting or trafficking in obscene material that is unlawful under applicable law; and\n---Using the services in a manner that is inconsistent with applicable law.\nEngaging in Disruptive and Illegal Misuse of Facilities\n---Posting or distributing content that contains any viruses, malware, worms, Trojan horses, malicious code, or other device that could harm our technical infrastructure or system or that of our users;\n---Engaging in automated uses of the site that are abusive or disruptive of the services and have not been approved by the Wikimedia community;\n---Disrupting the services by placing an undue burden on a Project website or the networks or servers connected with a Project website;\n---Disrupting the services by inundating any of the Project websites with communications or other traffic that suggests no serious intent to use the Project website for its stated purpose;\n---Knowingly accessing, tampering with, or using any of our non-public areas in our computer systems without authorization; and\n---Probing, scanning, or testing the vulnerability of any of our technical systems or networks unless all the following conditions are met:\n---such actions do not unduly abuse or disrupt our technical systems or networks;\n---such actions are not for personal gain (except for credit for your work);\n---you report any vulnerabilities to MediaWiki developers (or fix it yourself); and\n---you do not undertake such actions with malicious or destructive intent.\nPaid contributions without disclosure\nThese Terms of Use prohibit engaging in deceptive activities, including misrepresentation of affiliation, impersonation, and fraud. As part of these obligations, you must disclose your employer, client, and affiliation with respect to any contribution for which you receive, or expect to receive, compensation. You must make that disclosure in at least one of the following ways:\n---a statement on your user page,\n---a statement on the talk page accompanying any paid contributions, or\n---a statement in the edit summary accompanying any paid contributions.\nApplicable law, or community and Foundation policies and guidelines, such as those addressing conflicts of interest, may further limit paid contributions or require more detailed disclosure.\nA Wikimedia Project community may adopt an alternative paid contribution disclosure policy. If a Project adopts an alternative disclosure policy, you may comply with that policy instead of the requirements in this section when contributing to that Project. An alternative paid contribution policy will only supersede these requirements if it is approved by the relevant Project community and listed in the alternative disclosure policy page.\nFor more information, please read our FAQ on disclosure of paid contributions.\nWe reserve the right to exercise our enforcement discretion with respect to the above terms.\nYou are responsible for safeguarding your own password and should never disclose it to any third party.\nAlthough you have considerable freedoms for re-use of the content on the Project websites, it is important that, at the Wikimedia Foundation, we protect our trademark rights so that we can protect our users from fraudulent impersonators.  Because of this, we ask that you please respect our trademarks.  All Wikimedia Foundation trademarks belong to the Wikimedia Foundation, and any use of our trade names, trademarks, service marks, logos, or domain names must be in compliance with these Terms of Use and in compliance with our Trademark Policy.\nTo grow the commons of free knowledge and free culture, all users contributing to the Projects are required to grant broad permissions to the general public to re-distribute and re-use their contributions freely, so long as that use is properly attributed and the same freedom to re-use and re-distribute is granted to any derivative works.  In keeping with our goal of providing free information to the widest possible audience, we require that when necessary all submitted content be licensed so that it is freely reusable by anyone who cares to access it.\nYou agree to the following licensing requirements:\n---\nText to which you hold the copyright: When you submit text to which you hold the copyright, you agree to license it under:\nCreative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License (\u201cCC BY-SA\u201d), and\nGNU Free Documentation License (\u201cGFDL\u201d) (unversioned, with no invariant sections, front-cover texts, or back-cover texts).\n(Re-users may comply with either license or both.)\nThe only exception is if the Project edition or feature requires a different license.  In that case, you agree to license any text you contribute under that particular license.  For example, at the publication of this version of the Terms of Use, English Wikinews mandates that all text content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 2.5 Generic License (CC BY 2.5) and does not require a dual license with GFDL.\nPlease note that these licenses do allow commercial uses of your contributions, as long as such uses are compliant with the terms.\n---Attribution: Attribution is an important part of these licenses.  We consider it giving credit where credit is due \u2013 to authors like yourself.  When you contribute text, you agree to be attributed in any of the following fashions:\nThrough hyperlink (where possible) or URL to the article to which you contributed (since each article has a history page that lists all authors and editors);\nThrough hyperlink (where possible) or URL to an alternative, stable online copy that is freely accessible, which conforms with the license, and which provides credit to the authors in a manner equivalent to the credit given on the Project website; or\nThrough a list of all authors (but please note that any list of authors may be filtered to exclude very small or irrelevant contributions).\n---\nImporting text: You may import text that you have found elsewhere or that you have co-authored with others, but in such case you warrant that the text is available under terms that are compatible with the CC BY-SA 3.0 license (or, as explained above, another license when exceptionally required by the Project edition or feature)(\"CC BY-SA\"). Content available only under GFDL is not permissible.\nYou agree that, if you import text under a CC BY-SA license that requires attribution, you must credit the author(s) in a reasonable fashion.  Where such credit is commonly given through page histories (such as Wikimedia-internal copying), it is sufficient to give attribution in the edit summary, which is recorded in the page history, when importing the text.  The attribution requirements are sometimes too intrusive for particular circumstances (regardless of the license), and there may be instances where the Wikimedia community decides that imported text cannot be used for that reason.\n---\nNon-text media: Non-text media on the Projects are available under a variety of different licenses that support the general goal of allowing unrestricted re-use and re-distribution. When you contribute non-text media, you agree to comply with the requirements for such licenses as described in our Licensing Policy, and also comply with the requirements of the specific Project edition or feature to which you are contributing.   Also see the Wikimedia Commons Licensing Policy for more information on contributing non-text media to that Project.\n---\nNo revocation of license:  Except as consistent with your license, you agree that you will not unilaterally revoke or seek invalidation of any license that you have granted under these Terms of Use for text content or non-text media contributed to the Wikimedia Projects or features, even if you terminate use of our services.\n---\nPublic domain content: Content that is in the public domain is welcome!  It is important however that you confirm the public domain status of the content under the law of the United States of America as well as the laws of any other countries as required by the specific Project edition.  When you contribute content that is in the public domain, you warrant that the material is actually in the public domain, and you agree to label it appropriately.\n---\nRe-use: Re-use of content that we host is welcome, though exceptions exist for content contributed under \"fair use\" or similar exemptions under copyright law.  Any re-use must comply with the underlying license(s).\nWhen you re-use or re-distribute a text page developed by the Wikimedia community, you agree to attribute the authors in any of the following fashions:\nThrough hyperlink (where possible) or URL to the page or pages that you are re-using (since each page has a history page that lists all authors and editors);\nThrough hyperlink (where possible) or URL to an alternative, stable online copy that is freely accessible, which conforms with the license, and which provides credit to the authors in a manner equivalent to the credit given on the Project website; or\nThrough a list of all authors (but please note that any list of authors may be filtered to exclude very small or irrelevant contributions).\nIf the text content was imported from another source, it is possible that the content is licensed under a compatible CC BY-SA license but not GFDL (as described in \u201cImporting text,\u201d above).  In that case, you agree to comply with the compatible CC BY-SA license and do not have the option to re-license it under GFDL.  To determine the license that applies to the content that you seek to re-use or re-distribute, you should review the page footer, page history, and discussion page.\nIn addition, please be aware that text that originated from external sources and was imported into a Project may be under a license that attaches additional attribution requirements.  Users agree to indicate these additional attribution requirements clearly.  Depending on the Project, such requirements may appear for example in a banner or other notations pointing out that some or all of the content was originally published elsewhere.  Where there are such visible notations, re-users should preserve them.\nFor any non-text media, you agree to comply with whatever license under which the work has been made available (which can be discovered by clicking on the work and looking at the licensing section on its description page or reviewing an applicable source page for that work).  When re-using any content that we host, you agree to comply with the relevant attribution requirements as they pertain to the underlying license or licenses.\n---\nModifications or additions to material that you re-use: When modifying or making additions to text that you have obtained from a Project website, you agree to license the modified or added content under CC BY-SA 3.0 or later (or, as explained above, another license when exceptionally required by the specific Project edition or feature).\nWhen modifying or making additions to any non-text media that you have obtained from a Project website, you agree to license the modified or added content in accordance with whatever license under which the work has been made available.\nWith both text content and non-text media, you agree to clearly indicate that the original work has been modified.  If you are re-using text content in a wiki, it is sufficient to indicate in the page history that you made a change to the imported text.  For each copy or modified version that you distribute, you agree to include a licensing notice stating which license the work is released under, along with either a hyperlink or URL to the text of the license or a copy of the license itself.\nThe Wikimedia Foundation wants to ensure that the content that we host can be re-used by other users without fear of liability and that it is not infringing the proprietary rights of others. In fairness to our users, as well as to other creators and copyright holders, our policy is to respond to notices of alleged infringement that comply with the formalities of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA).  Pursuant to the DMCA, we will terminate, in appropriate circumstances, users and account holders of our system and network who are repeat infringers.\nHowever, we also recognize that not every takedown notice is valid or in good faith.  In such cases, we strongly encourage users to file counter-notifications when they appropriately believe a DMCA takedown demand is invalid or improper.  For more information on what to do if you think a DMCA notice has been improperly filed, you may wish to consult the Chilling Effects website.\nIf you are the owner of content that is being improperly used on one of the Projects without your permission, you may request that the content be removed under the DMCA.  To make such a request, please email us at legalwikimedia.org or snail mail our designated agent at this address.\nAlternatively, you may make a request to our community, which often handles copyright issues faster and more effectively than prescribed under the DMCA.  In that case, you can post a notice explaining your copyright concerns.  For a non-exhaustive and non-authoritative list of the relevant processes for the different Project editions, look here. Before filing a DMCA claim, you also have the option of sending an email to the community at infowikimedia.org.\nYou are solely responsible for your use of any third-party websites or resources.  Although the Projects contain links to third-party websites and resources, we do not endorse and are not responsible or liable for their availability, accuracy, or the related content, products, or services (including, without limitation, any viruses or other disabling features), nor do we have any obligation to monitor such third-party content.\nThe community has the primary role in creating and enforcing policies applying to the different Project editions.  At the Wikimedia Foundation, we rarely intervene in community decisions about policy and its enforcement.  In an unusual case, the need may arise, or the community may ask us, to address an especially problematic user because of significant Project disturbance or dangerous behavior.  In such cases, we reserve the right, but do not have the obligation to:\n---Investigate your use of the service (a) to determine whether a violation of these Terms of Use, Project edition policy, or other applicable law or policy has occurred, or (b) to comply with any applicable law, legal process, or appropriate governmental request;\n---Detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security, or technical issues or respond to user support requests;\n---Refuse, disable, or restrict access to the contribution of any user who violates these Terms of Use;\n---Ban a user from editing or contributing or block a user's account or access for actions violating these Terms of Use, including repeat copyright infringement;\n---Take legal action against users who violate these Terms of Use (including reports to law enforcement authorities); and\n---Manage otherwise the Project websites in a manner designed to facilitate their proper functioning and protect the rights, property, and safety of ourselves and our users, licensors, partners, and the public.\nIn the interests of our users and the Projects, in the extreme circumstance that any individual has had his or her account or access blocked under this provision, he or she is prohibited from creating or using another account on or seeking access to the same Project, unless we provide explicit permission.  Without limiting the authority of the community, the Wikimedia Foundation itself will not ban a user from editing or contributing or block a user's account or access solely because of good faith criticism that does not result in actions otherwise violating these Terms of Use or community policies.\nThe Wikimedia community and its members may also take action when so allowed by the community or Foundation policies applicable to the specific Project edition, including but not limited to warning, investigating, blocking, or banning users who violate those policies.  You agree to comply with the final decisions of dispute resolution bodies that are established by the community for the specific Project editions (such as arbitration committees); these decisions may include sanctions as set out by the policy of the specific Project edition.\nEspecially problematic users who have had accounts or access blocked on multiple Project editions may be subject to a ban from all of the Project editions, in accordance with the Global Ban Policy.  In contrast to Board resolutions or these Terms of Use, policies established by the community, which may cover a single Project edition or multiple Projects editions (like the Global Ban Policy), may be modified by the relevant community according to its own procedures.\nThe blocking of an account or access or the banning of a user under this provision shall be in accordance with Section 12 of these Terms of Use.\nThe Wikimedia Foundation Board of Trustees releases official policies from time to time.  Some of these policies may be mandatory for a particular Project or Project edition, and, when they are, you agree to abide by them as applicable.\nThough we hope you will stay and continue to contribute to the Projects, you can stop using our services any time.  In certain (hopefully unlikely) circumstances it may be necessary for either ourselves or the Wikimedia community or its members (as described in Section 10) to terminate part or all of our services, terminate these Terms of Use, block your account or access, or ban you as a user.  If your account or access is blocked or otherwise terminated for any reason, your public contributions will remain publicly available (subject to applicable policies), and, unless we notify you otherwise, you may still access our public pages for the sole purpose of reading publicly available content on the Projects.  In such circumstances, however, you may not be able to access your account or settings.  We reserve the right to suspend or end the services at any time, with or without cause, and with or without notice.  Even after your use and participation are banned, blocked or otherwise suspended, these Terms of Use will remain in effect with respect to relevant provisions, including Sections 1, 3, 4, 6, 7, 9-15, and 17.\nHighlighted for emphasis\nWe hope that no serious disagreements arise involving you, but, in the event there is a dispute, we encourage you to seek resolution through the dispute resolution procedures or mechanisms provided by the Projects or Project editions and the Wikimedia Foundation. If you seek to file a legal claim against us, you agree to file and resolve it exclusively in a state or federal court located in San Francisco County, California.  You also agree that the laws of the State of California and, to the extent applicable, the laws of the United States of America will govern these Terms of Use, as well as any legal claim that might arise between you and us (without reference to conflict of laws principles).  You agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of, and agree that venue is proper in, the courts located in San Francisco County, California, in any legal action or proceeding relating to us or these Terms of Use.\nTo ensure that disputes are dealt with soon after they arise, you agree that regardless of any statute or law to the contrary, any claim or cause of action you might have arising out of or related to use of our services or these Terms of Use must be filed within the applicable statute of limitations or, if earlier, one (1) year after the pertinent facts underlying such claim or cause of action could have been discovered with reasonable diligence (or be forever barred).\nHighlighted for emphasis\nAt the Wikimedia Foundation, we do our best to provide educational and informational content to a very wide audience, but your use of our services is at your sole risk.  We provide these services on an \"as is\" and \"as available\" basis, and we expressly disclaim all express or implied warranties of all kinds, including but not limited to the implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and non-infringement.  We make no warranty that our services will meet your requirements, be safe, secure, uninterrupted, timely, accurate, or error-free, or that your information will be secure.\nWe are not responsible for the content, data, or actions of third parties, and you release us, our directors, officers, employees, and agents from any claims and damages, known and unknown, arising out of or in any way connected with any claim you have against any such third parties.  No advice or information, whether oral or written, obtained by you from us or through or from our services creates any warranty not expressly stated in these Terms of Use.\nAny material downloaded or otherwise obtained through your use of our services is done at your own discretion and risk, and you will be solely responsible for any damage to your computer system or loss of data that results from the download of any such material.  You agree that we have no responsibility or liability for the deletion of, or the failure to store or to transmit, any content or communication maintained by the service.  We retain the right to create limits on use and storage at our sole discretion at any time with or without notice.\nSome states or jurisdictions do not allow the types of disclaimers in this section, so they may not apply to you either in part or in full depending on the law.\nHighlighted for emphasis\nThe Wikimedia Foundation will not be liable to you or to any other party for any direct, indirect, incidental, special, consequential or exemplary damages, including but not limited to, damages for loss of profits, goodwill, use, data, or other intangible losses, regardless of whether we were advised of the possibility of such damage.  In no event shall our liability exceed one thousand U.S. dollars (USD 1000.00) in aggregate.  In the case that applicable law may not allow the limitation or exclusion of liability or incidental or consequential damages, the above limitation or exclusion may not apply to you, although our liability will be limited to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law.\nJust as the Wikimedia community's input is essential for the growth and maintenance of the Projects, we believe that community input is essential for these Terms of Use to properly serve our users.  It is also essential for a fair contract.  Therefore, we will provide these Terms of Use, as well as any substantial future revisions of these Terms of Use, to the community for comment at least thirty (30) days before the end of the comment period. If a future proposed revision is substantial, we will provide an additional 30 days for comments after posting a translation of the proposed revision in at least three languages (selected at our discretion).  The community will be encouraged to translate the proposed revision in other languages as appropriate.  For changes for legal or administrative reasons, to correct an inaccurate statement, or changes in response to community comments, we will provide at least three (3) days' notice.\nBecause it may be necessary to modify these Terms of Use from time to time, we will provide notice of such modifications and the opportunity to comment via the Project websites, and via a notification on WikimediaAnnounce-L. However, we ask that you please periodically review the most up-to-date version of these Terms of Use.  Your continued use of our services after the new Terms of Use become official following the notice and review period constitutes an acceptance of these Terms of Use on your part.  For the protection of the Wikimedia Foundation and other users like yourself, if you do not agree with our Terms of Use, you cannot use our services.\nThese Terms of Use do not create an employment, agency, partnership, or joint venture relationship between you and us, the Wikimedia Foundation.  If you have not signed a separate agreement with us, these Terms of Use are the entire agreement between you and us.  If there is any conflict between these Terms of Use and a signed written agreement between you and us, the signed agreement will control.\nYou agree that we may provide you with notices, including those regarding changes to the Terms of Use, by email, regular mail, or postings on Project websites.\nIf in any circumstance, we do not apply or enforce any provision of these Terms of Use, it is not a waiver of that provision.\nYou understand that, unless otherwise agreed to in writing by us, you have no expectation of compensation for any activity, contribution, or idea that you provide to us, the community, or the Wikimedia Projects or Project editions.\nNotwithstanding any provision to the contrary in these Terms of Use, we (the Wikimedia Foundation) and you agree not to modify the applicable terms and requirements of any free license that is employed on the Projects or Project editions when such free license is authorized by these Terms of Use.\nThese Terms of Use were written in English (U.S.).  While we hope that translations of these Terms of Use are accurate, in the event of any differences in meaning between the original English version and a translation, the original English version takes precedence.\nIf any provision or part of a provision of these Terms of Use is found unlawful, void, or unenforceable, that provision or part of the provision is deemed severable from these Terms of Use and will be enforced to the maximum extent permissible, and all other provisions of these Terms of Use will remain in full force and effect.\nWe appreciate your taking the time to read these Terms of Use, and we are very happy to have you contributing to the Projects and using our services.  Through your contributions, you are helping to build something really big \u2013 not only an important collection of collaboratively edited reference Projects that provides education and information to millions who might otherwise lack access, but also a vibrant community of like-minded and engaged peers, focused on a very noble goal.\nThese Terms of Use went into effect on June 16, 2014. Previous versions of the terms:\n---Terms of Use (2012\u20132014): effective from May 24, 2012 until June 16, 2014\n---Terms of Use (2009): effective from 2009 until May 24, 2012.\nIn the event of any differences in meaning between the original English version and a translation, the original English version takes precedence.\nCategories: ---Terms of Use---PolicyHidden category: ---Governance wiki\n", "https://wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Terms_of_use": "\nTerms of Use - Wikimedia Foundation Governance Wiki\nFrom the Wikimedia Foundation Governance Wiki\n< Terms of Use(Redirected from Terms of Use)\nJump to navigation\nJump to search\n In other languages\nEnglish \u00a0\u00b7 \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0631\u0628\u064a\u0629\u00a0\u00b7 asturianu\u00a0\u00b7 \u0431\u044a\u043b\u0433\u0430\u0440\u0441\u043a\u0438\u00a0\u00b7 \u09ac\u09be\u0982\u09b2\u09be\u00a0\u00b7 catal\u00e0\u00a0\u00b7 \u010de\u0161tina\u00a0\u00b7 Deutsch\u00a0\u00b7 English\u00a0\u00b7 espa\u00f1ol\u00a0\u00b7 suomi\u00a0\u00b7 fran\u00e7ais\u00a0\u00b7 galego\u00a0\u00b7 \u05e2\u05d1\u05e8\u05d9\u05ea\u00a0\u00b7 Bahasa Indonesia\u00a0\u00b7 italiano\u00a0\u00b7 \u65e5\u672c\u8a9e\u00a0\u00b7 \ud55c\uad6d\uc5b4\u00a0\u00b7 \u043c\u0430\u043a\u0435\u0434\u043e\u043d\u0441\u043a\u0438\u00a0\u00b7 \u0d2e\u0d32\u0d2f\u0d3e\u0d33\u0d02\u00a0\u00b7 Nederlands\u00a0\u00b7 polski\u00a0\u00b7 portugu\u00eas do Brasil\u00a0\u00b7 \u0440\u0443\u0441\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439\u00a0\u00b7 \u0e44\u0e17\u0e22\u00a0\u00b7 \u0443\u043a\u0440\u0430\u0457\u043d\u0441\u044c\u043a\u0430\u00a0\u00b7 Ti\u1ebfng Vi\u1ec7t\nThis is a summary of the Terms of Use.  To read the full terms, scroll down or click here.\n \nTerms of Use\nThis is a human-readable summary of the Terms of Use.\nDisclaimer: This summary is not a part of the Terms of Use and is not a legal document. It is simply a handy reference for understanding the full terms. Think of it as the user-friendly interface to the legal language of our Terms of Use.\nPart of our mission is to:\n---Empower and Engage people around the world to collect and develop educational content and either publish it under a free license or dedicate it to the public domain.\n---Disseminate this content effectively and globally, free of charge.\nYou are free to:\n---Read and Print our articles and other media free of charge.\n---Share and Reuse our articles and other media under free and open licenses.\n---Contribute To and Edit our various sites or Projects.\nUnder the following conditions:\n---Responsibility \u2013 You take responsibility for your edits (since we only host your content).\n---Civility \u2013 You support a civil environment and do not harass other users.\n---Lawful Behavior \u2013 You do not violate copyright or other laws.\n---No Harm \u2013 You do not harm our technology infrastructure.\n---Terms of Use and Policies \u2013 You adhere to the below Terms of Use and to the applicable community policies when you visit our sites or participate in our communities.\nWith the understanding that:\n---You License Freely Your Contributions \u2013 you generally must license your contributions and edits to our sites or Projects under a free and open license (unless your contribution is in the public domain).\n---No Professional Advice \u2013 the content of articles and other projects is for informational purposes only and does not constitute professional advice. \nImagine a world in which every single human being can freely share in the sum of all knowledge.  That's our commitment. \u2013 \nOur Vision Statement\nWelcome to Wikimedia!  The Wikimedia Foundation, Inc. (\u201cwe\u201d or \u201cus\u201d), is a nonprofit charitable organization whose mission is to empower and engage people around the world to collect and develop content under a free license or in the public domain, and to disseminate it effectively and globally, free of charge.\nTo support our vibrant community, we provide the essential infrastructure and organizational framework for the development of multilingual wiki Projects and their editions (as explained here) and other endeavors which serve this mission. We strive to make and keep educational and informational content from the Projects available on the internet free of charge, in perpetuity.\nWe welcome you (\u201cyou\u201d or the \u201cuser\u201d) as a reader, editor, author, or contributor of the Wikimedia Projects, and we encourage you to join the Wikimedia community. Before you participate, however, we ask that you please read and agree to the following Terms of Use (\u201cTerms of Use\u201d).\nThese Terms of Use tell you about our public services at the Wikimedia Foundation, our relationship to you as a user, and the rights and responsibilities that guide us both.  We want you to know that we host an incredible quantity of educational and informational content, all of which is contributed and made possible by users like yourself.  Generally we do not contribute, monitor, or delete content (with the rare exception of policies like these Terms of Use or legal compliance for DMCA notices).  This means that editorial control is in the hands of you and your fellow users who create and manage the content.  We merely host this content.\nThe community \u2013 the network of users who are constantly building and using the various sites or Projects \u2013 are the principal means through which the goals of the mission are achieved.  The community contributes to and helps govern our sites.  The community undertakes the critical function of creating and enforcing policies for the specific Project editions (such as the different language editions for the Wikipedia Project or the Wikimedia Commons multi-lingual edition).\nYou are welcome to join as a contributor, editor, or author, but you should follow the policies that govern each of the independent Project editions.  The largest of our Projects is Wikipedia, but we host other Projects too, each with different objectives and work methods. Each Project edition has a team of contributors, editors or authors who work together to create and manage the content on that Project edition.  You are welcome to join these teams and work with them to improve these Projects. Because we are dedicated to making content freely accessible to the public, we generally require that all content you contribute is available under a free license or in the public domain.\nPlease be aware that you are legally responsible for all of your contributions, edits, and re-use of Wikimedia content under the laws of the United States of America and other applicable laws (which may include the laws where you live or where you view or edit content).  This means it is important that you use caution when posting content.  In light of this responsibility, we have some rules about what you cannot post, most of which is either for your own protection or for the protection of other users like yourself.  Please keep in mind that the content we host is for general informational purposes only, so if you need expert advice for a particular question (such as medical, legal, or financial issues), you should seek the help of a licensed or qualified professional.  We also include other important notices and disclaimers, so please read these Terms of Use in their entirety.\nFor clarity, other organizations, such as local Wikimedia chapters and associations, that may share in the same mission are nevertheless legally independent and separate from the Wikimedia Foundation and have no responsibility for the operations of the website or its content.\n---1 Our Terms of Use\n---2 Overview\n---3 1.

Other Terms\n---20 Thank You!\nThe Wikimedia Foundation is dedicated to encouraging the growth, development and distribution of free multilingual content, and to hosting the full content of these wiki-based Projects for the public free of charge.  Our role is to host some of the largest collaboratively edited reference Projects in the world, which can be found here. However, we act only as a hosting service, maintaining the infrastructure and organizational framework that allows our users to build the Wikimedia Projects by contributing and editing content themselves.  Because of our unique role, there are a couple of things you should be aware of when considering our relationship to you, the Projects, and the other users:\n---\nWe do not take an editorial role: Because the Wikimedia Projects are collaboratively edited, all of the content that we host is provided by users like yourself, and we do not take an editorial role.  This means that we generally do not monitor or edit the content of the Project websites, and we do not take any responsibility for this content.  Similarly, we do not endorse any opinions expressed via our services, and we do not represent or guarantee the truthfulness, accuracy, or reliability of any submitted community content.  Instead, we simply provide access to the content that your fellow users have contributed and edited.\n---\nYou are responsible for your own actions: You are legally responsible for your edits and contributions on Wikimedia Projects, so for your own protection you should exercise caution and avoid contributing any content that may result in criminal or civil liability under any applicable laws.  For clarity, applicable law includes at least the laws of the United States of America.  Although we may not agree with such actions, we warn editors and contributors that authorities may seek to apply other country laws to you, including local laws where you live or where you view or edit content. WMF generally cannot offer any protection, guarantee, immunity or indemnification.\nWe ask that you review the terms of our Privacy Policy, so that you are aware of how we collect and use your information. Because our services are used by people all over the world, personal information that we collect may be stored and processed in the United States of America or any other country in which we or our agents maintain facilities.  By using our services, you consent to any such transfer of information outside your country.\n---\nYou may find some material objectionable or erroneous: Because we provide a wide array of content that is produced or gathered by fellow users, you may encounter material that you find offensive, erroneous, misleading, mislabeled, or otherwise objectionable.  We therefore ask that you use common sense and proper judgment when using our services.\n---\nOur content is for general informational purposes only: Although we host a great deal of information that pertains to professional topics, including medical, legal, or financial issues, this content is presented for general informational purposes only. It should not be taken as professional advice.  Please seek independent professional counseling from someone who is licensed or qualified in the applicable area in lieu of acting on any information, opinion, or advice contained in one of the Project websites.\nThe Projects hosted by the Wikimedia Foundation only exist because of the vibrant community of users like you who collaborate to write, edit, and curate the content. We happily welcome your participation in this community. We encourage you to be civil and polite in your interactions with others in the community, to act in good faith, and to make edits and contributions aimed at furthering the mission of the shared Project.\nCertain activities, whether legal or illegal, may be harmful to other users and violate our rules, and some activities may also subject you to liability.  Therefore, for your own protection and for that of other users, you may not engage in such activities on our sites. These activities include:\nHarassing and Abusing Others\n---Engaging in harassment, threats, stalking, spamming, or vandalism; and\n---Transmitting chain mail, junk mail, or spam to other users.\nViolating the Privacy of Others\n---Infringing the privacy rights of others under the laws of the United States of America or other applicable laws (which may include the laws where you live or where you view or edit content);\n---Soliciting personally identifiable information for purposes of harassment, exploitation, violation of privacy, or any promotional or commercial purpose not explicitly approved by the Wikimedia Foundation; and\n---Soliciting personally identifiable information from anyone under the age of 18 for an illegal purpose or violating any applicable law regarding the health or well-being of minors.\nEngaging in False Statements, Impersonation, or Fraud\n---Intentionally or knowingly posting content that constitutes libel or defamation;\n---With the intent to deceive, posting content that is false or inaccurate;\n---Attempting to impersonate another user or individual, misrepresenting your affiliation with any individual or entity, or using the username of another user with the intent to deceive; and\n---Engaging in fraud.\nCommitting Infringement\n---Infringing copyrights, trademarks, patents, or other proprietary rights under applicable law.\nMisusing Our Services for Other Illegal Purposes\n---Posting child pornography or any other content that violates applicable law concerning child pornography;\n---Posting or trafficking in obscene material that is unlawful under applicable law; and\n---Using the services in a manner that is inconsistent with applicable law.\nEngaging in Disruptive and Illegal Misuse of Facilities\n---Posting or distributing content that contains any viruses, malware, worms, Trojan horses, malicious code, or other device that could harm our technical infrastructure or system or that of our users;\n---Engaging in automated uses of the site that are abusive or disruptive of the services and have not been approved by the Wikimedia community;\n---Disrupting the services by placing an undue burden on a Project website or the networks or servers connected with a Project website;\n---Disrupting the services by inundating any of the Project websites with communications or other traffic that suggests no serious intent to use the Project website for its stated purpose;\n---Knowingly accessing, tampering with, or using any of our non-public areas in our computer systems without authorization; and\n---Probing, scanning, or testing the vulnerability of any of our technical systems or networks unless all the following conditions are met:\n---such actions do not unduly abuse or disrupt our technical systems or networks;\n---such actions are not for personal gain (except for credit for your work);\n---you report any vulnerabilities to MediaWiki developers (or fix it yourself); and\n---you do not undertake such actions with malicious or destructive intent.\nPaid contributions without disclosure\nThese Terms of Use prohibit engaging in deceptive activities, including misrepresentation of affiliation, impersonation, and fraud. As part of these obligations, you must disclose your employer, client, and affiliation with respect to any contribution for which you receive, or expect to receive, compensation. You must make that disclosure in at least one of the following ways:\n---a statement on your user page,\n---a statement on the talk page accompanying any paid contributions, or\n---a statement in the edit summary accompanying any paid contributions.\nApplicable law, or community and Foundation policies and guidelines, such as those addressing conflicts of interest, may further limit paid contributions or require more detailed disclosure.\nA Wikimedia Project community may adopt an alternative paid contribution disclosure policy. If a Project adopts an alternative disclosure policy, you may comply with that policy instead of the requirements in this section when contributing to that Project. An alternative paid contribution policy will only supersede these requirements if it is approved by the relevant Project community and listed in the alternative disclosure policy page.\nFor more information, please read our FAQ on disclosure of paid contributions.\nWe reserve the right to exercise our enforcement discretion with respect to the above terms.\nYou are responsible for safeguarding your own password and should never disclose it to any third party.\nAlthough you have considerable freedoms for re-use of the content on the Project websites, it is important that, at the Wikimedia Foundation, we protect our trademark rights so that we can protect our users from fraudulent impersonators.  Because of this, we ask that you please respect our trademarks.  All Wikimedia Foundation trademarks belong to the Wikimedia Foundation, and any use of our trade names, trademarks, service marks, logos, or domain names must be in compliance with these Terms of Use and in compliance with our Trademark Policy.\nTo grow the commons of free knowledge and free culture, all users contributing to the Projects are required to grant broad permissions to the general public to re-distribute and re-use their contributions freely, so long as that use is properly attributed and the same freedom to re-use and re-distribute is granted to any derivative works.  In keeping with our goal of providing free information to the widest possible audience, we require that when necessary all submitted content be licensed so that it is freely reusable by anyone who cares to access it.\nYou agree to the following licensing requirements:\n---\nText to which you hold the copyright: When you submit text to which you hold the copyright, you agree to license it under:\nCreative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License (\u201cCC BY-SA\u201d), and\nGNU Free Documentation License (\u201cGFDL\u201d) (unversioned, with no invariant sections, front-cover texts, or back-cover texts).\n(Re-users may comply with either license or both.)\nThe only exception is if the Project edition or feature requires a different license.  In that case, you agree to license any text you contribute under that particular license.  For example, at the publication of this version of the Terms of Use, English Wikinews mandates that all text content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 2.5 Generic License (CC BY 2.5) and does not require a dual license with GFDL.\nPlease note that these licenses do allow commercial uses of your contributions, as long as such uses are compliant with the terms.\n---Attribution: Attribution is an important part of these licenses.  We consider it giving credit where credit is due \u2013 to authors like yourself.  When you contribute text, you agree to be attributed in any of the following fashions:\nThrough hyperlink (where possible) or URL to the article to which you contributed (since each article has a history page that lists all authors and editors);\nThrough hyperlink (where possible) or URL to an alternative, stable online copy that is freely accessible, which conforms with the license, and which provides credit to the authors in a manner equivalent to the credit given on the Project website; or\nThrough a list of all authors (but please note that any list of authors may be filtered to exclude very small or irrelevant contributions).\n---\nImporting text: You may import text that you have found elsewhere or that you have co-authored with others, but in such case you warrant that the text is available under terms that are compatible with the CC BY-SA 3.0 license (or, as explained above, another license when exceptionally required by the Project edition or feature)(\"CC BY-SA\"). Content available only under GFDL is not permissible.\nYou agree that, if you import text under a CC BY-SA license that requires attribution, you must credit the author(s) in a reasonable fashion.  Where such credit is commonly given through page histories (such as Wikimedia-internal copying), it is sufficient to give attribution in the edit summary, which is recorded in the page history, when importing the text.  The attribution requirements are sometimes too intrusive for particular circumstances (regardless of the license), and there may be instances where the Wikimedia community decides that imported text cannot be used for that reason.\n---\nNon-text media: Non-text media on the Projects are available under a variety of different licenses that support the general goal of allowing unrestricted re-use and re-distribution. When you contribute non-text media, you agree to comply with the requirements for such licenses as described in our Licensing Policy, and also comply with the requirements of the specific Project edition or feature to which you are contributing.   Also see the Wikimedia Commons Licensing Policy for more information on contributing non-text media to that Project.\n---\nNo revocation of license:  Except as consistent with your license, you agree that you will not unilaterally revoke or seek invalidation of any license that you have granted under these Terms of Use for text content or non-text media contributed to the Wikimedia Projects or features, even if you terminate use of our services.\n---\nPublic domain content: Content that is in the public domain is welcome!  It is important however that you confirm the public domain status of the content under the law of the United States of America as well as the laws of any other countries as required by the specific Project edition.  When you contribute content that is in the public domain, you warrant that the material is actually in the public domain, and you agree to label it appropriately.\n---\nRe-use: Re-use of content that we host is welcome, though exceptions exist for content contributed under \"fair use\" or similar exemptions under copyright law.  Any re-use must comply with the underlying license(s).\nWhen you re-use or re-distribute a text page developed by the Wikimedia community, you agree to attribute the authors in any of the following fashions:\nThrough hyperlink (where possible) or URL to the page or pages that you are re-using (since each page has a history page that lists all authors and editors);\nThrough hyperlink (where possible) or URL to an alternative, stable online copy that is freely accessible, which conforms with the license, and which provides credit to the authors in a manner equivalent to the credit given on the Project website; or\nThrough a list of all authors (but please note that any list of authors may be filtered to exclude very small or irrelevant contributions).\nIf the text content was imported from another source, it is possible that the content is licensed under a compatible CC BY-SA license but not GFDL (as described in \u201cImporting text,\u201d above).  In that case, you agree to comply with the compatible CC BY-SA license and do not have the option to re-license it under GFDL.  To determine the license that applies to the content that you seek to re-use or re-distribute, you should review the page footer, page history, and discussion page.\nIn addition, please be aware that text that originated from external sources and was imported into a Project may be under a license that attaches additional attribution requirements.  Users agree to indicate these additional attribution requirements clearly.  Depending on the Project, such requirements may appear for example in a banner or other notations pointing out that some or all of the content was originally published elsewhere.  Where there are such visible notations, re-users should preserve them.\nFor any non-text media, you agree to comply with whatever license under which the work has been made available (which can be discovered by clicking on the work and looking at the licensing section on its description page or reviewing an applicable source page for that work).  When re-using any content that we host, you agree to comply with the relevant attribution requirements as they pertain to the underlying license or licenses.\n---\nModifications or additions to material that you re-use: When modifying or making additions to text that you have obtained from a Project website, you agree to license the modified or added content under CC BY-SA 3.0 or later (or, as explained above, another license when exceptionally required by the specific Project edition or feature).\nWhen modifying or making additions to any non-text media that you have obtained from a Project website, you agree to license the modified or added content in accordance with whatever license under which the work has been made available.\nWith both text content and non-text media, you agree to clearly indicate that the original work has been modified.  If you are re-using text content in a wiki, it is sufficient to indicate in the page history that you made a change to the imported text.  For each copy or modified version that you distribute, you agree to include a licensing notice stating which license the work is released under, along with either a hyperlink or URL to the text of the license or a copy of the license itself.\nThe Wikimedia Foundation wants to ensure that the content that we host can be re-used by other users without fear of liability and that it is not infringing the proprietary rights of others. In fairness to our users, as well as to other creators and copyright holders, our policy is to respond to notices of alleged infringement that comply with the formalities of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA).  Pursuant to the DMCA, we will terminate, in appropriate circumstances, users and account holders of our system and network who are repeat infringers.\nHowever, we also recognize that not every takedown notice is valid or in good faith.  In such cases, we strongly encourage users to file counter-notifications when they appropriately believe a DMCA takedown demand is invalid or improper.  For more information on what to do if you think a DMCA notice has been improperly filed, you may wish to consult the Chilling Effects website.\nIf you are the owner of content that is being improperly used on one of the Projects without your permission, you may request that the content be removed under the DMCA.  To make such a request, please email us at legalwikimedia.org or snail mail our designated agent at this address.\nAlternatively, you may make a request to our community, which often handles copyright issues faster and more effectively than prescribed under the DMCA.  In that case, you can post a notice explaining your copyright concerns.  For a non-exhaustive and non-authoritative list of the relevant processes for the different Project editions, look here. Before filing a DMCA claim, you also have the option of sending an email to the community at infowikimedia.org.\nYou are solely responsible for your use of any third-party websites or resources.  Although the Projects contain links to third-party websites and resources, we do not endorse and are not responsible or liable for their availability, accuracy, or the related content, products, or services (including, without limitation, any viruses or other disabling features), nor do we have any obligation to monitor such third-party content.\nThe community has the primary role in creating and enforcing policies applying to the different Project editions.  At the Wikimedia Foundation, we rarely intervene in community decisions about policy and its enforcement.  In an unusual case, the need may arise, or the community may ask us, to address an especially problematic user because of significant Project disturbance or dangerous behavior.  In such cases, we reserve the right, but do not have the obligation to:\n---Investigate your use of the service (a) to determine whether a violation of these Terms of Use, Project edition policy, or other applicable law or policy has occurred, or (b) to comply with any applicable law, legal process, or appropriate governmental request;\n---Detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security, or technical issues or respond to user support requests;\n---Refuse, disable, or restrict access to the contribution of any user who violates these Terms of Use;\n---Ban a user from editing or contributing or block a user's account or access for actions violating these Terms of Use, including repeat copyright infringement;\n---Take legal action against users who violate these Terms of Use (including reports to law enforcement authorities); and\n---Manage otherwise the Project websites in a manner designed to facilitate their proper functioning and protect the rights, property, and safety of ourselves and our users, licensors, partners, and the public.\nIn the interests of our users and the Projects, in the extreme circumstance that any individual has had his or her account or access blocked under this provision, he or she is prohibited from creating or using another account on or seeking access to the same Project, unless we provide explicit permission.  Without limiting the authority of the community, the Wikimedia Foundation itself will not ban a user from editing or contributing or block a user's account or access solely because of good faith criticism that does not result in actions otherwise violating these Terms of Use or community policies.\nThe Wikimedia community and its members may also take action when so allowed by the community or Foundation policies applicable to the specific Project edition, including but not limited to warning, investigating, blocking, or banning users who violate those policies.  You agree to comply with the final decisions of dispute resolution bodies that are established by the community for the specific Project editions (such as arbitration committees); these decisions may include sanctions as set out by the policy of the specific Project edition.\nEspecially problematic users who have had accounts or access blocked on multiple Project editions may be subject to a ban from all of the Project editions, in accordance with the Global Ban Policy.  In contrast to Board resolutions or these Terms of Use, policies established by the community, which may cover a single Project edition or multiple Projects editions (like the Global Ban Policy), may be modified by the relevant community according to its own procedures.\nThe blocking of an account or access or the banning of a user under this provision shall be in accordance with Section 12 of these Terms of Use.\nThe Wikimedia Foundation Board of Trustees releases official policies from time to time.  Some of these policies may be mandatory for a particular Project or Project edition, and, when they are, you agree to abide by them as applicable.\nThough we hope you will stay and continue to contribute to the Projects, you can stop using our services any time.  In certain (hopefully unlikely) circumstances it may be necessary for either ourselves or the Wikimedia community or its members (as described in Section 10) to terminate part or all of our services, terminate these Terms of Use, block your account or access, or ban you as a user.  If your account or access is blocked or otherwise terminated for any reason, your public contributions will remain publicly available (subject to applicable policies), and, unless we notify you otherwise, you may still access our public pages for the sole purpose of reading publicly available content on the Projects.  In such circumstances, however, you may not be able to access your account or settings.  We reserve the right to suspend or end the services at any time, with or without cause, and with or without notice.  Even after your use and participation are banned, blocked or otherwise suspended, these Terms of Use will remain in effect with respect to relevant provisions, including Sections 1, 3, 4, 6, 7, 9-15, and 17.\nHighlighted for emphasis\nWe hope that no serious disagreements arise involving you, but, in the event there is a dispute, we encourage you to seek resolution through the dispute resolution procedures or mechanisms provided by the Projects or Project editions and the Wikimedia Foundation. If you seek to file a legal claim against us, you agree to file and resolve it exclusively in a state or federal court located in San Francisco County, California.  You also agree that the laws of the State of California and, to the extent applicable, the laws of the United States of America will govern these Terms of Use, as well as any legal claim that might arise between you and us (without reference to conflict of laws principles).  You agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of, and agree that venue is proper in, the courts located in San Francisco County, California, in any legal action or proceeding relating to us or these Terms of Use.\nTo ensure that disputes are dealt with soon after they arise, you agree that regardless of any statute or law to the contrary, any claim or cause of action you might have arising out of or related to use of our services or these Terms of Use must be filed within the applicable statute of limitations or, if earlier, one (1) year after the pertinent facts underlying such claim or cause of action could have been discovered with reasonable diligence (or be forever barred).\nHighlighted for emphasis\nAt the Wikimedia Foundation, we do our best to provide educational and informational content to a very wide audience, but your use of our services is at your sole risk.  We provide these services on an \"as is\" and \"as available\" basis, and we expressly disclaim all express or implied warranties of all kinds, including but not limited to the implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and non-infringement.  We make no warranty that our services will meet your requirements, be safe, secure, uninterrupted, timely, accurate, or error-free, or that your information will be secure.\nWe are not responsible for the content, data, or actions of third parties, and you release us, our directors, officers, employees, and agents from any claims and damages, known and unknown, arising out of or in any way connected with any claim you have against any such third parties.  No advice or information, whether oral or written, obtained by you from us or through or from our services creates any warranty not expressly stated in these Terms of Use.\nAny material downloaded or otherwise obtained through your use of our services is done at your own discretion and risk, and you will be solely responsible for any damage to your computer system or loss of data that results from the download of any such material.  You agree that we have no responsibility or liability for the deletion of, or the failure to store or to transmit, any content or communication maintained by the service.  We retain the right to create limits on use and storage at our sole discretion at any time with or without notice.\nSome states or jurisdictions do not allow the types of disclaimers in this section, so they may not apply to you either in part or in full depending on the law.\nHighlighted for emphasis\nThe Wikimedia Foundation will not be liable to you or to any other party for any direct, indirect, incidental, special, consequential or exemplary damages, including but not limited to, damages for loss of profits, goodwill, use, data, or other intangible losses, regardless of whether we were advised of the possibility of such damage.  In no event shall our liability exceed one thousand U.S. dollars (USD 1000.00) in aggregate.  In the case that applicable law may not allow the limitation or exclusion of liability or incidental or consequential damages, the above limitation or exclusion may not apply to you, although our liability will be limited to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law.\nJust as the Wikimedia community's input is essential for the growth and maintenance of the Projects, we believe that community input is essential for these Terms of Use to properly serve our users.  It is also essential for a fair contract.  Therefore, we will provide these Terms of Use, as well as any substantial future revisions of these Terms of Use, to the community for comment at least thirty (30) days before the end of the comment period. If a future proposed revision is substantial, we will provide an additional 30 days for comments after posting a translation of the proposed revision in at least three languages (selected at our discretion).  The community will be encouraged to translate the proposed revision in other languages as appropriate.  For changes for legal or administrative reasons, to correct an inaccurate statement, or changes in response to community comments, we will provide at least three (3) days' notice.\nBecause it may be necessary to modify these Terms of Use from time to time, we will provide notice of such modifications and the opportunity to comment via the Project websites, and via a notification on WikimediaAnnounce-L. However, we ask that you please periodically review the most up-to-date version of these Terms of Use.  Your continued use of our services after the new Terms of Use become official following the notice and review period constitutes an acceptance of these Terms of Use on your part.  For the protection of the Wikimedia Foundation and other users like yourself, if you do not agree with our Terms of Use, you cannot use our services.\nThese Terms of Use do not create an employment, agency, partnership, or joint venture relationship between you and us, the Wikimedia Foundation.  If you have not signed a separate agreement with us, these Terms of Use are the entire agreement between you and us.  If there is any conflict between these Terms of Use and a signed written agreement between you and us, the signed agreement will control.\nYou agree that we may provide you with notices, including those regarding changes to the Terms of Use, by email, regular mail, or postings on Project websites.\nIf in any circumstance, we do not apply or enforce any provision of these Terms of Use, it is not a waiver of that provision.\nYou understand that, unless otherwise agreed to in writing by us, you have no expectation of compensation for any activity, contribution, or idea that you provide to us, the community, or the Wikimedia Projects or Project editions.\nNotwithstanding any provision to the contrary in these Terms of Use, we (the Wikimedia Foundation) and you agree not to modify the applicable terms and requirements of any free license that is employed on the Projects or Project editions when such free license is authorized by these Terms of Use.\nThese Terms of Use were written in English (U.S.).  While we hope that translations of these Terms of Use are accurate, in the event of any differences in meaning between the original English version and a translation, the original English version takes precedence.\nIf any provision or part of a provision of these Terms of Use is found unlawful, void, or unenforceable, that provision or part of the provision is deemed severable from these Terms of Use and will be enforced to the maximum extent permissible, and all other provisions of these Terms of Use will remain in full force and effect.\nWe appreciate your taking the time to read these Terms of Use, and we are very happy to have you contributing to the Projects and using our services.  Through your contributions, you are helping to build something really big \u2013 not only an important collection of collaboratively edited reference Projects that provides education and information to millions who might otherwise lack access, but also a vibrant community of like-minded and engaged peers, focused on a very noble goal.\nThese Terms of Use went into effect on June 16, 2014. Previous versions of the terms:\n---Terms of Use (2012\u20132014): effective from May 24, 2012 until June 16, 2014\n---Terms of Use (2009): effective from 2009 until May 24, 2012.\nIn the event of any differences in meaning between the original English version and a translation, the original English version takes precedence.\nCategories: ---Terms of Use---PolicyHidden category: ---Governance wiki\n"}, "wordpress.com": {"http://automattic.com/privacy/": "\nPrivacy\u00a0Policy \u2014  Automattic\n---Home\n---About Us\n---News\n---Work With Us\n---Who We Are and What This Policy Covers---Creative Commons Sharealike License---Information We Collect---Information You Provide to Us---Information We Collect Automatically---Information We Collect from Other Sources---How and Why We Use Information---Purposes for Using Information---Legal Bases for Collecting and Using Information---Sharing Information---How We Share Information---Information Shared Publicly---How Long We Keep Information---Security---Choices---Your Rights---Controllers and Responsible Companies---How to Reach Us---Other Things You Should Know (Keep Reading!)---Transferring Information---Ads and Analytics Services Provided by Others---Third Party Software and Services---Visitors to Our Users\u2019 Websites---Privacy Policy Changes---Change log \nYour privacy is critically important to us. At Automattic, we have a few fundamental principles:\n---We are thoughtful about the personal information we ask you to provide and the personal information that we collect about you through the operation of our services.\n---We store personal information for only as long as we have a reason to keep it.\n---We aim to make it as simple as possible for you to control what information on your website is shared publicly (or kept private), indexed by search engines, and permanently deleted.\n---We help protect you from overreaching government demands for your personal information.\n---We aim for full transparency on how we gather, use, and share your personal information.\nBelow is our Privacy Policy, which incorporates and clarifies these principles.\nHowdy! We are the folks behind a variety of products and services designed to allow anyone \u2014 from bloggers, to photographers, small business owners, and enterprises \u2014 to take full advantage of the power and promise of the open web. Our mission is to democratize publishing and commerce so that anyone with a story can tell it, and anyone can turn their great idea into a livelihood. We believe in powering the open Internet with code that is open source and are proud to say that the vast majority of our work is available under the General Public License (\u201cGPL\u201d). Unlike most other services, because our GPL code is public, you can actually download and take a look at that code to see how it works.\nThis Privacy Policy applies to information that we collect about you when you use:\n---Our websites (including automattic.com, wordpress.com, vip.wordpress.com, jetpack.com, woocommerce.com, crowdsignal.com, gravatar.com, intensedebate.com, vaultpress.com, akismet.com, simplenote.com, simperium.com, leandomainsearch.com, cloudup.com, longreads.com, and happy.tools);\n---Our mobile applications (including the WordPress mobile app for Android and iOS);\n---Our other Automattic products and services that are available on or through our websites (including WordPress.com plans, WordPress.com VIP, Jetpack, the WooCommerce Services Extension, Gravatar, the IntenseDebate comment management system, Akismet plans, Simplenote, Simperium, Cloudup, Longreads, and Happy Tools); and\n---Other users\u2019 websites that use our Services, while you are logged in to your account with us.\nThroughout this Privacy Policy we\u2019ll refer to our websites, mobile applications, and other products and services collectively as \u201cServices.\u201d And if you\u2019d like to learn more about which Automattic company is the controller of information about you, take a look at the section below on Controllers and Responsible Companies.\nPlease note that this Privacy Policy does not apply to any of our products or services that have a separate privacy policy.\nBelow we explain how we collect, use, and share information about you, along with the choices that you have with respect to that information.\nWe\u2019ve decided to make this Privacy Policy available under a Creative Commons Sharealike license. You can grab a copy of this Privacy Policy and other legal documents on Github. You\u2019re more than welcome to copy it, adapt it, and repurpose it for your own use. Just make sure to revise the language so that your policy reflects your actual practices. Also, if you do use the policy we\u2019d appreciate a credit and link to Automattic somewhere on your site.\nWe only collect information about you if we have a reason to do so\u2013for example, to provide our Services, to communicate with you, or to make our Services better.\nWe collect information in three ways: if and when you provide information to us, automatically through operating our Services, and from outside sources. Let\u2019s go over the information that we collect.\nInformation You Provide to Us\nIt\u2019s probably no surprise that we collect information that you provide to us. The amount and type of information depends on the context and how we use the information. Here are some examples:\n---Basic Account Information: We ask for basic information from you in order to set up your account. For example, we require individuals who sign up for a WordPress.com account to provide an email address along with a username or name, depending on the service \u2013 and that\u2019s it. You may provide us with more information \u2013 like your address and other information you want to share \u2013 but we don\u2019t require that information to create a WordPress.com account.\n---Public Profile Information: If you have an account with us, we collect the information that you provide for your public profile. For example, if you have a WordPress.com account, your username is part of that public profile, along with any other information you put into your public profile, such as a photo or an \u201cAbout Me\u201d description. Your public profile information is just that \u2014 public \u2014 so please keep that in mind when deciding what information you would like to include.\n---Transaction and Billing Information: If you buy something from us \u2013a subscription to a WordPress.com plan, a premium theme, a\u00a0custom domain, or some fun Longreads swag, for example \u2013 you will provide additional personal and payment information that is required to process the transaction and your payment, such as your name, credit card information, and contact information.\n---Happy Tools Information: If you are a Happy Tools user, you will provide us with information to make use of the Service\u2019s features. For example, you might enter timezone and location information, company information, and contact information.\n---Ecommerce Site Information: If you use our ecommerce Services to sell products or services to others through your site (including Stores on WordPress.com, the WooCommerce Services extension, or other purchases on WooCommerce.com), you will have to create a WordPress.com account or connect an existing account and, for some of our ecommerce Services, provide your site URL. You may also provide us with information about your financial account to set up a payments integration, such as the email address for your Stripe or PayPal account or your bank account information.\n---Content Information: Depending on the Services you use, you may also provide us with information about you in draft and published content (such as for your website or your Crowdsignal survey). For example, if you write a blog post that includes biographic information about you, we will have that information, and so will anyone with access to the Internet if you choose to publish the post publicly. This might be obvious to you\u2026but it\u2019s not to everyone!\n---Credentials: Depending on the Services you use, you may provide us with credentials for your website (like SSH, FTP, and SFTP username and password). For example, Jetpack and VaultPress users may provide us with these credentials in order to use our one-click restore feature if there is a problem with their site, or to allow us to troubleshoot problems on their site more quickly.\n---Communications with Us (Hi There!): You may also provide us information when you respond to surveys, communicate with our Happiness Engineers about a support question, post a question about your site in our public forums, or sign up for a newsletter like the one we send through Longreads. When you communicate with us via form, email, phone, WordPress.com comment, or otherwise, we store a copy of our communications (including any call recordings as permitted by applicable law).\nInformation We Collect Automatically\nWe also collect some information automatically:\n---Log Information: Like most online service providers, we collect information that web browsers, mobile devices, and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, IP address, unique device identifiers, language preference, referring site, the date and time of access, operating system, and mobile network information. We collect log information when you use our Services\u2013for example, when you create or make changes to your website on WordPress.com.\n---Usage Information: We collect information about your usage of our Services. For example, we collect information about the actions that site administrators and users perform on a site using our WordPress.com or Jetpack services\u2013in other words, who did what, when and to what thing on a site (e.g., [WordPress.com username] deleted \u201c[title of post]\u201d at [time/date]). As another example, our WooCommerce Usage Tracker tracks information like your email address, WooCommerce settings, PHP settings, and other features for your site, along with information about your online store, such as the aggregate number of orders and customers. We also collect information about what happens when you use our Services (e.g., page views, support document searches at en.support.wordpress.com, features enabled for your website, interactions with our Admin Bar and other parts of our Services) along with information about your device (e.g., screen size, name of cellular network, and mobile device manufacturer). We use this information to, for example, provide our Services to you, as well as get insights on how people use our Services, so we can make our Services better.\n---Location Information: We may determine the approximate location of your device from your IP address. We collect and use this information to, for example, calculate how many people visit our Services from certain geographic regions. We may also collect information about your precise location via our mobile apps (when, for example, you post a photograph with location information) if you allow us to do so through your mobile device operating system\u2019s permissions.\n---Stored Information: We may access information stored on your mobile device via our mobile apps. We access this stored information through your device operating system\u2019s permissions. For example, if you give us permission to access the photographs on your mobile device\u2019s camera roll, our Services may access the photos stored on your device when you upload a really amazing photograph of the sunrise to your website.\n---Interactions with Other Users\u2019 Sites: We collect some information about your interactions with other users\u2019 sites while you are logged in to your account with us, such as your \u201cLikes\u201d and the fact that you commented on a particular post, so that we can, for example, recommend posts we think may interest you. As another example, for Intense Debate users, we collect information about the comments you make while logged in to your account, and use that information to, for example, tally up statistics about your comments (check them out in your dashboard!) and provide the information about your comments in your Intense Debate public profile.\n---Information from Cookies & Other Technologies: A cookie is a string of information that a website stores on a visitor\u2019s computer, and that the visitor\u2019s browser provides to the website each time the visitor returns. Pixel tags (also called web beacons) are small blocks of code placed on websites and emails. Automattic uses cookies and other technologies like pixel tags to help us identify and track visitors, usage, and access preferences for our Services, as well as track and understand email campaign effectiveness and to deliver targeted ads. For more information about our use of cookies and other technologies for tracking, including how you can control the use of cookies, please see our Cookie Policy.\nInformation We Collect from Other Sources\nWe may also get information about you from other sources. For example, if you create or log into your WordPress.com account through another service (like Google) or if you connect your website or account to a social media service (like Twitter) through our Publicize feature, we will receive information from that service (such as your username, basic profile information, and friends list) via the authorization procedures used by that service. The information we receive depends on which services you authorize and any options that are available.\nWe may also get information, such as a mailing address, from third party services about individuals who are not yet our users (\u2026but we hope will be!), which we may use, for example, for marketing and advertising purposes like postcards and other mailers advertising our services.\nPurposes for Using Information\nWe use information about you as mentioned above and for the purposes listed below:\n---To provide our Services\u2013for example, to set up and maintain your account, host your website, backup and restore your website, charge you for any of our paid Services,\u00a0or provide essays and stories for your reading pleasure through Longreads;\n---To further develop and improve our Services\u2013for example, by adding new features that we think our users will enjoy or will help them to create and manage their websites more efficiently;\n---To monitor and analyze trends and better understand how users interact with our Services, which helps us improve our Services and make them easier to use;\n---To measure, gauge, and improve the effectiveness of our advertising, and better understand user retention and attrition \u2014 for example, we may analyze how many individuals purchased a paid plan after receiving a marketing message or the features used by those who continue to use our Services after a certain length of time;\n---To monitor and prevent any problems with our Services, protect the security of our Services, detect and prevent fraudulent transactions and other illegal activities, fight spam, and protect the rights and property of Automattic and others, which may result in us declining a transaction or the use of our Services;\n---To communicate with you, for example through an email, about offers and promotions offered by Automattic and others we think will be of interest to you, solicit your feedback, or keep you up to date on Automattic and our products (which you can unsubscribe from at any time); and\n---To personalize your experience using our Services, provide content recommendations (for example, through our Reader Post Suggestions), target our marketing messages to groups of our users (for example, those who have a particular plan with us or have been our user for a certain length of time), and serve relevant advertisements.\nLegal Bases for Collecting and Using Information\nA note here for those in the European Union about our legal grounds for processing information about you under EU data protection laws, which is that our use of your information is based on the grounds that:\n(1) The use is necessary in order to fulfill our commitments to you under the applicable terms of service or other agreements with you or is necessary to administer your account \u2014 for example, in order to enable access to our website on your device or charge you for a paid plan; or\n(2) The use is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation; or\n(3) The use is necessary in order to protect your vital interests or those of another person; or\n(4) We have a legitimate interest in using your information \u2014 for example, to provide and update our Services; to improve our Services so that we can offer you an even better user experience; to safeguard our Services; to communicate with you; to measure, gauge, and improve the effectiveness of our advertising; and to understand our user retention and attrition; to monitor and prevent any problems with our Services; and to personalize your experience; or\n(5) You have given us your consent \u2014 for example before we place certain cookies on your device and access and analyze them later on, as described in our Cookie Policy.\nHow We Share Information\nWe do not sell our users\u2019 private personal information.\nWe share information about you in the limited circumstances spelled out below and with appropriate safeguards on your privacy:\n---Subsidiaries, Employees, and Independent Contractors: We may disclose information about you to our subsidiaries, our employees, and individuals who are our independent contractors that need to know the information in order to help us provide our Services or to process the information on our behalf. We require our subsidiaries, employees, and independent contractors to follow this Privacy Policy for personal information that we share with them.\n---Third Party Vendors: We may share information about you with third party vendors who need to know information about you in order to provide their services to us, or to provide their services to you or your site. This group includes vendors that help us provide our Services to you (like payment providers that process your credit and debit card information, payment providers you use for your ecommerce operations, fraud prevention services that allow us to analyze fraudulent payment transactions, postal and email delivery services that help us stay in touch with you, customer chat and email support services that help us communicate with you, registrars, registries, and data escrow services that allow us to provide domain registration services, and your hosting provider if your site is not hosted by Automattic), those that assist us with our marketing efforts (e.g. by providing tools for identifying a specific marketing target group or improving our marketing campaigns), those that help us understand and enhance our Services (like analytics providers), and companies that make products available on our websites (such as the extensions on WooCommerce.com), who may need information about you in order to, for example, provide technical or other support services to you. We require vendors to agree to privacy commitments in order to share information with them. Other vendors are listed in our more specific policies (e.g. our Cookie Policy).\n---Legal and Regulatory Requirements: We may disclose information about you in response to a subpoena, court order, or other governmental request. For more information on how we respond to requests for information about WordPress.com users, please see our Legal Guidelines. Additionally, if you have a domain registered with WordPress.com, we may share your information to comply with the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers\u2019 (ICANN) regulations, rules, or policies. For example, your information relating to your domain registration may be available in the WHOIS database, or we may be required to share your information with ICANN-approved Dispute Resolution Service Providers. Please see our Domain Registrations and Privacy support document for more details.\n---To Protect Rights, Property, and Others: We may disclose information about you when we believe in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of Automattic, third parties, or the public at large. For example, if we have a good faith belief that there is an imminent danger of death or serious physical injury, we may disclose information related to the emergency without delay.\n---Business Transfers: In connection with any merger, sale of company assets, or acquisition of all or a portion of our business by another company, or in the unlikely event that Automattic goes out of business or enters bankruptcy, user information would likely be one of the assets that is transferred or acquired by a third party. If any of these events were to happen, this Privacy Policy would continue to apply to your information and the party receiving your information may continue to use your information, but only consistent with this Privacy Policy.\n---With Your Consent: We may share and disclose information with your consent or at your direction. For example, we may share your information with third parties with which you authorize us to do so, such as the social media services that you connect to your site through our Publicize feature.\n---Aggregated or De-Identified Information: We may share information that has been aggregated or reasonably de-identified, so that the information could not reasonably be used to identify you. For instance, we may publish aggregate statistics about the use of our Services and we may share a hashed version of your email address to facilitate customized ad campaigns on other platforms.\n---Site Owners: If you have a WordPress.com account and interact with a site, your information may be shared with the administrators of the site. For example, if you leave a comment on a site that uses our Services (like a site created on WordPress.com or a site running Jetpack), your IP address and the email address associated with your WordPress.com account may be shared with the administrator(s) of the site where you left the comment.\n---Published Support Requests: And if you send us a request (for example, via a support email or one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish that request in order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other users.\nInformation Shared Publicly\nInformation that you choose to make public is\u2013you guessed it\u2013disclosed publicly.\nThat means, of course, that information like your public profile, posts, other content that you make public on your website, and your \u201cLikes\u201d and comments on other websites, are all available to others\u2013and we hope you get a lot of views!\nFor example, the photo that you upload to your public profile, or a default image if you haven\u2019t uploaded one, is your Globally Recognized Avatar, or Gravatar \u2014 get it? :). Your Gravatar, along with other public profile information, will display with the comments and \u201cLikes\u201d that you make on other users\u2019 websites while logged in to your WordPress.com account. Your Gravatar + public profile information may also display with your comments, \u201cLikes,\u201d and other interactions on websites that use our Gravatar service, if the email address associated with your account with us is the same as the email address that you use on the other website.\nWe also provide a \u201cFirehose\u201d stream of public data (like posts and comments) from some sites that use our Services to provide that data to Firehose subscribers, who may view and analyze the content (all subject to our Terms of Service), but do not have rights to re-publish it, publicly.\nPublic information may also be indexed by search engines or used by third parties.\nPlease keep all of this in mind when deciding what you would like to share.\nWe generally discard information about you when we no longer need the information for the purposes for which we collect and use it \u2014 which are described in the section above on How and Why We Use Information \u2014 and we are not legally required to continue to keep it.\nFor example, we keep the web server logs that record information about a visitor to one of Automattic\u2019s websites, such as the visitor\u2019s IP address, browser type, and operating system, for approximately 30 days. We retain the logs for this period of time in order to, among other things, analyze traffic to Automattic\u2019s websites and investigate issues if something goes wrong on one of our websites.\nAs another example, when you delete a post, page, or comment from your WordPress.com site, it stays in your Trash folder for thirty days just in case you change your mind and would like restore that content \u2014 because starting again from scratch is no fun, at all. After the thirty days are up, the deleted content may remain on our backups and caches until purged.\nWhile no online service is 100% secure, we work very hard to protect information about you against unauthorized access, use, alteration, or destruction, and take reasonable measures to do so, such as monitoring our Services for potential vulnerabilities and attacks.\nTo enhance the security of your account, we encourage you to enable our advanced security settings, like Two Step Authentication.\nYou have several choices available when it comes to information about you:\n---Limit the Information that You Provide: If you have an account with us, you can choose not to provide the optional account information, profile information, and transaction and billing information. Please keep in mind that if you do not provide this information, certain features of our Services \u2014 for example, paid, premium themes\u2013may not be accessible.\n---Limit Access to Information on Your Mobile Device: Your mobile device operating system should provide you with the ability to discontinue our ability to collect stored information or location information via our mobile apps. If you do so, you may not be able to use certain features (like adding a location to a photograph, for example).\n---Opt-Out of Marketing Communications: You may opt out of receiving promotional communications from us. Just follow the instructions in those communications or let us know. If you opt out of promotional communications, we may still send you other communications, like those about your account and legal notices.\n---Set Your Browser to Reject Cookies: At this time, Automattic does not respond to \u201cdo not track\u201d signals across all of our Services. However, you can usually choose to set your browser to remove or reject browser cookies before using Automattic\u2019s websites, with the drawback that certain features of Automattic\u2019s websites may not function properly without the aid of cookies.\n---Close Your Account: While we\u2019d be very sad to see you go, if you no longer want to use our Services :( :( :( :(, you can close your account (for example, here, for WordPress.com accounts).\u00a0Please keep in mind that we may continue to retain your information after closing your account, as described in How Long We Keep Information above \u2014 for example, when that information is reasonably needed to comply with (or demonstrate our compliance with) legal obligations such as law enforcement requests, or reasonably needed for our legitimate business interests.\nIf you are located in certain countries, including those that fall under the scope of the European General Data Protection Regulation (AKA the \u201cGDPR\u201d), data protection laws give you rights with respect to your personal data, subject to any exemptions provided by the law, including the rights to:\n---Request access to your personal data;\n---Request correction or deletion of your personal data;\n---Object to our use and processing of your personal data;\n---Request that we limit our use and processing of your personal data; and\n---Request portability of your personal data.\nYou can usually access, correct, or delete your personal data using your account settings and tools that we offer, but if you aren\u2019t able to do that, or you would like to contact us about one of the other rights, scroll down to How to Reach Us to, well, find out how to reach us.\nEU individuals also have the right to make a complaint to a government supervisory authority.\nAutomattic\u2019s Services are worldwide. Different Automattic companies are the controller (or co-controller) of personal information, which means that they are the company responsible for processing that information, based on the particular service and the location of the individual using our Services.\nDepending on the Services you use, more than one company may be the controller of your personal data. Generally, the \u201ccontroller\u201d is the Automattic company that entered into the contract with you under the Terms of Service for the the product or service you use. In addition, Automattic Inc., our US-based company, is the controller for some of the processing activities across all of our Services worldwide.\nThe chart below explains the controllers for processing your personal information. We use the term \u201cDesignated Countries\u201d to refer to Australia, Canada, Japan, Mexico, New Zealand, and all countries located in the European continent.\nIf you reside outside of the Designated Countries\u00a0 (for services other than those offered at WooCommerce.com):\nAutomattic Inc.\n60 29th Street #343\nSan Francisco, CA 94110\nIf you reside in the Designated Countries (for services other than those offered at WooCommerce.com):\nAut O\u2019Mattic A8C Ireland Ltd.\nBusiness Centre, No.1 Lower Mayor Street\nInternational Financial Services Centre\nDublin 1, Ireland\nAutomattic Inc. is also the controller for some of the processing activities related to Services provided by Aut O\u2019Mattic A8C Ireland Ltd.\nIf you are using our Services offered at WooCommerce.com:\nBubblestorm Management (Pty) Ltd (WooCommerce.com)\nUnit A206, The Old Biscuit Mill (TOBM)\n373 \u2013 375 Albert Road, Woodstock\nCape Town, South Africa\nAutomattic Inc. is also the controller for some of the processing activities related to Services provided by Bubblestorm Management (Pty) Ltd (WooCommerce.com).\nIf you have a question about this Privacy Policy, or you would like to contact us about any of the rights mentioned in the Your Rights section above, please contact us.\nTransferring Information\nBecause Automattic\u2019s Services are offered worldwide, the information about you that we process when you use the Services in the EU may be used, stored, and/or accessed by individuals operating outside the European Economic Area (EEA) who work for us, other members of our group of companies, or third party data processors. This is required for the purposes listed in the How and Why We Use Information section above. When providing information about you to entities outside the EEA, we will take appropriate measures to ensure that the recipient protects your personal information adequately in accordance with this Privacy Policy as required by applicable law. These measures include:\n---In the case of US based entities, entering into European Commission approved standard contractual arrangements with them, or ensuring they have signed up to the EU-US Privacy Shield; or\n---In the case of entities based in other countries outside the EEA, entering into European Commission approved standard contractual arrangements with them.\nYou can ask us for more information about the steps we take to protect your personal information when transferring it from the EU.\nAds and Analytics Services Provided by Others\nAds appearing on any of our Services may be delivered by advertising networks. Other parties may also provide analytics services via our Services. These ad networks and analytics providers may set tracking technologies (like cookies) to collect information about your use of our Services and across other websites and online services. These technologies allow these third parties to recognize your device to compile information about you or others who use your device. This information allows us and other companies to, among other things, analyze and track usage, determine the popularity of certain content, and deliver advertisements that may be more targeted to your interests. Please note this Privacy Policy only covers the collection of information by Automattic and does not cover the collection of information by any third party advertisers or analytics providers.\nThird Party Software and Services\nIf you\u2019d like to use WooCommerce extensions that enable services provided by third parties, third party plugins, embeds, or other third party software or services, please keep in mind that when you interact with them you may provide information about yourself (or your site visitors) to those third parties. For example, some third party services may request or require access to your (yours, your visitors\u2019, or customers\u2019) data, for example, via a pixel or cookie. Please note that if you use the third party service or grant access, your data will handled in accordance with the third party\u2019s privacy policy and practices. We don\u2019t own or control these third parties, and they have their own rules about collection, use, and sharing of information, which you should review before using the software or services.\nVisitors to Our Users\u2019 Websites\nWe also process information about visitors to our users\u2019 websites, on behalf of our users and in accordance with our user agreements. Please note that our processing of that information on behalf of our users for their websites isn\u2019t covered by this Privacy Policy. We encourage our users to post a privacy policy that accurately describes their practices on data collection, use, and sharing of personal information. If you\u2019d like, you can also read more about the data we collect on behalf of our users in our Privacy Notice.\nAlthough most changes are likely to be minor, Automattic may change its Privacy Policy from time to time. Automattic encourages visitors to frequently check this page for any changes to its Privacy Policy. If we make changes, we will notify you by revising the change log below, and, in some cases, we may provide additional notice (such as adding a statement to our homepage or the WordPress.com Blog, or sending you a notification through email or your dashboard).

By using a Paid Service, you agree to pay the specified fees. Depending on the Paid Service, there may be a one-time fee or recurring fees.

In particular, make sure that none of the prohibited items (like spam, viruses, or serious threats of violence) appear on your website.\nIf you find a WordPress.com website that you believe violates these Terms, please visit our dispute resolution and reporting page.\nYour WordPress.com Website. If you create a website on WordPress.com, you get to use an Automattic-owned subdomain, such as example.wordpress.com or mollys.food.blog. You must not engage in \u201cdomain squatting,\u201d claim an unreasonable number of subdomains (as determined by us), or sell access to any subdomains.\nLicense. By submitting Content to Automattic for inclusion on your website, you grant Automattic a world-wide, royalty-free, and non-exclusive license to reproduce, modify, adapt, and publish the Content solely for the purpose of displaying, distributing, and promoting your website.

By using WordPress.com, you represent and warrant that your Content and conduct do not violate the User Guidelines.\nHTTPS. We offer free HTTPS on all WordPress.com websites by default, including those using custom domains, via Let\u2019s Encrypt.

By activating these features, you grant us permission to display your Jetpack Content on WordPress.com for the purpose of distributing and promoting your website. Some features are on by default and others you need to enable manually. You can see which features are active, and activate and deactivate features, on your dashboard.\nLicense. You agree that we may scan your website, and compile aggregated/anonymized statistics for our internal use to optimize Jetpack\u2019s performance. By submitting Content to Automattic for inclusion on your website, you grant Automattic a world-wide, royalty-free, and non-exclusive license to reproduce, modify, adapt, and publish the Content solely for the purpose of displaying, distributing, and promoting your website. This license also allows Automattic to make any publicly-posted Content available to third parties selected by Automattic (through Firehose, for example) so that these third parties can analyze and distribute (but not publicly display) the Content through their services.\nStorage of Information. Certain Jetpack features rely on WordPress.com servers to function, such as those that allow you to send email, publish links, relate posts to each other, or resize images. To take advantage of the performance boosting features of Jetpack, certain information about the Content, settings, and setup of your website are synced with our servers, as described on our What Data Does Jetpack Sync? support page.\nProhibited Uses. Your website and Jetpack Content must comply with Jetpack\u2019s Service Guidelines.\nVaultPress is a subscription-based security and backup service for self-hosted WordPress websites.\nVaultPress Content. VaultPress will backup your WordPress content (e.g., your WordPress database, plugins, themes, and uploads, as well as some additional files, as described in this introduction to VaultPress) (\u201cVaultPress Content\u201d). You can view the Content that VaultPress backs up via your VaultPress dashboard. You\u2019re fully responsible for your VaultPress Content. It\u2019s your responsibility to ensure that your website\u2019s Content abides by applicable laws and by these Terms. We don\u2019t actively review the VaultPress Content.\nAccess. If you lose access to your WordPress.com account, you may not be able to access your backed up VaultPress Content.\nLicense. By using VaultPress, you grant us access to your website\u2019s servers for the purpose of backing up and securing your VaultPress Content, and restoring files and database information (which may include access details for multiple servers or accounts for each website that we backup). In order to address security vulnerabilities, we may push an upgrade to your website, or we may access your website to remove malicious code.

If you use WooCommerce, the WooCommerce Use Terms also apply.\nUsage of Information. WooCommerce Services may require Automattic\u2019s servers, a connection to our partners, and/or data from your website, to work, as described on our What Data Does Jetpack Sync? support page.\nProhibited Uses. If your store is on WordPress.com, you must not violate our User Guidelines or Store Guidelines.\nThird Party Services. You may choose to set up and/or use third party services, such Stripe or PayPal to collect payment, TaxJar to calculate taxes, or EasyPost to manage shipping. If you do so, be aware that some of your \u2014 and your customers\u2019 \u2014 data may be passed to the respective third party, and the respective third party\u2019s terms of service, privacy policy, and other policies may apply. We are not involved in these relationships. Please note that some of these third party services (like TaxJar) may be enabled by default, but you may disable them before your store is set up. If you do not want to use these third party services, please disable them.\nTax Calculations. Tax calculations are provided by TaxJar. You are responsible for all taxes and fees associated with your ecommerce activities. You must collect, report, and/or pay the correct amounts to the appropriate authorities, if applicable and, if needed, inform your customers about any taxes they may be required to pay and issue appropriate invoices. While some Ecommerce Services allow you to include sales taxes or Value Added Taxes in transactions, you should not rely solely on these features. While our goal is to keep our documents and tools up-to-date, tax laws change rapidly, and we do not guarantee that tax calculations you receive through or in connection with our Services are complete and accurate. Tax laws also differ from jurisdiction to jurisdiction and may be subject to different interpretations by different authorities. We recommend that you consult with a tax professional for your specific tax situation when assessing the correct tax rates you should charge.\nShipping Services. Shipping labels are provided by EasyPost and allow you to take advantage of real-time shipping rates to purchase postage and print shipping labels from certain mailing services, such as USPS and Canada Post. We act only as an intermediary between you and these third parties; we are not involved in any way with your product or its shipment. We also do not warrant that the results you obtain from the use of these services (rates and labels, for example) will be accurate or reliable.\nYou are solely responsible for compliance with all applicable rules and regulations, including domestic and international shipping and customs regulations and those of the relevant mailing service. For example, if you use USPS postage, you will need to comply with their shipping restrictions and mailing standards, among others.\nIn addition, you are solely responsible for customs charges, import taxes or duties, or any other charges related to your shipments. If any charges are assessed against us as a result of your use of the shipping services, you will reimburse us for the full amount within 7 days.\nYou authorize us to charge you for the fees associated with each shipping label you create. Each fee will be charged separately to the payment methods you have provided in your WordPress.com account, which you can view and manage as described the Payment Methods support page. If you have multiple payment methods, you can select which should be used for the shipping label service. If we are unable to collect payment from you for these fees, you will be responsible for payment within 7 days; please contact us to remit payment.\nRefunds for unused shipping labels must be requested in your store\u2019s wp-admin within 30 days of creating the label. Please note that depending on your bank and the third party involved, it may take up to 45 days for your refund to issue. If you haven\u2019t received your refund within this time frame, please contact us.\nYou may not transfer or sell postage and/or shipping labels to a third party.\nYour Responsibilities. You are solely responsible for all of your ecommerce activities, including your store, your items, its operation, all applicable taxes and fees, compliance with the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS), and compliance with any applicable laws. Among other things, this means that:\n---You should use your best judgment when setting up your store, operating your store, processing payments, and selling items. For example, you may not want to accept check payments if you are not comfortable sharing your mailing address with a customer, or you may want to publish payment and return policies.\n---We are not involved in your relationships or transactions with any customer or potential customer.\n---You are responsible for resolving all support questions, comments, and complaints, including refunds, chargebacks, or pricing questions. You should provide contact information so that customers may contact you with questions or complaints.\n---You are responsible for delivering items sold to your customers, and for fulfilling all promises, representations, or warranties you make to them in connection with a sale.\nAs we ask others to respect our intellectual property rights, we respect the intellectual property rights of others.

We do not have control over how a Third Party Service may use your data.

We have the right (though not the obligation) to, in our sole discretion, (i) reclaim your username or website\u2019s URL due to prolonged inactivity, (ii) refuse or remove any content that, in our reasonable opinion, violates any Automattic policy or is in any way harmful or objectionable, or (iii) terminate or deny access to and use of any of our Services to any individual or entity for any reason.

Alle von XING angebotenen Websites, Subdomains, Aliases, mobile Applikationen, Hintergrund-Applikationen, Webservices und Einbindungen in Drittseiten, auf denen XING zur Verf\u00fcgung steht, werden im Folgenden insgesamt die \"XING Websites\" genannt.\nZu den Anwendungen des Dienstes XING geh\u00f6ren insbesondere Kontakt- und Kommunikationsforen (im Folgenden \"soziales Netzwerk\"), f\u00fcr das der Nutzer eine Mitgliedschaft erwerben kann, eine \"Veranstaltungsplattform\" und eine \"Arbeitgeberbewertungsplattform\". Einige der XING Anwendungen treten dabei gegebenenfalls unter anderen Markennamen oder unter Nutzung von anderen XING Websites in Erscheinung.\nDiese Allgemeinen Bedingungen f\u00fcr die Nutzung des Dienstes XING regeln das Vertragsverh\u00e4ltnis zwischen dem Nutzer und XING, unabh\u00e4ngig davon, \u00fcber welche der XING Websites der Nutzer Leistungen von XING in Anspruch nimmt.\nHinsichtlich der Nutzung einzelner Anwendungen gelten erg\u00e4nzend zu diesen Allgemeinen Bedingungen f\u00fcr die Nutzung des Dienstes XING gegebenenfalls zus\u00e4tzliche Bedingungen  (z. B. der Verhaltenskodex f\u00fcr Gruppen-Moderatoren oder die Kommentar-Regeln f\u00fcr XING News). Im Fall eines Widerspruchs geht die Regelung der zus\u00e4tzlichen Bedingungen f\u00fcr die Nutzung der jeweiligen Anwendung diesen Allgemeinen Bedingungen f\u00fcr die Nutzung des Dienstes XING vor, sofern dieser Vorrang nicht in den zus\u00e4tzlichen Bedingungen f\u00fcr die Nutzung der jeweiligen Anwendung ausgeschlossen ist.\nDie Allgemeinen Bedingungen f\u00fcr die Nutzung des Dienstes XING und etwaige zus\u00e4tzliche Bedingungen f\u00fcr die Nutzung einzelner Anwendungen werden im Folgenden insgesamt \"AGB\" genannt.\nDer Vertragsschluss erfolgt mit der XING SE, Dammtorstra\u00dfe 30, 20354 Hamburg. Weitere Kontaktdaten, die Handelsregisterdaten sowie der Name einer vertretungsberechtigten Person der XING SE k\u00f6nnen dem Impressum entnommen werden.\n\u00a0\nAllgemein\n1.1\nXING ist ein Dienst, der den Zweck verfolgt, durch eine Vielfalt unterschiedlicher Anwendungen zur Verbesserung und Vereinfachung des Berufslebens des Nutzers beizutragen.\n1.2\nAngesichts des zunehmenden Verschwimmens der Grenzen zwischen Arbeits- und Privatleben und der Wechselwirkungen zwischen beiden, konzentriert sich XING dabei nicht ausschlie\u00dflich auf den professionellen Kontext, sondern bezieht auch Anwendungen im privaten Kontext mit ein.\n1.3\nInsbesondere m\u00f6chte XING dem Nutzer neue M\u00f6glichkeiten er\u00f6ffnen (vorwiegend im professionellen Kontext, aber auch im privaten Kontext), ihm erleichtern horizontale Netzwerke zu bilden, Informationen demokratisieren, den Informationsaustausch f\u00f6rdern und lebenslanges Lernen unterst\u00fctzen. Um diese Zwecke zu erf\u00fcllen, stellt XING dem Nutzer unter anderem auf Basis erhobener Daten bestimmte Informationen, Angebote, Empfehlungen sowie Dienstleistungen bereit und f\u00f6rdert die Interaktion \u2013 innerhalb und au\u00dferhalb des Netzwerks des Nutzers. Dies erfolgt entsprechend etwaiger Privatsph\u00e4re-Einstellungen und  Einwilligungserkl\u00e4rungen des Nutzers.\n1.4\nDas soziale Netzwerk ist die Kern-Anwendung des Dienstes XING. Die im Rahmen des sozialen Netzwerks vom Nutzer erstellte Profilseite (im Folgenden \"Nutzerprofil\" genannt) stellt die Identit\u00e4t dar, mit der der Nutzer innerhalb des Dienstes XING, auf den XING Websites und in den Anwendungen des Dienstes auftritt und dargestellt wird. Grunds\u00e4tzlich ist f\u00fcr die Nutzung von XING ein im sozialen Netzwerk und au\u00dferhalb sichtbares Nutzerprofil erforderlich. Es sind lediglich einzelne Anwendungen des Dienstes XING nutzbar, bei denen das Nutzerprofil im sozialen Netzwerk nicht sichtbar ist. Ebenso gibt es einzelne Anwendungen des Dienstes XING, bei denen der Nutzer nicht mit seinem Nutzerprofil auftritt und dargestellt wird. Es ist jedoch immer eine Registrierung f\u00fcr den Dienst XING erforderlich.\nSoziales Netzwerk\n1.5\nDas soziale Netzwerk bietet dem Nutzer diverse M\u00f6glichkeiten, sich mit dem eigenen Nutzerprofil und mit seinen Aktivit\u00e4ten auf den XING Websites und au\u00dferhalb zu pr\u00e4sentieren und mit anderen Nutzern und Dritten in Echtzeit zu interagieren. Die volle Wirkung des sozialen Netzwerks kann nur bei Abrufbarkeit des Nutzerprofils auch f\u00fcr Nicht-Nutzer und Auffindbarkeit in Suchmaschinen erreicht werden, weshalb diese externe Abruf- und Auffindbarkeit des Nutzerprofils voreingestellt ist.\n1.6\nEin Nutzer, der sich f\u00fcr das soziale Netzwerk registriert, erwirbt zun\u00e4chst eine unentgeltliche Mitgliedschaft im sozialen Netzwerk (im Folgenden \"unentgeltliche Mitgliedschaft\" genannt).\n1.7\nDer Nutzer hat die M\u00f6glichkeit, seine unentgeltliche Mitgliedschaft auf eine entgeltliche Mitgliedschaft im sozialen Netzwerk umzustellen (die entgeltliche Mitgliedschaft im sozialen Netzwerk wird im Folgenden \"Premium-Mitgliedschaft\" genannt). Die Premium-Mitgliedschaft enth\u00e4lt gegen\u00fcber der unentgeltlichen Mitgliedschaft diverse zus\u00e4tzliche und erweiterte Funktionen. Spezielle entgeltliche Mitgliedschaften f\u00fcr einzelne Zielgruppen (z. B. f\u00fcr \"Coaches\") sind ebenfalls dem Begriff \"Premium-Mitgliedschaft\" zuzuordnen. Die unentgeltliche Mitgliedschaft und die Premium-Mitgliedschaft werden im Folgenden gemeinsam als \"XING Mitgliedschaft\" bezeichnet.\n1.8\nSofern XING dem Nutzer anbietet, eine oder mehrere Zusatzleistungen von Drittanbietern zu seiner XING Mitgliedschaft kostenlos oder kostenpflichtig hinzu zu buchen, so kommen diesbez\u00fcglich gesonderte, von der XING Mitgliedschaft getrennte Vertr\u00e4ge zwischen dem Nutzer und den jeweiligen Drittanbietern zu Stande. Insbesondere haben die \u00c4nderung, Einstellung, sonstige Beendigung oder der Austausch der externen Leistungen oder Leistungsst\u00f6rungen im Verh\u00e4ltnis zwischen Nutzer und Drittanbieter keinen Einfluss auf das Vertragsverh\u00e4ltnis zwischen XING und dem Nutzer hinsichtlich der XING Mitgliedschaft. F\u00fcr Zusatzdienstleistungen von Drittanbietern gelten die Gesch\u00e4ftsbedingungen und Datenschutzerkl\u00e4rungen der jeweiligen Drittanbieter, die selbst Vertrags- und Ansprechpartner der Nutzer sind.\n\u00a0\nAllgemein\n2.1\nSofern der Nutzer eine Anwendung des Dienstes XING nutzt, die auch f\u00fcr Nutzer ohne ein im sozialen Netzwerk sichtbares Nutzerprofil nutzbar ist, wird ein Nutzerkonto f\u00fcr den Nutzer angelegt, falls ein solches noch nicht existiert. Dadurch kommt der Vertrag zur Nutzung von XING zwischen dem Nutzer und XING zu Stande. Bei dem Nutzerkonto handelt es sich um ein Nutzerprofil, das zun\u00e4chst nicht im sozialen Netzwerk sichtbar ist. Der Nutzer kann unter seinem Nutzerkonto zun\u00e4chst nur diejenigen Anwendungen des Dienstes XING nutzen, die auch ohne ein im sozialen Netzwerk sichtbares Nutzerprofil nutzbar sind. Wenn der Nutzer Anwendungen des Dienstes XING nutzen m\u00f6chte, f\u00fcr die ein im sozialen Netzwerk sichtbares Nutzerprofil erforderlich ist, muss er die Sichtbarkeit seines Nutzerprofils im sozialen Netzwerk zun\u00e4chst best\u00e4tigen bzw. freigeben.\n2.2\nDie M\u00f6glichkeit zur Nutzung der auf den XING Websites angebotenen Anwendungen stellt kein Angebot, sondern nur eine Aufforderung zur Abgabe eines Angebots dar. Durch den Abschluss des Buchungsvorgangs gibt der Nutzer ein Angebot zum Abschluss des Vertrages \u00fcber die Nutzung der entsprechenden XING Anwendung ab. XING nimmt dieses Angebot des Nutzers durch Bereitstellung der entsprechenden Dienste an. Erst durch diese Annahme kommt der Vertrag zwischen dem Nutzer und XING zustande. XING ist nicht zum Vertragsschluss verpflichtet. Bei Inanspruchnahme von entgeltlichen Leistungen akzeptiert der Nutzer die damit verbundene Zahlungsverpflichtung durch Klicken auf das in diesem Fall angebotene Best\u00e4tigungsfeld.\n2.3\nDer Nutzer sichert zu, dass alle von ihm angegebenen Daten wahr und vollst\u00e4ndig sind. Der Nutzer ist verpflichtet, die Daten hinsichtlich aller von ihm genutzten Anwendungen w\u00e4hrend der gesamten Vertragslaufzeit wahr und vollst\u00e4ndig zu halten. F\u00fcr den Fall, dass der Kundenservice von XING im Auftrag des Nutzers manuelle \u00c4nderungen an den Daten des Nutzers vornimmt, beh\u00e4lt sich XING vor, die daraus f\u00fcr XING gegebenenfalls entstehenden Kosten dem Nutzer in Rechnung zu stellen, in dem Umfang wie der Nutzer das Kosten ausl\u00f6sende Ereignis zu vertreten hat.\n2.4\nDer Nutzer sichert zu, dass er vollj\u00e4hrig ist. F\u00fcr den Fall, dass der Nutzer in Rahmen bestimmter Anwendungen f\u00fcr eine juristische Person t\u00e4tig wird, sichert der Nutzer zu, bevollm\u00e4chtigt zu sein, um im Namen der juristischen Person t\u00e4tig zu werden. Der Nutzer wird XING auf Anfrage die gem\u00e4\u00df dieser Ziffer zugesicherten Angaben nachweisen.\n2.5\nXING kann technisch nicht mit Sicherheit feststellen, ob ein auf den XING Websites registrierter Nutzer tats\u00e4chlich diejenige Person darstellt, die der Nutzer vorgibt zu sein. XING leistet daher keine Gew\u00e4hr f\u00fcr die tats\u00e4chliche Identit\u00e4t eines Nutzers.\nSoziales Netzwerk\n2.6\nF\u00fcr den Erwerb einer XING Mitgliedschaft ist eine Registrierung erforderlich, bei der der Nutzer unter anderem ein Passwort w\u00e4hlen muss.\n2.7\nDer Nutzer ist verpflichtet, das von ihm gew\u00e4hlte Passwort geheim zu halten. XING wird das Passwort nicht an Dritte weitergeben, nur f\u00fcr den Anmeldevorgang benutzen und den Nutzer \u2013 vom Anmeldevorgang abgesehen \u2013 zu keinem Zeitpunkt nach dem Passwort fragen. Aus Sicherheitsgr\u00fcnden und um Missbrauch vorzubeugen wird dem Nutzer empfohlen, sein Passwort in regelm\u00e4\u00dfigen Abst\u00e4nden zu \u00e4ndern. Die Sicherung und Aufbewahrung der Zugangsdaten zum XING Mitgliedskonto (insbesondere des Passworts) f\u00e4llt in den ausschlie\u00dflichen Verantwortungsbereich des Nutzers.\n2.8\nJeder Nutzer darf nur ein Nutzerprofil anlegen. Der Nutzer darf Dritten nicht gestatten, das eigene Nutzerprofil zu nutzen.\n\u00a0\nWiderrufsbelehrung und Muster Widerrufsformular\nWiderrufsrecht\nSie haben das Recht, binnen vierzehn Tagen ohne Angabe von Gr\u00fcnden diesen Vertrag zu widerrufen.\nDie Widerrufsfrist betr\u00e4gt vierzehn Tage ab dem Tag des Vertragsabschlusses.\nUm Ihr Widerrufsrecht auszu\u00fcben, m\u00fcssen Sie uns\nXING SE\nDammtorstra\u00dfe 30\n20354 Hamburg\nTel.: +49 40 419 131-0\nFax: +49 40 419 131-11\nE-Mail: widerruf@xing.com\n mittels einer eindeutigen Erkl\u00e4rung (z. B. ein mit der Post versandter Brief, Telefax, E-Mail oder \u00fcber unser von jeder Seite aus erreichbare Kontaktformular) \u00fcber Ihren Entschluss, diesen Vertrag zu widerrufen, informieren. Sie k\u00f6nnen daf\u00fcr das beigef\u00fcgte Muster-Widerrufsformular verwenden, das jedoch nicht vorgeschrieben ist.\nZur Wahrung der Widerrufsfrist reicht es aus, dass Sie die Mitteilung \u00fcber die Aus\u00fcbung des Widerrufsrechts vor Ablauf der Widerrufsfrist absenden.\nFolgen des Widerrufs\nWenn Sie diesen Vertrag widerrufen, haben wir Ihnen alle Zahlungen, die wir von Ihnen erhalten haben, einschlie\u00dflich der Lieferkosten (mit Ausnahme der zus\u00e4tzlichen Kosten, die sich daraus ergeben, dass Sie eine andere Art der Lieferung als die von uns angebotene, g\u00fcnstige Standardlieferung gew\u00e4hlt haben), unverz\u00fcglich und sp\u00e4testens binnen vierzehn Tagen ab dem Tag zur\u00fcckzahlen, an dem die Mitteilung \u00fcber Ihren Widerruf dieses Vertrags bei uns eingegangen ist. F\u00fcr diese R\u00fcckzahlung verwenden wir dasselbe Zahlungsmittel, das Sie bei der urspr\u00fcnglichen Transaktion eingesetzt haben, es sei denn, mit ihnen wurde ausdr\u00fccklich etwas anderes vereinbart; in keinem Fall werden Ihnen wegen dieser R\u00fcckzahlung Entgelte berechnet.\nHaben Sie verlangt, dass die Dienstleistung w\u00e4hrend der Widerrufsfrist beginnen soll, so haben Sie uns einen angemessenen Betrag zu zahlen, der dem Anteil der bis zu dem Zeitpunkt, zu dem Sie uns von der Aus\u00fcbung des Widerrufsrechts hinsichtlich dieses Vertrags unterrichten, bereits erbrachte Dienstleistungen im Vergleich zum Gesamtumfang der im Vertrag vorgesehenen Dienstleistungen entspricht.\nEin Muster Widerrufsformular liegt hier  f\u00fcr Sie zum Download als PDF-Datei bereit.\nAusschluss des Widerrufsrechts:\nDas Widerrufsrecht besteht nicht, sofern Sie bei Abschluss des Rechtsgesch\u00e4fts in \u00fcberwiegender Aus\u00fcbung ihrer gewerblichen oder selbst\u00e4ndigen beruflichen T\u00e4tigkeit handeln und Sie deshalb als Unternehmer anzusehen sind (\u00a7 14 BGB).\nDas Widerrufsrecht gegen\u00fcber XING gilt nicht hinsichtlich solcher Vertr\u00e4ge, die nicht zwischen Ihnen und XING, sondern zwischen Ihnen und einem Dritten zu Stande kommen. Etwaige Widerrufsrechte k\u00f6nnen diesbez\u00fcglich nur gegen\u00fcber dem Dritten geltend gemacht werden.\nWeitere wichtige Hinweise:\nSie stimmen ausdr\u00fccklich zu, dass wir vor Ende der Widerrufsfrist mit der Ausf\u00fchrung der Dienstleistung beginnen.\n\u00a0\n4.1\nDer Nutzer ist verpflichtet,\n(a) ausschlie\u00dflich wahre und nicht irref\u00fchrende Angaben zu machen sowie seinen Klarnamen und keine Pseudonyme oder K\u00fcnstlernamen zu verwenden;\n(b) als Profilbild im Nutzerprofil im Rahmen des sozialen Netzwerks nur ein solches Foto zu verwenden, auf dem der Nutzer klar und deutlich erkennbar ist. Der Nutzer stellt sicher, dass die \u00f6ffentliche Wiedergabe des von ihm \u00fcbermittelten Profil-Fotos auf den XING Websites nach geltendem Recht erlaubt ist. Die Nutzung von Fotos oder Abbildungen anderer oder nicht existierender Personen oder anderer Wesen (Tiere, Fantasiewesen etc.) oder von Logos als Profilbild ist nicht gestattet.\n(c) bei der Nutzung von XING und der Inhalte auf den XING Websites geltendes Recht sowie alle Rechte Dritter zu beachten. Es ist dem Nutzer insbesondere Folgendes untersagt:\n---\nVerwendung beleidigender oder verleumderischer Inhalte, unabh\u00e4ngig davon, ob diese Inhalte andere Nutzer, XING Mitarbeiter oder andere Personen oder Unternehmen betreffen;\n---\nVerwendung pornografischer, gewaltverherrlichender, missbr\u00e4uchlicher, sittenwidriger oder Jugendschutzgesetze verletzende Inhalte oder Bewerbung, Angebot und/oder Vertrieb von pornografischen, gewaltverherrlichenden, missbr\u00e4uchlichen, sittenwidrigen oder Jugendschutzgesetze verletzende Waren oder Dienstleistungen;\n---\nunzumutbare Bel\u00e4stigungen anderer Nutzer, insbesondere durch Spam (vgl. \u00a7 7 Gesetz gegen den unlauteren Wettbewerb \u2013 UWG);\n---\nVerwendung von gesetzlich (z. B. durch das Urheber-, Marken-, Patent-, Geschmacksmuster- oder Gebrauchsmusterrecht) gesch\u00fctzten Inhalten, ohne dazu berechtigt zu sein, oder Bewerbung, Angebot und/oder Vertrieb von gesetzlich gesch\u00fctzten Waren oder Dienstleistungen, ebenfalls ohne dazu berechtigt zu sein; oder\n---\nVornahme oder F\u00f6rderung wettbewerbswidriger Handlungen, einschlie\u00dflich progressiver Kundenwerbung (wie Ketten-, Schneeball- oder Pyramidensysteme);\n(d) die folgenden bel\u00e4stigenden Handlungen zu unterlassen, auch wenn diese konkret keine Gesetze verletzen sollten:\n---\nVersendung von Kettenbriefen;\n---\nDurchf\u00fchrung, Bewerbung und F\u00f6rderung von Strukturvertriebsma\u00dfnahmen (wie Multi-Level-Marketing oder Multi-Level-Network-Marketing); sowie\n---\nVornahme von anz\u00fcglicher oder sexuell gepr\u00e4gter Kommunikation (explizit oder implizit).\n4.2\nFolgende Handlungen sind dem Nutzer untersagt:\n(a) Verwendung von Mechanismen, Software oder Scripts in Verbindung mit der Nutzung der XING Websites. Die direkte oder indirekte Bewerbung oder Verbreitung solcher Mechanismen, Software oder Scripts ist ebenfalls untersagt. Der Nutzer darf jedoch von XING autorisierte Schnittstellen oder Software nutzen, bewerben oder verbreiten;\n(b) Blockieren, \u00dcberschreiben, Modifizieren, Kopieren, soweit dies nicht f\u00fcr die ordnungsgem\u00e4\u00dfe Nutzung von XING erforderlich ist;\n(c) Verbreitung und \u00f6ffentliche Wiedergabe von Inhalten der XING Websites oder von anderen Nutzern, au\u00dfer diese Verbreitung und \u00f6ffentliche Wiedergabe ist im Rahmen der jeweiligen XING Anwendung vorgesehen oder der andere Nutzer hat der Verbreitung und \u00f6ffentlichen Wiedergabe zugestimmt; und/oder\n(d) jede Handlung, die geeignet ist, die Funktionalit\u00e4t der XING Infrastruktur zu beeintr\u00e4chtigen, insbesondere diese \u00fcberm\u00e4\u00dfig zu belasten.\n4.3\nXING ist nicht verpflichtet, vom Nutzer bereitgestellte Daten und/oder Informationen anderen Nutzern zur Verf\u00fcgung zu stellen, wenn diese Daten und/oder Informationen nicht im Einklang mit den Ziffern 4.1 und 4.2 stehen. XING ist berechtigt, nach den Ziffern 4.1 und 4.2 unzul\u00e4ssige Daten und/oder Informationen ohne Vorank\u00fcndigung gegen\u00fcber dem Nutzer von den XING Websites zu entfernen.\n\u00a0\n\u00c4nderungen der Leistungen\n5.1\nXING beh\u00e4lt sich vor, die auf den XING Websites angebotenen Leistungen zu \u00e4ndern oder abweichende Leistungen anzubieten, au\u00dfer dies ist f\u00fcr den Nutzer nicht zumutbar.\n5.2\nXING beh\u00e4lt sich dar\u00fcber hinaus vor, die auf den XING Websites angebotenen Leistungen zu \u00e4ndern oder abweichende Leistungen anzubieten,\n(a) soweit XING verpflichtet ist, die \u00dcbereinstimmung der von XING angebotenen Leistungen mit dem auf die Leistungen anwendbaren Recht herzustellen, insbesondere wenn sich die geltende Rechtslage \u00e4ndert;\n(b) soweit XING damit einem gegen XING gerichteten Gerichtsurteil oder einer Beh\u00f6rdenentscheidung nachkommt;\n(c) soweit die jeweilige \u00c4nderung notwendig ist, um bestehende Sicherheitsl\u00fccken zu schlie\u00dfen;\n(d) wenn die \u00c4nderung lediglich vorteilhaft f\u00fcr den Nutzer ist; oder\n(e) wenn die \u00c4nderung rein technischer oder prozessualer Natur ohne wesentliche Auswirkungen f\u00fcr den Nutzer ist.\n5.3\n\u00c4nderungen mit lediglich unwesentlichem Einfluss auf die Funktionen von XING stellen keine Leistungs\u00e4nderungen im Sinne dieser Ziffer dar. Dies gilt insbesondere f\u00fcr \u00c4nderungen rein graphischer Art und die blo\u00dfe \u00c4nderung der Anordnung von Funktionen.\n\u00c4nderungen der AGB\n5.4\nXING beh\u00e4lt sich vor, diese AGB jederzeit ohne Nennung von Gr\u00fcnden zu \u00e4ndern, es sei denn, das ist f\u00fcr den Nutzer nicht zumutbar. XING wird den Nutzer \u00fcber \u00c4nderungen der AGB rechtzeitig benachrichtigen. Widerspricht der Nutzer der Geltung der neuen AGB nicht innerhalb von sechs (6) Wochen nach der Benachrichtigung, gelten die ge\u00e4nderten AGB als vom Nutzer angenommen. XING wird den Nutzer in der Benachrichtigung auf sein Widerspruchsrecht und die Bedeutung der Widerspruchsfrist hinweisen.\n5.5\nXING beh\u00e4lt sich dar\u00fcber hinaus vor, AGB zu \u00e4ndern,\n(a) wenn die \u00c4nderung lediglich vorteilhaft f\u00fcr den Nutzer ist;\n(b) wenn die \u00c4nderung rein technisch oder prozessual bedingt ist, es sei denn, sie haben wesentliche Auswirkungen f\u00fcr den Nutzer;\n(c) soweit XING verpflichtet ist, die \u00dcbereinstimmung der AGB mit anwendbarem Recht herzustellen, insbesondere wenn sich die geltende Rechtslage \u00e4ndert;\n(d) soweit XING damit einem gegen XING gerichteten Gerichtsurteil oder einer Beh\u00f6rdenentscheidung  nachkommt; oder\n(e) soweit XING zus\u00e4tzliche, g\u00e4nzlich neue Dienstleistungen, Dienste oder Dienstelemente einf\u00fchrt, die einer Leistungsbeschreibung in den AGB bed\u00fcrfen, es sei denn, dass bisherige Nutzungsverh\u00e4ltnis wird dadurch nachteilig ver\u00e4ndert.\nXING wird \u00fcber solche \u00c4nderungen der AGB informieren, zum Beispiel auf den XING Websites.\n5.6\nIn Bezug auf Produkte, die einzeln gebucht werden und nicht im Rahmen eines Dauerschuldverh\u00e4ltnisses angeboten werden (z. B. die Buchung von Werbung oder das Einstellen einer Veranstaltung) kommt je Buchung ein gesonderter Vertrag zustande, dessen zus\u00e4tzliche Bedingungen gegebenenfalls vor Buchung im Einzelfall gesondert angezeigt werden. Die entsprechenden Vertragsbedingungen und Leistungen k\u00f6nnen unabh\u00e4ngig von den hier genannten Anforderungen an Leistungs\u00e4nderungen f\u00fcr zuk\u00fcnftige Buchungen ge\u00e4ndert werden.\n5.7\nDas K\u00fcndigungsrecht des Nutzers nach Ziff. 7 bleibt von etwaigen \u00c4nderungen der Leistungen oder AGB nach dieser Vorschrift unber\u00fchrt.\n\u00a0\nAllgemein\n6.1\nDer Nutzer kann Rechnungen mittels der von XING angebotenen Zahlungsverfahren begleichen. Kann ein Entgelt nicht eingezogen werden, tr\u00e4gt der Nutzer alle XING daraus entstehenden Kosten, insbesondere Bankgeb\u00fchren im Zusammenhang mit der R\u00fcckgabe von Lastschriften und vergleichbare Geb\u00fchren, in dem Umfang, wie er das Kosten ausl\u00f6sende Ereignis zu vertreten hat.\n6.2\nEs steht XING frei, Rechnungen und Zahlungserinnerungen ausschlie\u00dflich auf elektronischem Weg zu \u00fcbermitteln.\n6.3\nXING beh\u00e4lt sich vor, die Abrechnung jederzeit von Euro auf die jeweilige Landesw\u00e4hrung des Nutzers umzustellen, sofern der Nutzer dem nicht widerspricht.\nPremium-Mitgliedschaft\n6.4\nDie Entgelte f\u00fcr die Premium-Mitgliedschaft sind mit Rechnungsstellung f\u00fcr die gesamte Laufzeit sofort zur Zahlung f\u00e4llig.\n6.5\nXING beh\u00e4lt sich vor, das Entgelt f\u00fcr die Premium-Mitgliedschaft mit Wirkung zum Beginn eines neuen Verl\u00e4ngerungszeitraums, der entweder auf den Mindestnutzungszeitraum oder auf den jeweils laufenden Verl\u00e4ngerungszeitraum folgt, angemessen zu erh\u00f6hen. Pro Kalenderjahr findet maximal eine Preiserh\u00f6hung statt. In diesem Fall wird XING den Nutzer mindestens sechs (6) Wochen vor Ende des Mindestnutzungszeitraums bzw. des jeweils laufenden Verl\u00e4ngerungszeitraums entsprechend informieren. Sofern der Nutzer mit dieser Entgelterh\u00f6hung nicht einverstanden ist, kann er dieser binnen drei (3) Wochen per Kontaktformular, Brief, Fax oder E-Mail widersprechen. Der Widerspruch entspricht einer K\u00fcndigung der Premium-Mitgliedschaft durch den Nutzer, so dass die Premium-Mitgliedschaft mit Ablauf des bestehenden Mindestnutzungszeitraums bzw. des laufenden Verl\u00e4ngerungszeitraums endet.\nHinweis: F\u00fcr Bestandskunden, die sich bereits vor dem 17. M\u00e4rz 2014 bei XING registriert haben, gilt diese Preisanpassungsklausel (Ziffer 6.5) grunds\u00e4tzlich nur, wenn\n(a) sie im Rahmen ihrer Registrierung bei XING bereits einer alten Version der AGB, die eine entsprechende Preisanpassungsklausel enth\u00e4lt (dort in Ziffer 12.2), ausdr\u00fccklich zugestimmt haben; oder\n(b) sie einer entsprechenden Preisanpassungsklausel vor dem 17. M\u00e4rz 2014 gesondert zugestimmt haben (z. B. beim Wechsel vom alten Premium-Produkt auf das aktualisierte Premium-Produkt); oder\n(c) sie einer entsprechenden Preisanpassungsklausel nach dem 17. M\u00e4rz 2014 gesondert zustimmen; oder\n(d) sie diesen AGB inklusive der Preisanpassungsklausel (Ziffer 6.5) ab dem 17. M\u00e4rz 2014 ausdr\u00fccklich zustimmen (z. B. beim Abschluss einer Premium-Mitgliedschaft). \nF\u00fcr Neukunden ab dem 17. M\u00e4rz 2014 gilt die Preisanpassungsklausel (Ziffer 6.5) uneingeschr\u00e4nkt.\nBesonderheit beim Zahlungsverfahren Kreditkarte\n6.6 Bei Neukunden mit gew\u00e4hlter Zahlart Kreditkarte wird XING mit der Testbuchung eines Kleinstbetrags die Kreditkarte des Nutzers \u00fcberpr\u00fcfen und f\u00fcr die sp\u00e4tere Abbuchung des Rechnungsbetrags nach Rechnungsstellung verifizieren. Die Testbuchung wird kurzfristig, in der Regel innerhalb von 24 Stunden, wieder freigegeben.\n\u00a0\nAllgemein\n7.1\nWenn im Einzelfall keine besonderen Bestimmungen zur Laufzeit und K\u00fcndigung einzelner Anwendungen oder XING Mitgliedschaften entgegenstehen, kann das Vertragsverh\u00e4ltnis von beiden Seiten jederzeit beendet werden.\nUnentgeltliche Mitgliedschaft\n7.2\nDer Nutzer und XING k\u00f6nnen die unentgeltliche Mitgliedschaft jederzeit ohne Angabe von Gr\u00fcnden k\u00fcndigen. Zum Schutz des Nutzers gegen unbefugte L\u00f6schung seines Nutzerprofils durch Dritte kann XING bei der  K\u00fcndigung eine Identit\u00e4tsfeststellung durchf\u00fchren, z. B. durch Abfrage des Benutzernamens und einer auf den XING Websites registrierten E-Mail-Adresse.\nPremium-Mitgliedschaft\n7.3\nDie Premium-Mitgliedschaft l\u00e4uft zun\u00e4chst \u00fcber den vom Nutzer gebuchten Mindestnutzungszeitraum. Danach verl\u00e4ngert sich die Premium-Mitgliedschaft jeweils um Verl\u00e4ngerungszeitr\u00e4ume der gleichen Dauer, wenn sie nicht fristgem\u00e4\u00df vom Nutzer oder XING gek\u00fcndigt wird. Der Nutzer und XING k\u00f6nnen die Premium-Mitgliedschaft ohne Angabe von Gr\u00fcnden mit einer Frist von drei (3) Wochen zum Ablauf des im Registrierungsprozess gebuchten Mindestnutzungszeitraums oder anschlie\u00dfend zum Ablauf eines Verl\u00e4ngerungszeitraums per Kontaktformular, Brief, Fax oder E-Mail k\u00fcndigen. Nach der K\u00fcndigung der Premium-Mitgliedschaft durch den Nutzer oder XING bleibt dem Nutzer die unentgeltliche Mitgliedschaft bis zu ihrer Beendigung erhalten, die zus\u00e4tzlichen und erweiterten Funktionen der Premium-Mitgliedschaft fallen jedoch weg.\nK\u00fcndigung und Sperrung aus wichtigem Grund\n7.4\nAuch bei Vorliegen besonderer Bestimmungen zur Laufzeit und K\u00fcndigung haben beide Parteien das Recht, das Vertragsverh\u00e4ltnis bei Vorliegen eines wichtigen Grundes jederzeit ohne Einhaltung einer Frist au\u00dferordentlich zu k\u00fcndigen. Ein wichtiger Grund zur au\u00dferordentlichen K\u00fcndigung liegt vor, wenn die Fortsetzung des Vertragsverh\u00e4ltnisses bis zum Ablauf der gesetzlichen K\u00fcndigungsfrist f\u00fcr die k\u00fcndigende Partei unter Ber\u00fccksichtigung aller Umst\u00e4nde des Einzelfalls und unter Abw\u00e4gung der Interessen beider Parteien nicht zumutbar ist. Wichtige Gr\u00fcnde sind f\u00fcr XING insbesondere die folgenden Ereignisse:\n(a) Nichteinhaltung gesetzlicher Vorschriften durch den Nutzer;\n(b) Versto\u00df des Nutzers gegen seine vertraglichen Pflichten;\n(c) der Ruf der auf den XING Websites angebotenen Dienste wird durch die Pr\u00e4senz des Nutzers erheblich beeintr\u00e4chtigt (z. B., wenn sich nach Registrierung des Nutzers herausstellt, dass der Nutzer wegen einer vors\u00e4tzlichen Straftat rechtskr\u00e4ftig verurteilt ist und anderen Nutzern diese Verurteilung bekannt ist);\n(d) der Nutzer wirbt f\u00fcr Vereinigungen oder Gemeinschaften \u2013 oder deren Methoden oder Aktivit\u00e4ten \u2013, die von Sicherheits- oder Jugendschutzbeh\u00f6rden beobachtet werden;\n(e) der Nutzer sch\u00e4digt einen oder mehrere andere Nutzer; oder\n(f) der Nutzer ist Mitglied einer Sekte oder einer in Deutschland umstrittenen Glaubensgemeinschaft.\n7.5\nBei Vorliegen eines wichtigen Grundes nach Ziffer 7.4 kann XING unabh\u00e4ngig von einer K\u00fcndigung nach Ziffer 7.4 auch die folgenden Sanktionen gegen den Nutzer verh\u00e4ngen:\n(a) L\u00f6schung von Inhalten, die der Nutzer eingestellt hat;\n(b) Sperrung des Zugangs zum Dienst der XING Websites oder einzelner Anwendungen; oder\n(c) Ausspruch einer Abmahnung.\n7.6\nDer Anspruch des Nutzers auf R\u00fcckzahlung bereits im Voraus bezahlter Entgelte bei K\u00fcndigung ist ausgeschlossen, es sei denn, der Nutzer k\u00fcndigt aufgrund eines wichtigen Grundes, der von XING zu vertreten ist. In folgenden F\u00e4llen ist der Anspruch des Nutzers auf R\u00fcckzahlung bereits im Voraus bezahlter Entgelte auf jeden Fall ausgeschlossen:\n(a) XING k\u00fcndigt den Vertrag aus wichtigem Grund; oder\n(b) XING sperrt den Zugang des Nutzers gem\u00e4\u00df Ziffer 7.5.\n\u00a0\n8.1\nXING \u00fcbernimmt keine Verantwortung f\u00fcr die von den Nutzern der XING Websites bereitgestellten Inhalte, Daten und/oder Informationen sowie f\u00fcr Inhalte auf verlinkten externen Websites. XING gew\u00e4hrleistet insbesondere nicht, dass diese Inhalte wahr sind, einen bestimmten Zweck erf\u00fcllen oder einem solchen Zweck dienen k\u00f6nnen.\n8.2\nSoweit der Nutzer eine gesetzes- oder vertragswidrige Benutzung der XING Websites (einschlie\u00dflich der Verwendung von Pseudonymen oder t\u00e4uschenden Identit\u00e4ten) bemerkt, kann er diese melden.\n8.3\nHinsichtlich Daten oder Inhalten, die gem\u00e4\u00df den AGB, den Datenschutzbestimmungen von XING oder den Einstellungen des Nutzers \u00f6ffentlich verf\u00fcgbar sind oder waren und durch einen Dritten gespeichert wurden, trifft XING keine Pflicht zur Unterbindung einer solchen Speicherung beim Dritten.\n8.4\nXING bietet dem Nutzer lediglich eine Plattform an und beteiligt sich grunds\u00e4tzlich nicht inhaltlich an der Kommunikation der Nutzer untereinander. Dies gilt nicht, soweit XING im Einzelfall die Moderation einer Gruppe selbst durchf\u00fchrt. Sofern die Nutzer \u00fcber die XING Websites Vertr\u00e4ge untereinander schlie\u00dfen, ist XING hieran nicht beteiligt und wird daher kein Vertragspartner. Die Nutzer sind f\u00fcr die Abwicklung und die Erf\u00fcllung der untereinander geschlossenen Vertr\u00e4ge allein verantwortlich. XING haftet nicht f\u00fcr Pflichtverletzungen der Nutzer aus den zwischen den Nutzern geschlossenen Vertr\u00e4gen.\n8.5\nDer Nutzer erkennt an, dass eine 100%ige Verf\u00fcgbarkeit der XING Websites technisch nicht zu realisieren ist. XING bem\u00fcht sich jedoch, die XING Websites m\u00f6glichst konstant verf\u00fcgbar zu halten. Insbesondere Wartungs-, Sicherheits- oder Kapazit\u00e4tsbelange sowie Ereignisse, die nicht im Machtbereich von XING stehen (wie z. B. St\u00f6rungen von \u00f6ffentlichen Kommunikationsnetzen, Stromausf\u00e4lle etc.), k\u00f6nnen zu St\u00f6rungen oder zur vor\u00fcbergehenden Einstellung des Dienstes auf den XING Websites f\u00fchren.\n\u00a0\n9.1\nXING haftet unbeschr\u00e4nkt f\u00fcr Sch\u00e4den aus der Verletzung des Lebens, des K\u00f6rpers oder der Gesundheit, die auf einer Pflichtverletzung von XING, eines gesetzlichen Vertreters oder Erf\u00fcllungsgehilfen von XING beruhen sowie f\u00fcr Sch\u00e4den, die durch Fehlen einer von XING garantierten Beschaffenheit hervorgerufen wurden oder bei arglistigem Verhalten von XING. Des Weiteren haftet XING unbeschr\u00e4nkt f\u00fcr Sch\u00e4den, die durch XING oder einem ihrer gesetzlichen Vertreter oder Erf\u00fcllungsgehilfen vors\u00e4tzlich oder durch grobe Fahrl\u00e4ssigkeit verursacht wurden.\n9.2\nBei der leicht fahrl\u00e4ssig verursachten Verletzung wesentlicher Vertragspflichten haftet XING au\u00dfer in den F\u00e4llen der Ziffer 9.1 oder 9.3 der H\u00f6he nach begrenzt auf den vertragstypisch vorhersehbaren Schaden. Wesentliche Vertragspflichten sind abstrakt solche Pflichten, deren Erf\u00fcllung die ordnungsgem\u00e4\u00dfe Durchf\u00fchrung eines Vertrages \u00fcberhaupt erst erm\u00f6glicht und auf deren Einhaltung die Vertragsparteien regelm\u00e4\u00dfig vertrauen d\u00fcrfen. Im \u00dcbrigen ist eine Haftung von XING ausgeschlossen.\n9.3\nDie Haftung nach dem Produkthaftungsgesetz bleibt unber\u00fchrt.\n\u00a0\n10.1\nEine Erhebung, Verarbeitung und/oder Nutzung personenbezogener Daten findet nur statt, wenn der Nutzer eingewilligt hat oder dies durch Gesetz erlaubt ist. Eine Verwendung von personenbezogenen Daten aufgrund einer gesetzlichen Erlaubnis erfolgt insbesondere im Zusammenhang mit der Erf\u00fcllung vertraglicher Pflichten von XING gegen\u00fcber den Nutzern. XING bietet dem Nutzer eine Vielzahl von Funktionen an, die individuell auf diesen angepasst werden (z.

Kauf der Tickets kommt ausschlie\u00dflich zwischen Veranstalter und Ticketerwerber zustande. XING handelt insoweit ausschlie\u00dflich als gewerblicher Vertreter bzw. als Vermittler, der im Namen und auf Rechnung des Veranstalters handelt und in dessen Auftrag den Kaufvertrag abwickelt. Aus diesem Grund haftet XING auch insbesondere nicht f\u00fcr eine Insolvenz des Veranstalters oder den Ausfall einer Veranstaltung.\n1.2\nDie Informationen \u00fcber die jeweilige Veranstaltung, die Anzahl der verf\u00fcgbaren Tickets, der Ticketpreis sowie die verf\u00fcgbaren Zahlungsmethoden richten sich ausschlie\u00dflich nach den Einstellungen, die der jeweilige Veranstalter bei der Erstellung des Angebots f\u00fcr die Veranstaltung auf der XING Website gemacht hat. XING hat auf diese Einstellungen keinerlei Einfluss; die Verantwortung f\u00fcr die Richtigkeit der Einstellungen obliegt dem Veranstalter.\n1.3\nF\u00fcr die Durchf\u00fchrung der vom Veranstalter angebotenen Veranstaltung gelten m\u00f6glicherweise zus\u00e4tzliche Gesch\u00e4ftsbedingungen des jeweiligen Veranstalters.

Der Ticketerwerber nimmt sein Angebot f\u00fcr den Abschluss eines Kaufvertrages an, indem er in der jeweiligen Bestellmaske auf den entsprechenden Button klickt. Die wirksame Annahme des Angebots durch den Ticketerwerber setzt voraus, dass der Ticketerwerber in der Bestellmaske alle erforderlichen Felder ausgef\u00fcllt hat. Unverz\u00fcglich nach Vertragsschluss erh\u00e4lt der Ticketerwerber eine Best\u00e4tigungs-E-Mail \u00fcber den Abschluss des Kaufvertrages.

Die Erkl\u00e4rung der Stornierung bzw. des R\u00fccktritts kann auch konkludent durch Gutschrift der gezahlten Betr\u00e4ge erfolgen. \u00a7 350 BGB findet keine Anwendung.\n1.6\nDer Veranstalter stimmt zu, dass XING Rechnungen an Ticketerwerber ausschlie\u00dflich in elektronischer Form versendet.\n\u00a0\nWiderrufsbelehrung\nSie k\u00f6nnen Ihre Vertragserkl\u00e4rung innerhalb von 14 Tagen ohne Angabe von Gr\u00fcnden in Textform (z.

Die Frist beginnt nach Erhalt dieser Belehrung in Textform, jedoch nicht vor Vertragsschluss und auch nicht vor Erf\u00fcllung unserer Informationspflichten gem\u00e4\u00df Artikel 246 \u00a7 2 in Verbindung mit \u00a7 1 Abs. 1 und 2 EGBGB sowie unserer Pflichten gem\u00e4\u00df \u00a7 312g Abs. 1 Satz 1 BGB in Verbindung mit Artikel 246 \u00a7 3 EGBGB. Zur Wahrung der Widerrufsfrist gen\u00fcgt die rechtzeitige Absendung des Widerrufs. Der Widerruf ist zu richten an:\nXING Events GmbH\nSandstr. 33\n80335 M\u00fcnchen\nFax: +49 89 552 73 58-10\nE-Mail: info@xing-events.com\nWiderrufsfolgen\nIm Falle eines wirksamen Widerrufs sind die beiderseits empfangenen Leistungen zur\u00fcck zu gew\u00e4hren und ggf. gezogene Nutzungen (z.

Gebrauchsvorteile) nicht oder teilweise nicht oder nur in verschlechtertem Zustand zur\u00fcckgew\u00e4hren beziehungsweise herausgeben, m\u00fcssen Sie uns insoweit Wertersatz leisten. Dies kann dazu f\u00fchren, dass Sie die vertraglichen Zahlungsverpflichtungen f\u00fcr den Zeitraum bis zum Widerruf gleichwohl erf\u00fcllen m\u00fcssen. Verpflichtungen zur Erstattung von Zahlungen m\u00fcssen innerhalb von 30 Tagen erf\u00fcllt werden. Die Frist beginnt f\u00fcr Sie mit der Absendung Ihrer Widerrufserkl\u00e4rung, f\u00fcr uns mit deren Empfang.\nBesondere Hinweise:\nIhr Widerrufsrecht erlischt vorzeitig, wenn der Vertrag von beiden Seiten auf Ihren ausdr\u00fccklichen Wunsch vollst\u00e4ndig erf\u00fcllt ist, bevor Sie Ihr Widerrufsrecht ausge\u00fcbt haben.\n- Ende der Widerrufsbelehrung -\nAusschluss des Widerrufsrechts:\nDas Widerrufsrecht besteht nicht, sofern Sie bei Abschluss des Rechtsgesch\u00e4fts in Aus\u00fcbung ihrer gewerblichen oder selbst\u00e4ndigen beruflichen T\u00e4tigkeit handeln und Sie deshalb als Unternehmer anzusehen sind (\u00a7 14 BGB).\nDas Widerrufsrecht gegen\u00fcber XING gilt nicht hinsichtlich solcher Vertr\u00e4ge, die nicht zwischen Ihnen und XING, sondern zwischen Ihnen und einem Dritten zu Stande kommen. Etwaige Widerrufsrechte k\u00f6nnen diesbez\u00fcglich nur gegen\u00fcber dem Dritten geltend gemacht werden. Deshalb besteht hinsichtlich des Ticketkaufs im Rahmen der Veranstaltungsplattform gegen\u00fcber XING kein Widerrufsrecht.\nWeitere wichtige Hinweise:\nSie stimmen ausdr\u00fccklich zu, dass wir vor Ende der Widerrufsfrist mit der Ausf\u00fchrung der Dienstleistung beginnen.\nF\u00fcr Leistungen, die von uns im Zeitraum bis zum Widerruf f\u00fcr Sie erbracht wurden, sind von Ihnen die vereinbarten Entgelte zu entrichten.\n\u00a0\nBestimmungen f\u00fcr Teilnehmer\n3.1\nVersand, Verlust und Reklamation der Tickets\n(a) Unmittelbar nach Zahlungseingang oder nach Bestellung (nur bei Kauf auf Rechnung) verschickt XING ein gekauftes Ticket an die vom Teilnehmer bei der Bestellung angegebene postalische oder elektronische Adresse, sofern nichts anderes vereinbart wurde (z. B. Aufbewahrung der Tickets am Veranstaltungsort).\n(b) Es obliegt dem Teilnehmer, die Richtigkeit des an ihn verschickten Tickets selbst zu \u00fcberpr\u00fcfen, um ggf. rechtzeitig vor Veranstaltungsbeginn eine Ersatzlieferung von XING zu veranlassen.\n(c) Elektronische Tickets k\u00f6nnen vom Teilnehmer jederzeit nochmals angefordert werden.\n(d) Dem Teilnehmer abhanden gekommene oder zerst\u00f6rte Tickets, welche postalisch versendet wurden, werden durch XING nicht ersetzt.\n3.2\nR\u00fcckgabe von Tickets, Erstattung des Kaufpreises\n(a) Wird eine Veranstaltung abgesagt oder verschoben, so bestimmt sich das Recht des Ticketerwerbers ein schon gekauftes Ticket zur\u00fcckzugeben nach den gesetzlichen Bestimmungen sowie den Vereinbarungen, die der Ticketerwerber mit dem Veranstalter getroffen hat.\n(b) Ist der Ticketerwerber zur R\u00fcckgabe eines Tickets berechtigt, so wird XING dem Ticketerwerber den schon gezahlten Kaufpreis nach Ma\u00dfgabe der Vereinbarung des Ticketerwerbers mit dem Veranstalter (insbesondere hinsichtlich etwaiger Stornogeb\u00fchren) innerhalb von vierzehn (14) Tagen ab Erhalt des zur\u00fcckgegebenen Tickets erstatten, wenn XING das Ticketentgelt noch nicht an den Veranstalter ausgezahlt hat. Wenn XING das Ticketentgelt bereits an den Veranstalter ausgezahlt hat, besteht kein Anspruch des Ticketerwerbers gegen XING auf R\u00fcckzahlung.\nBestimmungen f\u00fcr Veranstalter\n3.3\nAllgemeine Anforderungen\n(a) Der Veranstalter ist verpflichtet, Ticketerwerber auf ein eventuell bestehendes Widerrufs- bzw. R\u00fcckgaberecht hinzuweisen und entsprechend ordnungsgem\u00e4\u00df zu belehren. Sofern eine gesetzliche Pflicht zur Verf\u00fcgbarmachung von Gesch\u00e4ftsbedingungen besteht, so ist der Veranstalter auch dazu verpflichtet.\n(b) Wird eine Veranstaltung, f\u00fcr die Tickets noch \u00fcber XING vertrieben werden bzw. wurden oder schon verkauft sind, abgesagt oder hinsichtlich Datum, Uhrzeit, Veranstaltungsort oder im Hinblick auf andere wesentliche Faktoren ge\u00e4ndert, teilt der Veranstalter unverz\u00fcglich nach Kenntniserlangung XING die entsprechende Veranstaltungs\u00e4nderung mit.\n(c) Der Veranstalter sichert XING zu, dass (i) keine Vereinbarung oder sonstige Absprache zwischen dem Veranstalter und einem Veranstaltungsort, oder dem Tr\u00e4ger oder Betreiber eines Veranstaltungsortes, oder einem Dritten besteht, welche den Veranstalter daran hindert oder ihn darin beschr\u00e4nkt, die Veranstaltungsplattform-Leistungen nach Ma\u00dfgabe dieser AGB zu beziehen; (ii) der Veranstalter zum Abschluss dieser Vereinbarung berechtigt ist, einschlie\u00dflich der Befugnis, XING nach Ma\u00dfgabe dieser AGB mit der Vermittlung und dem Verkauf von Tickets zu beauftragen; und (iii) der Veranstalter das Recht hat, die auf den XING Websites angebotene Veranstaltung durchzuf\u00fchren oder zu vermarkten und (iv) nach Kenntnis des Veranstalters kein die Durchf\u00fchrung der Veranstaltung hindernder Grund besteht. Der Veranstalter verpflichtet sich, die in dieser Ziffer get\u00e4tigten Zusicherungen gegen\u00fcber XING auf Anfrage nachzuweisen.\n(d) Der Veranstalter beauftragt und bevollm\u00e4chtigt XING hiermit, f\u00fcr die Dauer der Laufzeit dieses Vertrages als Vertreter im Namen und f\u00fcr die Rechnung des Veranstalters der \u00d6ffentlichkeit die Tickets f\u00fcr die Veranstaltung, die der Veranstalter \u00fcber die XING Websites organisiert, plant oder in sonstiger Weise darbietet, den Kauf von Tickets zu dieser Veranstaltung \u00fcber die XING Websites zu vermitteln, den Zahlungsverkehr mit den Ticketerwerbern bzw. deren jeweiligen Kreditinstituten abzuwickeln und die Tickets an die Teilnehmer zu versenden.\n(e) Die Abf\u00fchrung der Umsatzsteuer oder sonstiger anfallender Steuern aus Ticketverk\u00e4ufen obliegt dem Veranstalter.\n3.4\nTicketpreise und Entgelte\n(a) Der Veranstalter bestimmt den Grundpreis f\u00fcr die Tickets nach freiem Ermessen. Der Grundpreis steht dem Veranstalter zu, sofern die Entgelte in den Ziffern 3.4 (b) bis 3.4 (f) an den Ticketerwerber weiterberechnet und auf den Grundpreis aufgeschlagen werden. Der Veranstalter kann bei der Preisgestaltung f\u00fcr die Tickets festlegen, ob diese Entgelte auf den Grundpreis aufgeschlagen werden. Die Weiterberechnung bezieht sich nur auf die Darstellung des Ticketpreises; die Entgelte werden immer gegen\u00fcber dem Veranstalter berechnet.\n(b) XING erh\u00e4lt von dem Veranstalter f\u00fcr die Leistungen im Rahmen der Veranstaltungsplattform sowie f\u00fcr die Nutzung der XING Websites durch den Veranstalter ein Entgelt (\"Ticketing-Geb\u00fchr\") nach der jeweils g\u00fcltigen Preisliste bzw. gem\u00e4\u00df gesonderter Vereinbarung. Die Ticketing-Geb\u00fchr ist auch zu zahlen, wenn die Tickets am Veranstaltungsort hinterlegt und bezahlt werden.\n(c) Soweit ein postalischer Versand der Tickets von XING angeboten wird und vom Ticketerwerber gew\u00e4hlt wurde, erh\u00e4lt XING von dem Veranstalter f\u00fcr den Versand von Tickets auf dem Postweg ein Entgelt (\"Versandgeb\u00fchr\"). Die H\u00f6he der Versandgeb\u00fchr richtet sich nach der jeweils g\u00fcltigen Preisliste.\n(d) Weitere Entgelte fallen gem\u00e4\u00df der jeweils g\u00fcltigen Preisliste insbesondere f\u00fcr den Verkauf und den Versand von Merchandising-Artikeln, f\u00fcr zus\u00e4tzliche Produkte und Dienstleistungen und im Fall der R\u00fcckabwicklung von vermittelten Ticketk\u00e4ufen an.\n(e) Gelangt eine Veranstaltung aus Gr\u00fcnden, die nicht XING zu vertreten hat, nicht zur Durchf\u00fchrung, so werden die Entgelte f\u00fcr bereits durch XING erbrachte Leistungen trotzdem f\u00e4llig.\n(f) Sofern Entgelte f\u00fcr durch XING erbrachte Leistungen nicht in der Preisliste aufgef\u00fchrt sind, sind sie bei Benutzung des jeweiligen Services auf den XING Websites ausgewiesen. Soweit nicht anders angegeben, werden die zuvor genannten Entgelte zuz\u00fcglich der jeweils derzeit g\u00fcltigen Umsatzsteuer berechnet.\n3.5\nR\u00fcckabwicklung\n(a) Wird die Veranstaltung abgesagt oder wird bzw. werden Tickets aufgrund einer sonstigen Veranstaltungs\u00e4nderung vom Ticketerwerber berechtigterweise zur\u00fcckgegeben, beauftragt der Veranstalter XING die f\u00fcr diese Veranstaltung von dem Ticketerwerber f\u00fcr den Erwerb seiner bzw. seines Tickets bereits gezahlten Gelder inklusive aller Geb\u00fchren im Sinne der Ziffer 3.4 (a) an den Ticketerwerber innerhalb von vierzehn (14) Tagen zur\u00fcckzuzahlen. Der Veranstalter bevollm\u00e4chtigt XING insoweit, die an die Ticketerwerber zur\u00fcckzuzahlenden Gelder an diese im Namen und auf Rechnung des Veranstalters wieder zur\u00fcckzuzahlen.\n(b) F\u00fcr die Abwicklung der R\u00fcckerstattung gem\u00e4\u00df Ziffer 3.5 (a) hat der Veranstalter eine zus\u00e4tzliche Stornogeb\u00fchr pro Ticket gem\u00e4\u00df der jeweils g\u00fcltigen Preisliste an XING zu zahlen. Nach der erfolgten Abwicklung erh\u00e4lt der Veranstalter eine Abrechnung \u00fcber die zu zahlenden Geb\u00fchren, sp\u00e4testens jedoch ein (1) Jahr nach dem urspr\u00fcnglich festgelegten Termin der Veranstaltung. XING ist zu Zwischenabrechnungen berechtigt, jedoch nicht verpflichtet. Etwaige innerhalb eines (1) Jahres seit dem urspr\u00fcnglich festgelegten Termin der Veranstaltung von Ticketerwerbern nicht angeforderte Erstattungsbetr\u00e4ge zahlt XING an den Veranstalter aus.\n(c) XING verpflichtet sich, namens und im Auftrag des Veranstalters die R\u00fcckabwicklung bei Widerruf eines Ticketkaufes f\u00fcr die \u00fcber die XING Websites get\u00e4tigten Ticketk\u00e4ufe durchzuf\u00fchren, wenn\n---\nXING dazu gesetzlich verpflichtet ist; oder\n---\nder Veranstalter dies w\u00fcnscht oder gestattet.\nDer Veranstalter bevollm\u00e4chtigt XING insoweit, die von Ticketerwerbern jeweils erhaltenen Gelder f\u00fcr die Tickets an diese im Namen und auf Rechnung des Veranstalters wieder zur\u00fcckzuzahlen. F\u00fcr die Abwicklung der R\u00fcckerstattung hat der Veranstalter ein zus\u00e4tzliches Stornoentgelt pro Ticket gem\u00e4\u00df der jeweils g\u00fcltigen Preisliste an XING zu zahlen. Nach der erfolgten Abwicklung erh\u00e4lt der Veranstalter eine Abrechnung \u00fcber die zu zahlenden Geb\u00fchren, sp\u00e4testens jedoch ein (1) Jahr nach dem urspr\u00fcnglich festgelegten Termin der Veranstaltung.\n3.6\nBetrugs- / Missbrauchsschutz\n(a) XING verf\u00fcgt \u00fcber ein umfangreiches Sicherheitssystem, das Veranstalter insbesondere bei Ticketk\u00e4ufen mittels Kreditkarten vor R\u00fcckbuchungen ihrer Erl\u00f6se sch\u00fctzt. Aufgrund des Betrugsschutzsystems ist es m\u00f6glich, dass Zahlungen in Ausnahmef\u00e4llen durch dritte Zahlungsanbieter/Banken oder durch die Bank des Ticketerwerbers nicht akzeptiert werden.\n(b) Besteht der Verdacht, dass XING durch den Veranstalter missbr\u00e4uchlich genutzt wird, beh\u00e4lt sich XING das Recht vor, die Ticketverkaufsfunktion zu deaktivieren und den Ticketverkauf zu unterbinden. Ein Verdacht auf missbr\u00e4uchliche Nutzung liegt insbesondere dann vor, wenn\n---\nim Vorfeld der Veranstaltung bekannt wird, dass die Veranstaltung nicht oder nicht so wie gegen\u00fcber denTicketerwerbern bzw. Teilnehmern verlautbart stattfinden soll;\n---\ngesetzeswidrige oder sittenwidrige Veranstaltungen durchgef\u00fchrt werden sollen;\n---\ndie R\u00fcckbuchungsquote f\u00fcr diese Veranstaltung \u00fcberdurchschnittlich hoch ist; oder\n---\nInformationen vorliegen, die den Schluss zulassen, dass der Veranstalter nicht berechtigt ist, Tickets f\u00fcr die jeweilige Veranstaltung zum Verkauf anzubieten.\nKann der Verdacht nach drei\u00dfig (30) Tagen nicht ausger\u00e4umt werden, beh\u00e4lt sich XING das Recht vor, eine R\u00fcckabwicklung vorzunehmen und den Ticketerwerbern die Gelder f\u00fcr die jeweiligen Tickets zur\u00fcckzuzahlen.\n\u00a0\nBestimmungen f\u00fcr Veranstalter \n4.1\nDer Veranstalter kann ausw\u00e4hlen, welche von XING angebotenen Zahlungsm\u00f6glichkeiten (beispielsweise Kreditkarte, Lastschriftverfahren, Vorauskasse, Rechnung, PayPal) den Ticketerwerbern zur Verf\u00fcgung gestellt werden sollen, um die Erl\u00f6se durch XING einzuziehen. Entsprechend dieser Auswahl des Veranstalters \u00fcbernimmt XING den Einzug der Zahlungen der Ticketerwerber f\u00fcr die Tickets und verwaltet das insoweit eingezogene Geld auf einem separaten Konto. Der Veranstalter r\u00e4umt XING insoweit eine entsprechende Vollmacht ein.\n4.2\nXING \u00fcberweist das gem\u00e4\u00df Ziffer 4.1 eingezogene Geld unter Abzug des an XING nach Ziffer 3.4 zu zahlenden Entgelts in der Regel jeweils bis zum 10. Tag des Folgemonats des festgelegten Termins der Veranstaltung. XING beh\u00e4lt sich insbesondere dann vor, von dieser Regel abzuweichen und die Einnahmen l\u00e4nger einzubehalten, wenn ein Verdacht hinsichtlich eines Missbrauchs besteht. Die \u00dcberweisung der weiterzuleitenden Betr\u00e4ge erfolgt auf die Bankverbindung, die im Nutzerkonto des Veranstalters im System der XING Websites hinterlegt ist. Nach \u00dcberweisung der Betr\u00e4ge auf diese Bankverbindung ist der Vertrag von Seiten XING erf\u00fcllt. XING beh\u00e4lt sich das Recht vor bei wiederkehrenden Veranstaltungen auch vor dem Stattfinden der Veranstaltung Gelder auszuzahlen. Ein Anspruch hierauf seitens des Veranstalters besteht nicht. F\u00fcr R\u00fcckbuchungsgeb\u00fchren auf Grund einer fehlerhaft durch den Veranstalter hinterlegten Bankverbindung \u00fcbernimmt XING keine Haftung und beh\u00e4lt sich das Recht vor, diese dem Veranstalter weiter zu belasten. Bei \u00dcberweisungen an Kontoinhaber au\u00dferhalb der Europ\u00e4ischen W\u00e4hrungsunion kann es zu Differenzen aufgrund von m\u00f6glichen W\u00e4hrungsumrechnungen und Bankgeb\u00fchren bei den Zahlungseing\u00e4ngen kommen. Diese Differenzen gehen zu Lasten des Veranstalters und sind nicht von XING zu tragen.\n4.3\nDem Veranstalter ist bewusst, dass bei bestimmten Zahlungsarten (z. B. Lastschrift oder Kreditkarte) das Risiko einer R\u00fcckbuchung durch den Ticketerwerber besteht und dass allein der Veranstalter dieses Risiko zu tragen hat. R\u00fcckbuchungen, die nach bereits erfolgter Auszahlung gem\u00e4\u00df Ziffer 4.2 an den Veranstalter erfolgen, werden dem Veranstalter zuz\u00fcglich einer R\u00fcckbuchungsgeb\u00fchr gem\u00e4\u00df jeweils g\u00fcltiger Preisliste in Rechnung gestellt.\n4.4\nDer Veranstalter ist verpflichtet, Einwendungen gegen die von XING gestellten Abrechnungen unverz\u00fcglich, sp\u00e4testens jedoch vier (4) Wochen nach der Abrechnung geltend zu machen. Andernfalls gilt die Abrechnung als genehmigt.\n4.5\nDer Veranstalter ist sich dar\u00fcber bewusst, dass bei bestimmten Zahlarten (v.a. \"Rechnung\" und \"Vorauskasse\") gegebenenfalls Rechnungsbetr\u00e4ge von Ticketk\u00e4ufern als offene Positionen unbezahlt bleiben. Dieses Risiko ist vom Veranstalter zu tragen. Das Inkasso obliegt dem Veranstalter.\nBestimmungen f\u00fcr Ticketerwerber\n4.6\nDie Abrechnung der Nutzung dieser Leistung via Kreditkarte oder Sofort\u00fcberweisung erfolgt durch:\nWirecard Bank AG\nEinsteinring 35\n85609 Aschheim\nDeutschland\nAmtsgericht M\u00fcnchen: HRB 161 178\nUSt-IdNr.: DE 207567674\nVorstand: Daniel Heuser, Alexander von Knoop, Rainer Wexeler\nAufsichtsratsvorsitzender: Wulf Matthias\nTel. +49 (0)89 4424 2000\nFax +49 (0)89 4424 2100\nservice@wirecardbank.com\nwww.wirecardbank.com\nInformationen zum Datenschutz:\nhttps://www.wirecardbank.de/DSGVO\n4.7\nAbh\u00e4ngig von der Vereinbarung, die XING mit dem jeweiligen Veranstalter getroffen hat, werden die Geb\u00fchren f\u00fcr die Abwicklung des Ticketkaufs auf den Ticketpreis aufgeschlagen und dann bei der Bestellung im Ticketshop separat angezeigt. Durch gebuchte Zusatzprodukte oder -dienstleistungen kann sich der Gesamtkaufpreis weiter erh\u00f6hen. Sofern bei Zahlungen aus dem Ausland Geb\u00fchren oder W\u00e4hrungsdifferenzen anfallen, werden diese vom Ticketerwerber getragen. Im Ticketshop wird angezeigt, ob der Ticketpreis inklusive oder exklusive Umsatzsteuer ist.\n4.8\nDer Gesamtkaufpreis ist nach Erhalt der Best\u00e4tigungs-E-Mail sofort zur Zahlung f\u00e4llig.\n\u00a0\n4.9\nBezahlungen mittels Lastschriftverfahren werden von XING mit einer Vorank\u00fcndigungsfrist von sechs (6) Werktagen eingezogen.

Unless otherwise specified in the additional terms that apply to the Services you are using, the terms in this Section 11 apply to you.\r\n\t\nWe offer products and subscriptions for a fee (\u201cfee-based Services\u201d). These fee-based Services are governed by the additional terms you agree to when you register for the fee-based Service and these Terms. If you register for a fee-based Service, you must designate a payment method and provide us with accurate billing and payment information and you have the continuing obligation to keep it up to date. Many fee-based Services require you to have, or register for, a Yahoo or AOL or other Oath ID. If you are an AOL Dial-Up customer, please find additional terms here.\nThe following important provisions apply to all of our fee-based services:\r\n\t\t\nThird-Party products. If the fee-based Service includes a third-party product, you understand and agree that your purchase and use of the Service is also subject to the third party\u2019s terms of service and privacy policy, which you should read thoroughly before agreeing to them.\nPayments. You represent that you are at least the minimum age required to enter into a legal agreement. You agree to pay us for any fee-based Services you purchase from us, as well as all other charges incurred under your account, including applicable taxes and fees. You are responsible for all charges incurred under your account, including purchases made by you or anyone you allow to use your account or any sub-or linked accounts (including any person with implied, actual, or apparent authority) or anyone who gains access to your account as a result of your failure to safeguard your authentication credentials.\nPayment Methods. You authorize and direct us to charge your designated payment method for these charges or, if it fails, to charge any other payment method you have on file with us, even if we received it in association with other fee-based services. You are responsible for all charges even if your payment method fails or is denied. You authorize and direct us to retain all information about any payment method(s) associated with your account. We may import payment information you entered during a prior purchase and provide you the option to use that payment information during purchase of a new product. You permit us to obtain and use updated information from the issuer of your payment method in accordance with the policies and procedures of any applicable card brands. We may in some instances continue charging a payment method past its expiration date at our discretion and subject to the payment processors' or issuing bank's approval. Surcharges may apply if you use certain payment methods, such as payment from your checking or savings account.\nPayment Terms. We may charge for fee-based Services in advance and on a daily, monthly, yearly, lump sum, or other basis in accordance with the stated terms, as long as your subscription remains active, even if you have not downloaded or used the Service or accessed your online account.\nAuto-Renewal. We use auto-renewal for many of our fee-based Services. At the expiration of each subscription term for such fee-based Services, we will automatically renew your subscription and charge the credit card or other payment method you have provided to us, unless you cancel your subscription at least 48 hours before the end of the current period. Unless otherwise stated in Section 14, your subscription will be automatically renewed at the then-current price, excluding promotional and discount pricing. We may, in our sole discretion, post charges to your payment method individually or aggregate charges for some or all of your fee-based Services with us.\nFraud Protection. We may take steps to verify the validity of the credit card information you provide to us, including debiting amounts less than $1.00 from your credit card and then immediately crediting it back. You authorize us to do so for verification and anti-fraud purposes.\nFree Trials. We may offer you free trials, so that you may try a fee-based Service subscription without charge or obligation (\"Free Trial\"). Unless otherwise stated and unless you cancel your subscription prior to the expiration of the Free Trial, periodic subscription fees will be charged at the then-applicable rate upon expiration of the Free Trial period and will continue to be charged until the subscription is canceled. If you are not satisfied with a particular fee-based Service, you must cancel the subscription before the Free Trial ends to avoid charges. We reserve the right to limit you to one free trial or promotion of a fee-based Service and to prohibit the combining of free trials or other promotional offers.\nNo Refunds. All charges are nonrefundable unless provided otherwise in the terms you agree to when you register for a fee-based Service, unless stated differently for your country in Section 15 or as otherwise specified below.\nTermination. We, in our sole discretion, may change, discontinue or terminate any or all aspects of a fee-based Service without notice, including access to support services, content and other products or services ancillary to the fee-based Service, subject to providing an appropriate refund for any portions of a specified but no longer available term. You may cancel a fee-based Service at any time by logging into your online account and terminating the\u00a0subscription.\nChange in Fees and Billing Method. We may change our fees and billing methods at any time. We will provide you with notice of any price increase at least thirty (30) days in advance. Subject to applicable law, (i) if you disagree with any proposed change, your sole remedy is to cancel your fee-based Service before the price change takes effect and (ii) your continued use of or subscription to the Service after the price change takes effect constitutes your agreement to pay the new price for the Service.\nDelinquency. After 30 days from the date of any unpaid charges, your fee-based Service will be deemed delinquent and we may terminate or suspend your account and fee-based Service for nonpayment. You are liable for any fees, including attorney and collection fees, incurred by us in our efforts to collect any remaining balances from you.\n90-Day Notice Period. You must notify us about any billing problems or discrepancies within 90 days after they first appear on your billing method statement. If you do not bring them to our attention within 90 days, you agree that you waive your right to dispute such problems or discrepancies.\n---About these Terms\nThird Party Beneficiaries and Conflicts. These Terms control the relationship between Oath and you. They do not create any third party beneficiary rights. If there is a conflict or inconsistency between the terms in this document and the additional terms associated with a particular Service, the additional terms will control solely for that conflict or inconsistency.\nModification of the Terms. Unless stated differently for your country in Section 14, we may modify the Terms from time to time. Unless we indicate otherwise, modifications will be effective as of the date they are posted on this page or any successor page. You should look at the Terms regularly. We will provide notice (in accordance with Section 3(c) above) of material modifications.\nContinued Use of the Services. You may stop using the Services at any time, but your continued use of or subscription to a Service after the effective date of any modifications to the Terms or the means that you agree to the Terms as modified.\nWaiver and Severability of Terms. The failure of Oath to exercise or enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not constitute a waiver of such right or provision. If any provision (or part of a provision) of these Terms is found to be invalid, Oath and you nevertheless agree to give effect to the intentions as reflected in the provision, and the other provisions of these Terms remain in full force and effect.\nAssignment by Oath. Oath may freely assign these Terms and all of the policies and other documents incorporated or referenced in it (including all rights, licenses, and obligations under it or them), in whole or in part and without notice, for any reason, including for the purpose of internal restructuring (for example, mergers or liquidations).\n---Provider of Services\nThe Services are provided by the company that offers the Services in your region as set out in Section 14.2\u00a0(the \u201cApplicable Oath Company\u201d), except for the Services set out below in Section 13(b).

YOU AND OATH BOTH AGREE TO RESOLVE ANY AND ALL DISPUTES, CONTROVERSIES OR CLAIMS THAT IN ANY WAY ARISE OUT OF OR RELATE TO THESE TERMS OR FROM ANY SERVICES YOU RECEIVE FROM US (OR FROM ANY ADVERTISING FOR ANY SUCH SERVICES), INCLUDING ANY DISPUTES BETWEEN YOU AND OUR EMPLOYEES OR AGENTS (\u201cDISPUTE(S)\u201d), ONLY BY ARBITRATION ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS OR IN SMALL CLAIMS COURT. YOU UNDERSTAND THAT BY AGREEING TO THESE TERMS, ARBITRATION OR A SMALL CLAIMS ACTION WILL BE THE SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE MEANS OF RESOLVING ANY DISPUTE BETWEEN US. YOU ALSO UNDERSTAND THAT BY AGREEING TO THESE TERMS, YOU AND OATH ARE GIVING UP THE RIGHT TO BRING A CLAIM IN COURT OR IN FRONT OF A JURY (EXCEPT FOR MATTERS THAT MAY BE BROUGHT IN SMALL CLAIMS COURT), AND THAT YOU AND OATH ARE GIVING UP THE RIGHT TO PROCEED WITH ANY CLASS ACTION OR OTHER REPRESENTATIVE ACTION. WHILE ARBITRATION PROCEDURES MAY BE DIFFERENT THAN COURT PROCEDURES, AN ARBITRATOR CAN AWARD YOU INDIVIDUALLY THE SAME DAMAGES AND RELIEF AS A COURT, AND JUDGMENT ON THE AWARD RENDERED BY THE ARBITRATOR MAY BE ENTERED AND ENFORCED IN ANY COURT HAVING JURISDICTION THEREOF. THE PARTIES UNDERSTAND THAT ABSENT THIS MANDATORY PROVISION, THEY WOULD HAVE THE RIGHT TO SUE IN COURT AND HAVE A JURY TRIAL. THEY FURTHER UNDERSTAND THAT, IN SOME INSTANCES, THE COSTS OF ARBITRATION COULD EXCEED THE COSTS OF LITIGATION AND THE RIGHT TO DISCOVERY MAY BE MORE LIMITED IN ARBITRATION THAN IN COURT. We also both agree that:\nNotice of Dispute. If either you or Oath intends to arbitrate under these Terms, the party seeking arbitration must first notify the other party of the Dispute in writing at least 30 days in advance of initiating the arbitration. Notice to Oath should be sent to Oath either by mail to Oath, Attn: Disputes, 701 First Avenue, Sunnyvale, CA 94089; or disputes@oath.com. Notice to you will be to your email address(es) and street address(es), if any, that Oath has in its records at the time the notice is sent. The notice must describe the nature of the claim and the relief being sought. If we are unable to resolve the Dispute within 30 days, either party may then proceed to file a claim for arbitration.\nArbitration Procedure. The Federal Arbitration Act applies to these Terms. Except for small claims court cases, any and all Disputes will be resolved by arbitration administered by the American Arbitration Association (\"AAA\"). The AAA will apply the Commercial Arbitration Rules to the arbitration of any Dispute pursuant to these Terms, unless you are an individual and use the Services for personal or household use, in which case the AAA's Consumer Arbitration Rules will apply (excluding any rules or procedures governing or permitting class actions). You can get procedures (including the process for beginning an arbitration), rules and fee information from the AAA (www.adr.org). These Terms govern to the extent they conflict with the AAA\u2019s Commercial Arbitration Rules or Consumer Arbitration Rules.\nSmall Claims Court Option. As an alternative to arbitration, you may bring an individual action in small claims court in your county of residence (or if a business, your principal place of business) or Santa Clara County, California provided that your Dispute meets the requirements of the small claims court.\nArbitration Location. Unless you and Oath agree otherwise, the arbitration must take place, or the small claims action must be filed, in the county of your primary residence or Santa Clara County, California.\nArbitration Fees and Expenses. We will reimburse any filing fee that the AAA charges you for arbitration of the Dispute. If you provide us with signed written notice that you cannot pay the filing fee, we will pay the fee directly to the AAA. If the arbitration proceeds, we will also pay any administrative and arbitrator fees charged later.\nSettlement Offers. We may, but are not obligated to, make a written settlement offer anytime before or during arbitration. The amount or terms of any settlement offer may not be disclosed to the arbitrator unless and until the arbitrator issues an award on the claim. If you do not accept the offer and the arbitrator awards you an amount of money that is more than our offer but less than $5,000, we agree to: (a) pay you $5,000 instead of the lower amount awarded, (b) pay your reasonable attorney\u2019s fees and costs, and (c) reimburse any arbitration filing fees and arbitrator fees and expenses incurred in connection with the arbitration of your Dispute. If the arbitrator awards you more than $5,000 and we are not challenging the award, then we will pay you the amount of the award.\nSeverability. If any part of this agreement to arbitrate is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be unenforceable, the court will reform the agreement to the extent necessary to cure the unenforceable part(s), and the parties will arbitrate their Dispute(s) without reference to or reliance upon the unenforceable part(s). However, if for any reason the Class Action Waiver set forth below in subsection 14.2.c cannot be enforced as to some or all of the Dispute, then the agreement to arbitrate will not apply to that Dispute or portion thereof. Any Disputes covered by any deemed unenforceable Class Action Waiver provision may only be litigated in a court of competent jurisdiction, but the remainder of the agreement to arbitrate will be binding and enforceable. To avoid any doubt or uncertainty, the parties do not agree to class arbitration or to the arbitration of any claims brought on behalf of others.\nCLASS ACTION WAIVER FOR U.S. USERS. THESE TERMS DO NOT ALLOW CLASS OR COLLECTIVE ARBITRATIONS, EVEN IF THE AAA PROCEDURES OR RULES WOULD. NOTWITHSTANDING ANY OTHER PROVISION OF THESE TERMS, THE ARBITRATOR MAY AWARD MONEY OR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF ONLY IN FAVOR OF THE INDIVIDUAL PARTY SEEKING RELIEF AND ONLY TO THE EXTENT NECESSARY TO PROVIDE THE RELIEF WARRANTED BY THAT PARTY'S INDIVIDUAL CLAIM. ARBITRATION OR COURT PROCEEDINGS HELD UNDER THESE TERMS CANNOT BE BROUGHT, MAINTAINED OR RESOLVED ON BEHALF OF OR BY A CLASS, AS A PRIVATE ATTORNEY-GENERAL, OR IN ANY OTHER REPRESENTATIVE CAPACITY. IN ADDITION, INDIVIDUAL PROCEEDINGS CANNOT BE COMBINED WITHOUT THE CONSENT OF ALL OF THE PARTIES. ANY QUESTION REGARDING THE ENFORCEABILITY OR INTERPRETATION OF THIS PARAGRAPH WILL BE DECIDED BY A COURT AND NOT THE ARBITRATOR.\nJURY TRIAL WAIVER FOR U.S. USERS. IF FOR ANY REASON A DISPUTE PROCEEDS IN COURT RATHER THAN THROUGH ARBITRATION, YOU AND OATH AGREE THAT THERE WILL NOT BE A JURY TRIAL. YOU AND OATH UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVE ANY RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION, PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM IN ANY WAY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THESE TERMS. IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, THIS PARAGRAPH MAY BE FILED TO SHOW A WRITTEN CONSENT TO A TRIAL BY THE COURT.\nChoice of Law. These Terms and the relationship between the parties, including any claim or dispute that might arise between the parties, whether sounding in contract, tort, or otherwise, will be governed by the laws of the State of New York without regard to its conflict of law provisions. In no event will the parties bring claims against one another under the laws of another jurisdiction.\nForum. If for any reason a Dispute proceeds in court rather than through arbitration, all such Disputes (regardless of theory) arising out of or relating to these Terms, or the relationship between you and Oath, will be brought exclusively in the courts located in the county of New York, New York or the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York. In such cases, you and Oath agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of the courts located within the county of New York, New York or the Southern District of New York, and agree to waive any and all objections to the exercise of jurisdiction over the parties by such courts and to venue in such courts.\nCustomer Support.

It was then be delivered to Congress on CDs, in keeping with the organisation's slightly archaic way of delivering documents.But when it came to the public, it arrive in the form of a PDF, uploaded to the Justice Department website in the first instance.The rush of internet traffic to the site is expected to be significant. Though the US government should have made preparations for such high interest, it is nonetheless possible that the website might not work quickly or at all when it first drops.But it will almost certainly be passed around other websites and hosting services as soon as it is made available, meaning that it should be accessible in some form.Barnes & Noble is offering the full report as an ebook, free to download for owners of its Nook ereader. \"This is a PDF/direct replica of historic The Mueller Report as released by the U.S. Department of Justice, Barr redactions and all, and it is essential reading for all Americans on both sides of the aisle,\" the overview on its website reads.The retailer said people can pre-order it now from the website and suggested it will arrive as soon as it is released.The report will be widely distributed after it is released, meaning that it will probably be made available for other ereaders, too. Anyone giving away the report should be doing so for free, so while it is likely that links and versions of the PDF will be sold online, such listings are best avoided.When the Starr Report, the final findings of an investigation into Bill Clinton, were published in 1998, they swiftly became one of the most popular documents of all time.Some 12 per cent of all Americans - 20 million people - headed to the internet to look at the document, according to polling reported by CNN at the time. \"It's probably the single highest number of people who have ever used the computer to access a single document,\" David Webber of the Frank Lutz polling company said then.That time around, the file was made available over seven different US government websites, in an attempt to spread the load. Though those websites and the news organisations that covered the release were swamped by the traffic, the internet nonetheless continued to work, reports at the time said.\nRead Attorney General William Barr's Full Remarks Ahead of the Mueller Report ReleaseTime\n'Game Over' Donald Trump Declares After Bill Barr Spins Robert Mueller Report To MediaDeadline\n---\nCelebrity AOL.com\nJohn F.

We reserve the right to limit you to one free trial or promotion of a fee-based Service and to prohibit the combining of free trials or other promotional offers.\nNo Refunds.

YOU ALSO UNDERSTAND THAT BY AGREEING TO THESE TERMS, YOU AND OATH ARE GIVING UP THE RIGHT TO BRING A CLAIM IN COURT OR IN FRONT OF A JURY (EXCEPT FOR MATTERS THAT MAY BE BROUGHT IN SMALL CLAIMS COURT), AND THAT YOU AND OATH ARE GIVING UP THE RIGHT TO PROCEED WITH ANY CLASS ACTION OR OTHER REPRESENTATIVE ACTION.

Unless you and Oath agree otherwise, the arbitration must take place, or the small claims action must be filed, in the county of your primary residence or Santa Clara County, California.\nArbitration Fees and Expenses. We will reimburse any filing fee that the AAA charges you for arbitration of the Dispute. If you provide us with signed written notice that you cannot pay the filing fee, we will pay the fee directly to the AAA.

We may, but are not obligated to, make a written settlement offer anytime before or during arbitration. The amount or terms of any settlement offer may not be disclosed to the arbitrator unless and until the arbitrator issues an award on the claim. If you do not accept the offer and the arbitrator awards you an amount of money that is more than our offer but less than $5,000, we agree to: (a) pay you $5,000 instead of the lower amount awarded, (b) pay your reasonable attorney\u2019s fees and costs, and (c) reimburse any arbitration filing fees and arbitrator fees and expenses incurred in connection with the arbitration of your Dispute.

However, if for any reason the Class Action Waiver set forth below in subsection 14.2.c cannot be enforced as to some or all of the Dispute, then the agreement to arbitrate will not apply to that Dispute or portion thereof. Any Disputes covered by any deemed unenforceable Class Action Waiver provision may only be litigated in a court of competent jurisdiction, but the remainder of the agreement to arbitrate will be binding and enforceable. To avoid any doubt or uncertainty, the parties do not agree to class arbitration or to the arbitration of any claims brought on behalf of others.\nCLASS ACTION WAIVER FOR U.S. USERS.

THE PARTIES UNDERSTAND THAT ABSENT THIS MANDATORY PROVISION, THEY WOULD HAVE THE RIGHT TO SUE IN COURT AND HAVE A JURY TRIAL.

We also may use your IP address to determine your approximate location, so that we can serve you ads for a nearby pizza delivery service if you search for \u201cpizza.\u201d Learn more about Google ads and why you may see particular ads.For example, when you type an address in the To, Cc, or Bcc field of an email you're composing, Gmail will suggest addresses based on the people you contact most frequently.If you add your phone number to your account, it can be used for different purposes across Google services, depending on your settings. For example, your phone number can be used to help you access your account if you forget your password, help people find and connect with you, and make the ads you see more relevant to you. Learn moreFor example, if you add a credit card or other payment method to your Google Account, you can use it to buy things across our services, like apps in the Play Store. We may also ask for other information, like a business tax ID, to help process your payment. In some cases, we may also need to verify your identity and may ask you for information to do this.We may also use payment information to verify that you meet age requirements, if, for example, you enter an incorrect birthday indicating you\u2019re not old enough to have a Google Account. Learn moreFor example, we can use information from your devices to help you decide which device you\u2019d like to use to install an app or view a movie you buy from Google Play. We also use this information to help protect your account.Android devices with Google apps include devices sold by Google or one of our partners and include phones, cameras, vehicles, wearables, and televisions. These devices use Google Play Services and other pre-installed apps that include services like Gmail, Maps, your phone\u2019s camera and phone dialer, text-to-speech conversion, keyboard input, and security features.For example, we collect information about views and interactions with ads so we can provide aggregated reports to advertisers, like telling them whether we served their ad on a page and whether the ad was likely seen by a viewer. We may also measure other interactions, such as how you move your mouse over an ad or if you interact with the page on which the ad appears.Your Chrome browsing history is only saved to your account if you\u2019ve enabled Chrome synchronization with your Google Account. Learn moreExamples of these services include:---Google Hangouts, for making domestic and international calls---Google Voice, for making calls, sending text messages, and managing voicemail---Google Fi, for a phone planYour device may have sensors that can be used to better understand your location and movement. For example, an accelerometer can be used to determine your speed and a gyroscope to figure out your direction of travel.If you use Google\u2019s Location services on Android, we can improve the performance of apps that rely on your location, like Google Maps. If you use Google\u2019s Location services, your device sends information to Google about its location, sensors (like accelerometer), and nearby cell towers and Wi-Fi access points (like MAC address and signal strength). All these things help to determine your location. You can use your device settings to enable Google Location services. Learn moreFor example, we may collect information that\u2019s publicly available online or from other public sources to help train Google\u2019s language models and build features like Google Translate.For example, information about security threats can help us notify you if we think your account has been compromised (at which point we can help you take steps to protect your account).For example, advertisers may upload data from their loyalty-card programs so that they can better understand the performance of their ad campaigns. We only provide aggregated reports to advertisers that don\u2019t reveal information about individual people.Examples of how we use your information to deliver our services include:---We use the IP address assigned to your device to send you the data you requested, such as loading a YouTube video---We use unique identifiers stored in cookies on your device to help us authenticate you as the person who should have access to your Google Account---Photos and videos you upload to Google Photos are used to help you create albums, animations, and other creations that you can share.

We use this information for things like processing, fulfilling, and delivering your order, and to provide support in connection with the product or service you purchase.For example, we continuously monitor our systems to look for problems. And if we find something wrong with a specific feature, reviewing activity information collected before the problem started allows us to fix things more quickly.For example, we use cookies to analyze how people interact with our services. And that analysis can help us build better products. For example, it may help us discover that it\u2019s taking people too long to complete a certain task or that they have trouble finishing steps at all. We can then redesign that feature and improve the product for everyone.For example, when you\u2019re signed in to your Google Account and have the Web & App Activity control enabled, you can get more relevant search results that are based on your previous searches and activity from other Google services. You can learn more here. You may also get customized search results even when you\u2019re signed out. If you don\u2019t want this level of search customization, you can search and browse privately or turn off signed-out search personalization.You may also see personalized ads based on information from the advertiser. If you shopped on an advertiser's website, for example, they can use that visit information to show you ads. Learn moreWhen showing you personalized ads, we use topics that we think might be of interest to you based on your activity. For example, you may see ads for things like \"Cooking and Recipes\" or \"Air Travel.\u201d We don\u2019t use topics or show personalized ads based on sensitive categories like race, religion, sexual orientation, or health. And we require the same from advertisers that use our services.Google Analytics relies on first-party cookies, which means the cookies are set by the Google Analytics customer. Using our systems, data generated through Google Analytics can be linked by the Google Analytics customer and by Google to third-party cookies that are related to visits to other websites. For example, an advertiser may want to use its Google Analytics data to create more relevant ads, or to further analyze its traffic. Learn moreSome examples of how we use your information to help keep our services safe and reliable include:---Collecting and analyzing IP addresses and cookie data to protect against automated abuse. This abuse takes many forms, such as sending spam to Gmail users, stealing money from advertisers by fraudulently clicking on ads, or censoring content by launching a Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack.---The \u201clast account activity\u201d feature in Gmail can help you find out if and when someone accessed your email without your knowledge. This feature shows you information about recent activity in Gmail, such as the IP addresses that accessed your mail, the associated location, and the date and time of access. Learn moreWhen we detect spam, malware, illegal content, and other forms of abuse on our systems in violation of our policies, we may disable your account or take other appropriate action. In certain circumstances, we may also report the violation to appropriate authorities.Some examples of how we combine the information we collect include:---When you\u2019re signed in to your Google Account and search on Google, you can see search results from the public web, along with relevant information from the content you have in other Google products, like Gmail or Google Calendar. This can include things like the status of your upcoming flights, restaurant, and hotel reservations, or your photos. Learn more---If you have communicated with someone via Gmail and want to add them to a Google Doc or an event in Google Calendar, Google makes it easy to do so by autocompleting their email address when you start to type in their name. This feature makes it easier to share things with people you know. Learn more---The Google app can use data that you have stored in other Google products to show you personalized content, depending on your settings. For example, if you have searches stored in your Web & App Activity, the Google app can show you news articles and other information about your interests, like sports scores, based your activity. Learn more---If you link your Google Account to your Google Home, you can manage your information and get things done through the Google Assistant. For example, you can add events to your Google Calendar or get your schedule for the day, ask for status updates on your upcoming flight, or send information like driving directions to your phone. Learn moreThis activity might come from your use of Google services, like from syncing your account with Chrome or your visits to sites and apps that partner with Google. Many websites and apps partner with Google to improve their content and services. For example, a website might use our advertising services (like AdSense) or analytics tools (like Google Analytics), or it might embed other content (such as videos from YouTube). These services may share information about your activity with Google and, depending on your account settings and the products in use (for instance, when a partner uses Google Analytics in conjunction with our advertising services), this data may be associated with your personal information.Learn more about how Google uses data when you use our partners' sites or apps.There are over 2 million non-Google websites and apps that partner with Google to show ads. Learn moreFor example, you can delete your blog from Blogger or a Google Site you own from Google Sites. You can also delete reviews you\u2019ve left on apps, games, and other content in the Play Store.For example, we use a cookie called \u2018lbcs\u2019 that makes it possible for you to open many Google Docs in one browser. Blocking this cookie would prevent Google Docs from working as expected. Learn moreLike other technology and communications companies, Google regularly receives requests from governments and courts around the world to disclose user data. Respect for the privacy and security of data you store with Google underpins our approach to complying with these legal requests. Our legal team reviews each and every request, regardless of type, and we frequently push back when a request appears to be overly broad or doesn\u2019t follow the correct process. Learn more in our Transparency Report.When lots of people start searching for something, it can provide useful information about particular trends at that time. Google Trends samples Google web searches to estimate the popularity of searches over a certain period of time and shares those results publicly in aggregated terms. Learn moreFor example, we allow YouTube creators and advertisers to work with measurement companies to learn about the audience of their YouTube videos or ads, using cookies or similar technologies. Another example is merchants on our shopping pages, who use cookies to understand how many different people see their product listings. Learn more about these partners and how they use your information.For example, we operate data centers located around the world to help keep our products continuously available for users.For example, we process your information to report use statistics to rights holders about how their content was used in our services.
