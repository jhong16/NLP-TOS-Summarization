We may ask you to supply additional information relevant to your Transaction, including, without limitation, your credit card number, the expiration date of your credit card, your billing address and additional information to verify your identity before completing your Transaction (such information, \u201cPayment Information\u201d). You represent and warrant that you have the legal right to use all payment method(s) represented by any such Payment Information. When you initiate a Transaction, you authorize us to store and continue billing you using your Payment Information and to provide your Payment Information to our third party payment processors as needed to complete your Transactions.  We may also periodically authorize your payment method in anticipation of applicable fees or related charges. Further, as part of our order processing procedures, we may screen orders for fraud or other undesirable activity. If we feel an order could be fraudulent, unauthorized, or illegal, we reserve the right to refuse to process that order. Your Subscription continues until cancelled by you or we terminate your access to or use of the Services or the Subscription in accordance with these Terms.\nIf you elect to purchase an annual or monthly Subscription, you will be charged the annual or monthly Subscription fee (\u201cSubscription Fee\u201d) plus any applicable taxes, at the beginning of your Subscription and each year or month thereafter, respectively, at the then-current rate. If you elect to purchase an annual Subscription, we (or our third party payment processor) will automatically charge you on the anniversary of the commencement of your Subscription using the Payment Information you have provided. If you elect to purchase a monthly Subscription, we (or our third party payment processor) will automatically charge you each month, on the calendar day corresponding to the commencement of your Subscription, using the Payment Information you have provided. In the event your Subscription began on a day not contained in a given month, your payment method will be charged on a day in the applicable month or such other day as we deem appropriate. For example, if you started your Subscription on January 31st, your next payment date is likely to be February 28th, and your payment method would be billed on that date. \nBy agreeing to these Terms and electing to purchase a Subscription, you acknowledge that your Subscription has recurring payment features and you accept responsibility for all recurring payment obligations prior to cancellation of your Subscription by you or Academia.edu.\nFree Trials. We may offer Subscriptions on a free trial basis (\u201cFree Trial\u201d) for a specified period of time. If we offer you a Free Trial, the specific terms of your Free Trial will be provided at signup and/or in the promotional materials describing the Free Trial and your use of the Free Trial is subject to your compliance with such specific terms. Free Trials may not be combined with any other offer. Except as may otherwise be provided in the specific terms for the Free Trial offer, Free Trials are only available to users who have not previously subscribed to the service in connection with which the Free Trial is being offered. When you agree to a Free Trial, you are also agreeing to sign up for a Subscription as described above and, consequently, unless you cancel your Subscription prior to the end of your Free Trial, we (or our third party payment processor) will begin charging your payment method on a recurring basis for the Subscription Fee (plus any applicable taxes) until you cancel your Subscription. Instructions for cancelling your Subscription are stated below in the \u201cCancelling Subscriptions\u201d section. We reserve the right to modify or terminate Free Trials at any time, without notice and in our sole discretion.\nCancelling Subscriptions\nYou may cancel your Subscription at any time.

AFTER THE FIRST THIRTY (30) DAY PERIOD FOLLOWING THE START OF YOUR SUBSCRIPTION YOU WILL NOT RECEIVE A REFUND OF ANY PORTION OF THE SUBSCRIPTION FEE PAID FOR THE THEN CURRENT SUBSCRIPTION PERIOD AT THE TIME OF CANCELLATION. To cancel, you can either (i) email us at support@academia.edu and follow instructions, if any, we provide to you in response to your cancellation request, or (ii) initiate a cancellation through your account settings within the Services. You will be responsible for all Subscription fees incurred for the then current Subscription period. If you cancel, your cancellation will be effective immediately, but Academia.edu will allow you to access the Subscription features until the most recently paid-up Subscription period ends, and then we will terminate your access. Cancelling your Subscription won\u2019t cancel your Account. See the Termination and Account Cancellation section below for information on canceling your Account.\nPlease be aware that any fee or subscription plan is exclusive of all taxes.

If this specific paragraph is held unenforceable, then the entirety of this \u201cDispute Resolution\u201d section will be deemed void. Except as provided in the preceding sentence, this \u201cDispute Resolution\u201d section will survive any termination of these Terms.\nArbitration Rules and Governing Law.  The arbitration will be administered by the American Arbitration Association (\u201cAAA\u201d) in accordance with the Commercial Arbitration Rules and the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (the \u201cAAA Rules\u201d) then in effect, except as modified by this \u201cDispute Resolution\u201d section.  (The AAA Rules are available at www.adr.org/arb_med or by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879.)  The Federal Arbitration Act will govern the interpretation and enforcement of this Section.\nArbitration Process.  A party who desires to initiate arbitration must provide the other party with a written Demand for Arbitration as specified in the AAA Rules.  (The AAA provides a form Demand for Arbitration at http://www.adr.org/aaa/ShowPDF?doc=ADRSTG_004175 and a separate form for California residents at http://www.adr.org/aaa/ShowPDF?doc=ADRSTG_015822.)  The arbitrator will be either a retired judge or an attorney licensed to practice law and will be selected by the parties from the AAA\u2019s roster of arbitrators.  If the parties are unable to agree upon an arbitrator within seven (7) days of delivery of the Demand for Arbitration, then the AAA will appoint the arbitrator in accordance with the AAA Rules.\nArbitration Location and Procedure.  Unless you and Academia.edu otherwise agree, the arbitration will be conducted in the county where you reside.  If your claim does not exceed $10,000, then the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of the documents that you and Academia.edu submit to the arbitrator, unless you request a hearing or the arbitrator determines that a hearing is necessary.  If your claim exceeds $10,000, your right to a hearing will be determined by the AAA Rules.  Subject to the AAA Rules, the arbitrator will have the discretion to direct a reasonable exchange of information by the parties, consistent with the expedited nature of the arbitration.\nArbitrator\u2019s Decision.  The arbitrator will render an award within the time frame specified in the AAA Rules.  The arbitrator\u2019s decision will include the essential findings and conclusions upon which the arbitrator based the award.  Judgment on the arbitration award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof.  The arbitrator\u2019s award damages must be consistent with the terms of the \u201cLimitation of Liability\u201d section above as to the types and the amounts of damages for which a party may be held liable.  The arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the claimant and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by the claimant\u2019s individual claim.  If you prevail in arbitration you will be entitled to an award of attorneys\u2019 fees and expenses, to the extent provided under applicable law.  Academia.edu will not seek, and hereby waives all rights it may have under applicable law to recover, attorneys\u2019 fees and expenses if it prevails in arbitration.\nFees.  Your responsibility to pay any AAA filing, administrative and arbitrator fees will be solely as set forth in the AAA Rules.  However, if your claim for damages does not exceed $75,000, Academia.edu will pay all such fees unless the arbitrator finds that either the substance of your claim or the relief sought in your Demand for Arbitration was frivolous or was brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)).\nChanges.  Notwithstanding the provisions of the \u201cModification\u201d section above, if Academia.edu changes this \u201cDispute Resolution\u201d section after the date you first accepted these Terms (or accepted any subsequent changes to these Terms), you may reject any such change by sending us written notice (including by email to feedback@academia.edu) within 30 days of the date such change became effective, as indicated in the \u201cLast Updated Date\u201d above or in the date of Academia.edu\u2019s email to you notifying you of such change.  By rejecting any change, you are agreeing that you will arbitrate any Dispute between you and Academia.edu in accordance with the provisions of this \u201cDispute Resolution\u201d section as of the date you first accepted these Terms (or accepted any subsequent changes to these Terms).\nGeneral\nThe failure of Academia.edu to enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not constitute a waiver of future enforcement of that right or provision. The waiver of any such right or provision will be effective only if in writing and signed by a duly authorized representative of Academia.edu. Except as expressly set forth in these Terms, the exercise by either party of any of its remedies under these Terms will be without prejudice to its other remedies under these Terms or otherwise. If for any reason a court of competent jurisdiction finds any provision of these Terms invalid or unenforceable, that provision will be enforced to the maximum extent permissible and the other provisions of these Terms will remain in full force and effect.\nContacting Academia.edu\nIf you have any questions about these Terms, please contact Academia.edu at feedback@academia.edu.\n\u00d7CloseLog InLog In\u00a0with\u00a0FacebookLog In\u00a0with\u00a0GoogleorEmail:Password:Remember me on this computeror\u00a0reset passwordEnter the email address you signed up with and we'll email you a reset link.\n"

For simplicity, we'll refer to any or all of this as the \"Service\".\nWhen you access or use the Service, you are agreeing to the following terms and conditions (\"Terms\") and acknowledge that they are a binding legal agreement between you and Delicious Media.\nBy accessing or using the Service on behalf of an organization, like a company, you are also agreeing to these Terms on behalf of that organization and saying that you are authorized to do that on behalf of your organization.\nOur goal is to provide a valuable and enjoyable service through which users can share and discover the \"tastiest\" web content. Please read all of these Terms, and the Delicious Privacy Policy to be sure you understand how it all works. Here are a few basic principles (more details on these are further down):\nWhat's yours is yours and vice versa. When you add content to the service you are NOT giving us ownership of what you added. Likewise, we are not giving you ownership of anything belonging to Delicious Media. You are giving us certain rights to use things you add to the Service as part of our operation of the Service and we are giving you the right to use the Service.\nContent you put on the Service may be public so consider carefully what you add and how you add it. The Delicious Privacy Policy gives you full details on what is public and what is private. Be good and play nicely. The Service is only provided for lawful purposes and not for engaging in or promoting illegal activity. Also, don't do things that would harm the Service or make it less enjoyable for others.\nWho Can Use Delicious?\nThe Service is intended solely for persons who are 13 or older. If you are not 13 or older, do not use the Service. If you use or access the Service you are telling us that you are 13 or older. You may use the Service only as allowed by these Terms and all applicable laws. If something you want to do on the Service violates the Terms or the law, don't do it.\nCan I connect the Service to my account on a social network like Twitter, Facebook or Linkedin?\nYes! We have enabled linking your Delicious account to other social networks and will be adding more over time. When you choose to create an account on the Service you will have the opportunity to register with and/or link the Service to certain other services on which you are a member, things like Twitter, Facebook and Linkedin. You may also choose to link to these services after creating your account. You do NOT need to register via another site or connect the Service to your other accounts, but if you do please be aware that you are authorizing us to access your account information on those other sites on your behalf. See the Delicious Privacy Policy for more details.\nWhat happens when I add something to the Service?\nWe'll use the term, \"User Content\" to mean anything and everything a user adds to the Service. The most common thing users will add are links they save, information about those links like tags or titles, and notes they add to those links. This information may be publicly available depending on the user's privacy selections. See the Delicious Privacy Policy for more details.\nYour User Content is yours and User Content added by others is theirs. By adding something to the Service you are not giving Delicious Media or anyone else ownership of that User Content.\nWhen you put User Content on the Service, you do give us (and our service providers, partners and other users) free and unlimited rights to use your User Content as part of the Service including as the Service may evolve in the future. This means we can use, including copying, modifying etc. what you put on the Service as part of running the Service worldwide and including things like enabling it on different devices and platforms. For example, this license allows us to make your public links and related information available to others as part of their use of the Service. This also means that other users of the Service can use your publicly available content as part of their use of the Service.\nYou are responsible for what you do on the Service.\nYou are responsible for your use of the Service and all of your User Content, we are not responsible or liable for any use of your User Content. Depending on your privacy settings, your User Content may be used by us, other users, and our partners. If you don't have the right to submit your User Content for such use, it may subject you to liability. When you add content to the Service you are representing that you have all the necessary rights to do so and to enable others to use the content as described in these Terms.\nCan I remove content I add to the Service?\nYes, you may remove your User Content from the Service at any time by specifically marking it for deletion or terminating your Account. If you choose to remove your User Content or to terminate your Account, your User Content will be removed from our systems in a commercially reasonable amount of time (e.g., time enough to allow our services to update), provided, however, we may retain an archived copy as required by law. In addition, in certain instances, copies of your User Content may continue to exist in published or recorded form when it has been retransmitted, redistributed, or otherwise licensed to others as contemplated in these Terms. For instance, once an RSS feed has been downloaded we do not have the ability to change that download; so, if you delete something after that RSS feed has been downloaded what you deleted will not be deleted from the downloaded copy. Likewise, to the extent that search engines or others archive pages it's possible your content will remain available through those search engines even though it's not available on the live version of our site (or even in any cached versions we maintain).\nShould I back-up my content?\nYes, and Delicious Media provides registered users with simple export options to do this. While we do not anticipate an event where a user's information would be lost, we cannot guarantee it will never happen. Therefore, it's your responsibility to back-up your User Content. You agree that Delicious Media is not responsible or liable for the deletion of, or the failure to store or to transmit any User Content. Users whose accounts have been terminated by Delicious Media as allowed in these Terms will need to contact Delicious Media directly if they wish to obtain a copy of the User Content they added. Delicious Media will consider such requests on a case by case basis and is under no obligation to grant such request or provide such information.\nWe are not Big Brother.\nDelicious Media has no obligation to monitor your access to or use of the Service or to review or edit any User Content you choose to add and we do not do so as part of our normal operations; however, Delicious Media has the right to do these things for the purpose of operating the Service, to ensure your compliance with these Terms and applicable laws. Delicious Media reserves the right, at any time and without prior notice, to remove or disable access to any content on the Service that Delicious Media, in its sole discretion, considers to be objectionable for any reason, in violation of these Terms or otherwise harmful to the Service.\nWe are also not your Mother, but we do want you to be careful when crossing the Internet.\nThe Service contains links to other websites that our users have shared. If you choose to click on a link and go to another site you may be exposed to content that is offensive, harmful, inaccurate or otherwise inappropriate. If you aren't sure a site is safe and inoffensive to you, don't click on the link. If you click a link and something bad happens when you visit another site we are not responsible or liable in any way. We're not responsible for the content of other sites and we're not responsible for links users share on the Service. Just because a user has shared a link does not mean it's safe and the fact that the link is on the Service does not mean we have checked it, endorsed it or otherwise determined it is ok for you to visit -- we have not. You assume all risk from visiting sites linked to on the Service.\nCopyrights and Trademarks: Don't Infringe Other People's Rights!\nDelicious Media respects copyright and trademark laws and expects its users to do the same. Delicious Media has adopted and implemented a policy that tells copyright owners how to notify us if they believe content on the Service infringes their rights. Please see the Delicious Copyright Policy for further information.\nWe have the right to and will terminate users' accounts if they repeatedly infringe or are believed to be repeatedly infringing other people's rights. We also reserve the right to require a user to change their username for any reason including infringement of someone's rights.\nBy the way, copyright and trademark laws also protect the Service and Delicious Media exclusively owns all rights to the Service except as expressly provided in these Terms. All trademarks, service marks, logos, trade names and any other proprietary designations of Delicious Media used herein are trademarks or registered trademarks of Delicious Media. Any other trademarks, service marks, logos, trade names and any other proprietary designations are the trademarks or registered trademarks of their respective parties.\nWhat not to Do\nMost of this should be pretty obvious, but here's a list just to make sure people are clear on some of the details of what it's not ok to do on the Service:\nDO NOT:\n---Post, submit or transmit any User Content that constitutes a direct, specific threat of violence against another;\n---Use the Service for an unlawful purpose or for promotion of illegal activities;\n---Impersonate others through the Service in a manner that does or is intended to mislead, confuse or deceive others;\n---Access, tamper with, or use non-public areas of the Service, Delicious Media's computer systems, or the technical delivery systems of Delicious Media's providers;\n---Attempt to probe, scan, or test the vulnerability of any Delicious Media system or network or breach any security or authentication measures;\n---Avoid, bypass, remove, deactivate, impair, descramble or otherwise circumvent any technological measure implemented by Delicious Media or any of Delicious Media's providers or any other third party (including another user) to protect the Service or any content on the Service;\n---Attempt to access or search the Service or any content on the service or download any content from the Service through the use of any engine, software, tool, agent, device or mechanism (including spiders, robots, crawlers, data mining tools or the like) other than the software and/or search agents provided by Delicious Media or other generally available third party web browsers;\n---Send any unsolicited or unauthorized advertising, promotional materials, email, junk mail, spam, chain letters or other form of solicitation;\n---Forge any TCP/IP packet header or any part of the header information in any email or newsgroup posting, or in any way use the Service to send altered, deceptive or false source-identifying information;\n---Interfere with, or attempt to interfere with, the access of any user, host or network, including, without limitation, sending a virus, intentionally linking to malicious content, overloading, flooding, spamming, or mail-bombing the Service;\n---Collect or store any personally identifiable information from the Service from other users of the Service without their express permission; or encourage or enable any other individual to do any of the foregoing.\nWhen it's Over\nIf you violate any of these Terms, your permission to use the Service may be suspended or permanently revoked. We reserve the right to suspend, disable or terminate your Account, in our sole discretion and without prior notice to you, with or without cause. You may cancel your Account at any time via the \"Settings\" section of your Account.\nGot Feedback?\nAny feedback, comments and suggestions for improvements to the Service that you submit to Delicious Media (\"Feedback\") will be the sole and exclusive property of Delicious Media and by submitting such Feedback you irrevocably assign to Delicious Media and agree to irrevocably assign to Delicious Media all of your rights in all such Feedback, including all related intellectual property rights. Your submission of any Feedback to Delicious Media is entirely voluntary and we will be free to use such Feedback as we choose and without any obligation to you.\nDelicious Bookmarklet\nIf you choose to install the Delicious Bookmarklet the following further terms and conditions also apply in addition to those above and below this \"Delicious Bookmarklet\" section:\nDelicious Bookmarklet License. Subject to your compliance with the terms and conditions of these Terms, Delicious Media grants you a limited, non-exclusive and non-transferable license to install and use the executable form of the Delicious Bookmarklet, without modification. Delicious Media reserves all rights in the Delicious Bookmarklet not expressly granted to you in these Terms.\nLicense Restrictions. Except as expressly specified these Terms, you may not: (i) copy, modify or distribute the Delicious Bookmarklet for any purpose; (ii) transfer, sublicense, lease, lend, rent or otherwise distribute the Delicious Bookmarklet to any third party; or (iii) use the Delicious Bookmarklet in any unlawful manner, for any unlawful purpose, or in any manner inconsistent with these Terms.\nUpdates and Upgrades; No Obligation. Delicious Media is not obligated to maintain or support the Delicious Bookmarklet, or to provide you with updates, upgrades or services related thereto. You acknowledge that Delicious Media may from time to time in its sole discretion issue updates or upgrades to the Delicious Bookmarklet, and may automatically update or upgrade the version of the Delicious Bookmarklet that you are using. You consent to such automatic updating or upgrading, and agree that the terms and conditions of these Terms will apply to all such updates or upgrades.\nTerm and Termination. The license to the Delicious Bookmarklet granted under these Terms remains in effect unless earlier terminated by you or Delicious Media in accordance with these Terms. You may terminate the license at any time by uninstalling all copies of the Delicious Bookmarklet in your possession or control. Without limiting any other terms of these Terms, the license will automatically terminate without notice from Delicious Media if you breach any terms of these Terms. Upon any termination of the bookmarklet license, you must cease all use of the Delicious Bookmarklet and promptly delete and destroy all copies, full or partial, of the Delicious Bookmarklet.\nThird Party Code. The Delicious Bookmarklet is distributed with certain independent code that is licensed under open source licenses (\"Open Source Code\") and the Open Source Code is licensed to you in accordance with the applicable open source licenses. To the extent that any of the terms and conditions of these Terms conflict with any such open source licenses, the conflicting terms and conditions will not apply to the corresponding Open Source Code.\nThe Service is Available \"AS-IS\"\nYour access to and use of the Service and any content available on or through the Service is at your own risk. You understand and agree that the Service and content available on or through the Service are provided to you on an \"AS-IS\" and \"AS-AVAILABLE\" basis. WITHOUT LIMITING THE FOREGOING, Delicious Media EXPLICITLY DISCLAIMS ANY WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, OR NON-INFRINGEMENT. We make no warranty (i) that the Service or any content available on or through the Service will meet your requirements or be available on an uninterrupted, secure, or error-free basis; or (ii) regarding the quality of any products, services or content or the accuracy, timeliness, truthfulness, completeness or reliability of any content obtained through the Service. No advice or information, whether oral or written, obtained from Delicious Media or through the Service will create any warranty not expressly made herein.\nLimitation of Liability\nYOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT, TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, NEITHER DELICIOUS MEDIA NOR ANY OTHER PARTY INVOLVED IN CREATING, PRODUCING, OR DELIVERING THE SERVICE WILL BE LIABLE FOR ANY DIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY OR CONSEQUENTIAL OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION, LOSS OF PROFITS, DATA, USE, GOODWILL, OR OTHER INTANGIBLE LOSSES, RESULTING FROM (I) YOUR ACCESS TO OR USE OF OR INABILITY TO ACCESS OR USE THE SERVICE; (II) ANY CONDUCT OR CONTENT OF ANY THIRD PARTY ON THE SERVICE, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY DEFAMATORY, OFFENSIVE OR ILLEGAL CONDUCT OF OTHER USERS OR THIRD PARTIES; (III) ANY CONTENT OBTAINED FROM OR THROUGH THE SERVICE; AND (IV) UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS, USE OR ALTERATION OF YOUR TRANSMISSIONS OR CONTENT, WHETHER BASED ON WARRANTY, CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), PRODUCT LIABILITY OR ANY OTHER LEGAL THEORY, AND WHETHER OR NOT Delicious Science HAS BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGE, EVEN IF A LIMITED REMEDY SET FORTH HEREIN IS FOUND TO HAVE FAILED OF ITS ESSENTIAL PURPOSE.\nIN NO EVENT WILL DELICIOUS MEDIA'S AGGREGATE LIABILITY ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THESE TERMS OR FROM THE USE OF OR INABILITY TO USE THE SERVICE OR ANY CONTENT AVAILABLE ON OR THROUGHT THE SERVICE EXCEED ONE DOLLAR ($1). THE LIMITATIONS OF DAMAGES SET FORTH ABOVE ARE FUNDAMENTAL ELEMENTS OF THE BASIS OF THE BARGAIN BETWEEN DELICIOUS MEDIA AND YOU. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF LIABILITY FOR CONSEQUENTIAL OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES, SO THE ABOVE LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.\nControlling Law and Jurisdiction\nThese Terms and any action related thereto will be governed by the laws of the State of California without regard to its conflict of laws provisions. The exclusive jurisdiction and venue of any action with respect to the subject matter of these Terms, including any claims arising from or related to the use of the Service or Service Content, will be the state and federal courts located in the Northern District of California and each of the parties hereto waives any objection to jurisdiction and venue in such courts.\nWe may make Modifications or Changes\nDelicious Media may, its sole discretion, choose to modify, discontinue or terminate the Service, at any time and without prior notice. Delicious Media may also choose to modify the Terms. If we choose to modify the Terms, we'll post them and your continued use of the Service will mean you agree to be bound by the new terms. If you don't agree then you need to stop using the Service.\nEntire Agreement\nThese Terms constitute the entire and exclusive understanding and agreement between Delicious Media and you regarding the Service and Service Content, and these Terms supersede and replace any and all prior oral or written understandings or agreements between Delicious Media and you regarding the Service and Service Content.\nAssignment\nYou may not assign or transfer these Terms, by operation of law or otherwise, without Delicious Media's prior written consent.

For notices made by e-mail or posting, the date of receipt will be deemed the date on which such notice is transmitted or posted, whichever is earlier. \nGeneral\nThe failure of Delicious Media to enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not constitute a waiver of future enforcement of that right or provision. The waiver of any such right or provision will be effective only if in writing and signed by a duly authorized representative of Delicious Media. Except as expressly set forth in these Terms, the exercise by either party of any of its remedies under these Terms will be without prejudice to its other remedies under these Terms or otherwise. If for any reason a court of competent jurisdiction finds any provision of these Terms invalid or unenforceable, that provision will be enforced to the maximum extent permissible and the other provisions of these Terms will remain in full force and effect.\n---About\n---Apps\n---Branding\n---Copyright\n---Help\n---Privacy\n---RSS\n---Terms\n---Tools\n"

In addition, you will be subject to late fees. eBay, or the collection agencies we retain, may also report information about your account to credit bureaus, and as a result, late payments, missed payments, or other defaults on your account may be reflected in your credit report.

You agree to comply with our returns policy.\nWhen an item is returned, to refund the buyer, you (as seller) authorize eBay to request that PayPal remove the refund amount (in same or other currency) from your PayPal account, place the amount on your invoice, and/or charge your payment method on file.\nThe cost of return shipping for an item that is not as described is the seller's responsibility.\nYou (as seller) authorize eBay to place the return shipping label cost on your invoice, subject to your automatic payment method on file when:\n---An eBay-generated return shipping label is used, and the seller is responsible for its cost;\n---Returns have been automated;\n---You fail to send your buyer a return shipping label and, instead, an eBay-generated shipping label is used; and/or\n---A transaction is cancelled, and to refund the buyer, you (as seller) authorize eBay to request that PayPal remove the refund amount (in same or other currency) from your PayPal account. See canceling a transaction for more details.\nOne of the ways that we may make eBay.com listings available to international buyers on eBay.com and on eBay's International Sites is through the Global Shipping Program. For eligible items located in the United States and purchased by an international buyer through the Global Shipping Program, you (as seller) will simply ship the item to a parcel processing facility located in the United States after receiving notification of payment from your buyer. Pitney Bowes Inc., a third-party global shipping provider, will oversee the processing, customs clearance, and international shipment of the item on behalf of your international buyer. To the extent a buyer has a question about your Global Shipping Program listings, eBay may respond directly to the buyer if the question pertains to the services overseen by Pitney Bowes Inc. (for example, customs or international shipping). You pay no additional fees for selling through the Global Shipping Program.\nPursuant to a routed export transaction under the U.S. Export Administration Regulations and Foreign Trade Regulations, your buyer, as the Foreign Principal Party in Interest, will agree to assume responsibility for the export shipment, with Pitney Bowes Inc. acting as your buyer's forwarding agent. You remain liable for the accuracy of information you provide about items, and you agree to provide timely responses to requests for additional information.\nYou consent to the disclosure of certain personally identifiable information, as well as listing and order information, by eBay to Pitney Bowes Inc., and by Pitney Bowes Inc. to its affiliates, service providers, and other third parties (such as customs and revenue authorities, as well as other government agencies), in connection with the processing, export and customs clearance, and international transportation of any item. eBay does not control the privacy policies of Pitney Bowes Inc., its affiliates, or its service providers, and you are subject to the privacy policies of those parties, as applicable.\nAdditional information about the program, including policies governing feedback, the handling of lost, damaged, and undeliverable items, returns, and the resolution of buyer protection claims for items that you sell through the program, can be found on our Global Shipping Program - opens in new window or tab and Global Shipping FAQs - opens in new window or tab pages.\nMost eBay sales go smoothly, but if there's a problem with a purchase, the eBay Money Back Guarantee helps buyers and sellers communicate and resolve issues. You agree to comply with the policy and permit us to make a final decision on any eBay Money Back Guarantee case.\nIf you (as seller), choose to reimburse a buyer, or are required to reimburse a buyer or eBay under the eBay Money Back Guarantee, you authorize eBay to request that PayPal remove the reimbursement amount (in same or other currency) from your PayPal account, place the amount on your invoice, and/or charge your payment method on file. If we cannot get reimbursement from you, we may collect the outstanding sums using other collection mechanisms, including retaining collection agencies.\nWe may suspend the eBay Money Back Guarantee in whole or in part without notice if we suspect abuse or interference with the proper working of the policy.\nWe try to keep our Services safe, secure, and functioning properly, but we cannot guarantee the continuous operation of or access to our Services. Bid update and other notification functionality in eBay's applications may not occur in real time. Such functionality is subject to delays beyond eBay's control.\nYou agree that you are making use of our Services at your own risk, and that they are being provided to you on an \"AS IS\" and \"AS AVAILABLE\" basis. Accordingly, to the extent permitted by applicable law, we exclude all express or implied warranties, terms and conditions including, but not limited to, implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and non-infringement.\nIn addition, to the extent permitted by applicable law, we (including our parent, subsidiaries, and affiliates, and our and their officers, directors, agents and employees) are not liable, and you agree not to hold us responsible, for any damages or losses (including, but not limited to, loss of money, goodwill or reputation, profits, other intangible losses, or any special, indirect, or consequential damages) resulting directly or indirectly from:\n---the content you provide (directly or indirectly) using the Services;\n---your use of or your inability to use our Services;\n---pricing, shipping, format, or other guidance provided by eBay;\n---delays or disruptions in our Services;\n---viruses or other malicious software obtained by accessing or linking to our Services;\n---glitches, bugs, errors, or inaccuracies of any kind in our Services;\n---damage to your hardware device from the use of any eBay Service;\n---the content, actions, or inactions of third parties, including items listed using our Services or the destruction of allegedly fake items;\n---a suspension or other action taken with respect to your account or breach of the Abusing eBay Section above;\n---the duration or manner in which your listings appear in search results as set out in the Listing Conditions Section above; or\n---your need to modify practices, content, or behavior, or your loss of or inability to do business, as a result of changes to this User Agreement or our policies.\nSome jurisdictions do not allow the disclaimer of warranties or exclusion of damages, so such disclaimers and exclusions may not apply to you.\nRegardless of the previous paragraphs, if we are found to be liable, our liability to you or to any third party is limited to the greater of (a) any amounts due under the eBay Money Back Guarantee up to the price the item sold for on eBay (including any applicable sales tax) and its original shipping costs, (b) the amount of fees in dispute not to exceed the total fees, which you paid to us in the 12 months prior to the action giving rise to the liability, or (c) $100.\nIf you have a dispute with one or more users, you release us (and our affiliates and subsidiaries, and our and their respective officers, directors, employees and agents) from claims, demands and damages (actual and consequential) of every kind and nature, known and unknown, arising out of or in any way connected with such disputes. In entering into this release you expressly waive any protections (whether statutory or otherwise) that would otherwise limit the coverage of this release to include only those claims which you may know or suspect to exist in your favor at the time of agreeing to this release.\nYou will indemnify and hold us (including our affiliates and subsidiaries, as well as our and their respective officers, directors, employees, agents) harmless from any claim or demand, including reasonable legal fees, made by any third party due to or arising out of your breach of this User Agreement, your improper use of eBay's Services or your breach of any law or the rights of a third party.\nPLEASE READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY. IT AFFECTS YOUR RIGHTS AND WILL HAVE A SUBSTANTIAL IMPACT ON HOW CLAIMS YOU AND EBAY HAVE AGAINST EACH OTHER ARE RESOLVED.\nYou and eBay agree that any claim or dispute at law or equity that has arisen, or may arise, between you and eBay (including any claim or dispute between you and a third-party agent of eBay) that relates in any way to or arises out of this or previous versions of this User Agreement, your use of or access to the Services, the actions of eBay or its agents, or any products or services sold or purchased through the Services, will be resolved in accordance with the provisions set forth in this Legal Disputes Section.\nYou agree that, except to the extent inconsistent with or preempted by federal law, the laws of the State of Utah, without regard to principles of conflict of laws, will govern this User Agreement and any claim or dispute that has arisen or may arise between you and eBay, except as otherwise stated in this User Agreement.\nYou and eBay each agree that any and all disputes or claims that have arisen, or may arise, between you and eBay (including any disputes or claims between you and a third-party agent of eBay) that relate in any way to or arise out of this or previous versions of the User Agreement, your use of or access to the Services, the actions of eBay or its agents, or any products or services sold, offered, or purchased through the Services shall be resolved exclusively through final and binding arbitration, rather than in court. Alternatively, you may assert your claims in small claims court, if your claims qualify and so long as the matter remains in such court and advances only on an individual (non-class, non-representative) basis. The Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this Agreement to Arbitrate.\n---Prohibition of Class and Representative Actions and Non-Individualized Relief\nYOU AND EBAY AGREE THAT EACH OF US MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS, OR REPRESENTATIVE OR PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL ACTION OR PROCEEDING. UNLESS BOTH YOU AND EBAY AGREE OTHERWISE, THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE OR JOIN MORE THAN ONE PERSON'S OR PARTY'S CLAIMS, AND MAY NOT OTHERWISE PRESIDE OVER ANY FORM OF A CONSOLIDATED, REPRESENTATIVE, CLASS, OR PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL ACTION OR PROCEEDING. ALSO, THE ARBITRATOR MAY AWARD RELIEF (INCLUDING MONETARY, INJUNCTIVE, AND DECLARATORY RELIEF) ONLY IN FAVOR OF THE INDIVIDUAL PARTY SEEKING RELIEF AND ONLY TO THE EXTENT NECESSARY TO PROVIDE RELIEF NECESSITATED BY THAT PARTY'S INDIVIDUAL CLAIM(S). ANY RELIEF AWARDED CANNOT AFFECT OTHER USERS. If a court decides that applicable law precludes enforcement of any of this paragraph's limitations as to a particular claim for relief, then that claim (and only that claim) must be severed from the arbitration and may be brought in court, subject to your and eBay's right to appeal the court's decision. All other claims will be arbitrated.\n---Arbitration Procedures\nArbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in court. Arbitration uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, and court review of an arbitration award is very limited. However, an arbitrator can award the same damages and relief on an individual basis that a court can award to an individual. An arbitrator should apply the terms of the User Agreement as a court would. All issues are for the arbitrator to decide, except that issues relating to arbitrability, the scope or enforceability of this Agreement to Arbitrate, or the interpretation of Section 1 of this Agreement to Arbitrate (\"Prohibition of Class and Representative Actions and Non-Individualized Relief\"), shall be for a court of competent jurisdiction to decide.\nThe arbitration will be conducted by the American Arbitration Association (\"AAA\") under its rules and procedures, including the AAA's Consumer Arbitration Rules (as applicable), as modified by this Agreement to Arbitrate. The AAA's rules are available at www.adr.org or by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879. The use of the word \"arbitrator\" in this provision shall not be construed to prohibit more than one arbitrator from presiding over an arbitration; rather, the AAA's rules will govern the number of arbitrators that may preside over an arbitration conducted under this Agreement to Arbitrate.\nA party who intends to seek arbitration must first send to the other, by certified mail, a completed form Notice of Dispute (\"Notice\"). You may download a form Notice - opens in new window or tab. The Notice to eBay should be sent to eBay Inc., Attn: Litigation Department, Re: Notice of Dispute, 583 W. eBay Way, Draper, UT 84020. eBay will send any Notice to you to the physical address we have on file associated with your eBay account; it is your responsibility to keep your physical address up to date. All information called for in the Notice must be provided, including a description of the nature and basis of the claims the party is asserting and the relief sought.\nIf you and eBay are unable to resolve the claims described in the Notice within 30 days after the Notice is sent, you or eBay may initiate arbitration proceedings. A form for initiating arbitration proceedings is available on the AAA's site at www.adr.org. In addition to filing this form with the AAA in accordance with its rules and procedures, the party initiating the arbitration must mail a copy of the completed form to the opposing party. You may send a copy to eBay at the following address: eBay, Inc. c/o CT Corporation System, 1108 E South Union Ave., Midvale, UT 84047. In the event eBay initiates an arbitration against you, it will send a copy of the completed form to the physical address we have on file associated with your eBay account. Any settlement offer made by you or eBay shall not be disclosed to the arbitrator.\nThe arbitration hearing shall be held in the county in which you reside or at another mutually agreed location. If the value of the relief sought is $10,000 or less, you or eBay may elect to have the arbitration conducted by telephone or based solely on written submissions, which election shall be binding on you and eBay subject to the arbitrator's discretion to require an in-person hearing, if the circumstances warrant. In cases where an in-person hearing is held, you and/or eBay may attend by telephone, unless the arbitrator requires otherwise.\nThe arbitrator will decide the substance of all claims in accordance with applicable law, including recognized principles of equity, and will honor all claims of privilege recognized by law. The arbitrator shall not be bound by rulings in prior arbitrations involving different users, but is bound by rulings in prior arbitrations involving the same eBay user to the extent required by applicable law. The arbitrator's award shall be final and binding and judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof.\n---Costs of Arbitration\nPayment of all filing, administration and arbitrator fees will be governed by the AAA's rules, unless otherwise stated in this Agreement to Arbitrate. If the value of the relief sought is $10,000 or less, at your request, eBay will pay all filing, administration, and arbitrator fees associated with the arbitration. Any request for payment of fees by eBay should be submitted by mail to the AAA along with your Demand for Arbitration and eBay will make arrangements to pay all necessary fees directly to the AAA. If (a) you willfully fail to comply with the Notice of Dispute requirement discussed above, or (b) in the event the arbitrator determines the claim(s) you assert in the arbitration to be frivolous, you agree to reimburse eBay for all fees associated with the arbitration paid by eBay on your behalf that you otherwise would be obligated to pay under the AAA's rules.\n---Severability\nWith the exception of any of the provisions in Section 1 of this Agreement to Arbitrate (\"Prohibition of Class and Representative Actions and Non-Individualized Relief\"), if an arbitrator or court decides that any part of this Agreement to Arbitrate is invalid or unenforceable, the other parts of this Agreement to Arbitrate shall still apply.\n---Opt-Out Procedure\nIF YOU ARE A NEW USER OF OUR SERVICES, YOU CAN CHOOSE TO REJECT THIS AGREEMENT TO ARBITRATE (\"OPT-OUT\") BY MAILING US A WRITTEN OPT-OUT NOTICE (\"OPT-OUT NOTICE\"). THE OPT-OUT NOTICE MUST BE POSTMARKED NO LATER THAN 30 DAYS AFTER THE DATE YOU ACCEPT THE USER AGREEMENT FOR THE FIRST TIME.

Opting out of this Agreement to Arbitrate has no effect on any previous, other, or future arbitration agreements that you may have with us.\n---Future Amendments to the Agreement to Arbitrate\nNotwithstanding any provision in the User Agreement to the contrary, you and we agree that if we make any amendment to this Agreement to Arbitrate (other than an amendment to any notice address or site link provided herein) in the future, that amendment shall not apply to any claim that was filed in a legal proceeding against eBay prior to the effective date of the amendment. The amendment shall apply to all other disputes or claims governed by the Agreement to Arbitrate that have arisen or may arise between you and eBay.

You and eBay agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of the courts located within Salt Lake County, Utah for the purpose of litigating all such claims or disputes.\nExcept as otherwise provided in this User Agreement, if any provision of this User Agreement is held to be invalid, void or for any reason unenforceable, such provision shall be struck out and shall not affect the validity and enforceability of the remaining provisions. In our sole discretion, we may assign this User Agreement, and in such event, we will post notice on www.ebay.com - opens in new window or tab.\nHeadings are for reference purposes only and do not limit the scope or extent of such Section. Our failure to act with respect to a breach by you or others does not waive our right to act with respect to subsequent or similar breaches. We do not guarantee we will take action against all breaches of this User Agreement.\nWe may amend this User Agreement at any time by posting the amended terms on www.eBay.com. Our right to amend the User Agreement includes the right to modify, add to, or remove terms in the User Agreement. We will provide you 30 days' notice by posting the amended terms.

The actual contract for sale is directly between the seller and buyer. eBay is not a traditional auctioneer.\nWhile we may provide pricing, shipping, listing, sourcing, and other guidance in our Services, such guidance is solely informational and you may decide to follow it or not. Also, while we may help facilitate the resolution of disputes through various programs, eBay has no control over and does not guarantee: the existence, quality, safety or legality of items advertised; the truth or accuracy of users' content or listings; the ability of sellers to sell items; the ability of buyers to pay for items; or that a buyer or seller will actually complete a transaction or return an item.\nIn connection with using or accessing the Services you will not:\n---post, list or upload content or items in inappropriate categories or areas on our sites;\n---breach or circumvent any laws, third-party rights or our systems, policies, or determinations of your account status;\n---use our Services if you are not able to form legally binding contracts (for example, if you are under 18 years old), or are temporarily or indefinitely suspended from using our sites, services, applications or tools;\n---fail to pay for items purchased by you, unless you have a valid reason as set out in an eBay policy, for example, the seller has materially changed the item's description after you bid, a clear typographical error is made, or you cannot contact the seller (see our Unpaid item policy);\n---fail to deliver items sold by you, unless you have a valid reason as set out in an eBay policy, for example, the buyer fails to comply with the posted terms in your listing or you cannot contact the buyer;\n---manipulate the price of any item or interfere with any other user's listings;\n---post false, inaccurate, misleading, deceptive, defamatory, or libelous content;\n---take any action that may undermine the feedback or ratings systems (see All about our Feedback policies);\n---transfer your eBay account (including Feedback) and user ID to another party without our consent;\n---distribute or post spam, unsolicited or bulk electronic communications, chain letters, or pyramid schemes;\n---distribute viruses or any other technologies that may harm eBay or the interests or property of users;\n---use any robot, spider, scraper, data mining tools, data gathering and extraction tools, or other automated means to access our Services for any purpose, except with the prior express permission of eBay;\n---interfere with the working of our Services, or impose an unreasonable or disproportionately large load on our infrastructure;\n---export or re-export any eBay application or tool, except in compliance with the export control laws of any relevant jurisdictions and in accordance with posted rules and restrictions;\n---infringe the copyright, trademark, patent, publicity, moral, database, and/or other intellectual property rights (collectively, \"Intellectual Property Rights\") that belong to or are licensed to eBay.

This may result in PayPal restricting funds in your PayPal account.\neBay may contact you using autodialed or prerecorded calls and text messages, at any telephone number that you have provided us, to: (i) notify you regarding your account; (ii) troubleshoot problems with your account; (iii) resolve a dispute; (iv) collect a debt; (v) poll your opinions through surveys or questionnaires; or (vi) as otherwise necessary to service your account or enforce this User Agreement, our policies, applicable law, or any other agreement we may have with you. eBay may also contact you using autodialed or prerecorded calls and text messages for marketing purposes (e.g., offers and promotions), if you consent to such communications. Our collection, use, disclosure, retention, and protection of your personal information is governed by the User Privacy Notice. As described in our User Privacy Notice, eBay may collect other telephone numbers for you and may place manual non-marketing calls to any of those numbers and autodialed non-marketing calls to any landline.

For all new sellers, in listings where returns are accepted, eBay will set a default rule that automates the return process. Sellers may remove or customize their return preferences in their account settings within My eBay. Where settings have been set to automatically accept requests for returns or replacements, an eBay-generated return shipping label will be provided to your buyer. You agree to comply with our returns policy.\n\tWhen an item is returned, to refund the buyer, you (as seller) authorize eBay to request that PayPal remove the refund amount (in same or other currency) from your PayPal account, place the amount on your invoice, and/or charge your payment method on file.\n\tThe cost of return shipping for an item that is not as described is the seller's responsibility.\n\tYou (as seller) authorize eBay to place the return shipping label cost on your invoice, subject to your automatic payment method on file when:\n\t\nAn eBay-generated return shipping label is used, and the seller is responsible for its cost;\nReturns have been automated;\nYou fail to send your buyer a return shipping label and, instead, an eBay-generated shipping label is used; and/or\nA transaction is cancelled, and to refund the buyer, you (as seller) authorize eBay to request that PayPal remove the refund amount (in same or other currency) from your PayPal account. See Canceling a transaction for more details.\n---Global Shipping Program\n\tOne of the ways that we may make eBay.com listings available to international buyers on eBay.com and on eBay's International Sites is through the Global Shipping Program. For eligible items located in the United States and purchased by an international buyer through the Global Shipping Program, you (as seller) will simply ship the item to a parcel processing facility located in the United States after receiving notification of payment from your buyer. Pitney Bowes Inc., a third-party global shipping provider, will oversee the processing, customs clearance, and international shipment of the item on behalf of your international buyer. To the extent a buyer has a question about your Global Shipping Program listings, eBay may respond directly to the buyer if the question pertains to the services overseen by Pitney Bowes Inc. (for example, customs or international shipping). You pay no additional fees for selling through the Global Shipping Program.\n\tPursuant to a routed export transaction under the U.S. Export Administration Regulations and Foreign Trade Regulations, your buyer, as the Foreign Principal Party in Interest, will agree to assume responsibility for the export shipment, with Pitney Bowes Inc. acting as your buyer's forwarding agent. You remain liable for the accuracy of information you provide about items, and you agree to provide timely responses to requests for additional information.\n\tYou consent to the disclosure of certain personally identifiable information, as well as listing and order information, by eBay to Pitney Bowes Inc., and by Pitney Bowes Inc. to its affiliates, service providers, and other third parties (such as customs and revenue authorities, as well as other government agencies), in connection with the processing, export and customs clearance, and international transportation of any item. eBay does not control the privacy policies of Pitney Bowes Inc., its affiliates, or its service providers, and you are subject to the privacy policies of those parties, as applicable.\n\tAdditional information about the program, including policies governing feedback, the handling of lost, damaged, and undeliverable items, returns, and the resolution of buyer protection claims for items that you sell through the program, can be found on our Global Shipping Program - opens in new window or tab and Global Shipping FAQs - opens in new window or tab pages.\n---eBay Money Back Guarantee\n\tMost eBay sales go smoothly, but if there's a problem with a purchase, the eBay Money Back Guarantee helps buyers and sellers communicate and resolve issues. You agree to comply with the policy and permit us to make a final decision on any eBay Money Back Guarantee case.\n\tIf you (as seller), choose to reimburse a buyer, or are required to reimburse a buyer or eBay under the eBay Money Back Guarantee, you authorize eBay to request that PayPal remove the reimbursement amount (in same or other currency) from your PayPal account, place the amount on your invoice, and/or charge your payment method on file. If we cannot get reimbursement from you, we may collect the outstanding sums using other collection mechanisms, including retaining collection agencies.\n\tWe may suspend the eBay Money Back Guarantee in whole or in part without notice if we suspect abuse or interference with the proper working of the policy.\nWe try to keep our Services safe, secure, and functioning properly, but we cannot guarantee the continuous operation of or access to our Services. Bid update and other notification functionality in eBay's applications may not occur in real time. Such functionality is subject to delays beyond eBay's control.\nYou agree that you are making use of our Services at your own risk, and that they are being provided to you on an \"AS IS\" and \"AS AVAILABLE\" basis. Accordingly, to the extent permitted by applicable law, we exclude all express or implied warranties, terms and conditions including, but not limited to, implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and non-infringement.\nIn addition, to the extent permitted by applicable law, we (including our parent, subsidiaries, and affiliates, and our and their officers, directors, agents and employees) are not liable, and you agree not to hold us responsible, for any damages or losses (including, but not limited to, loss of money, goodwill or reputation, profits, other intangible losses, or any special, indirect, or consequential damages) resulting directly or indirectly from:\n---the content you provide (directly or indirectly) using the Services;\n---your use of or your inability to use our Services;\n---pricing, shipping, format, or other guidance provided by eBay;\n---delays or disruptions in our Services;\n---viruses or other malicious software obtained by accessing or linking to our Services;\n---glitches, bugs, errors, or inaccuracies of any kind in our Services;\n---damage to your hardware device from the use of any eBay Service;\n---the content, actions, or inactions of third parties, including items listed using our Services or the destruction of allegedly fake items;\n---a suspension or other action taken with respect to your account or breach of the Abusing eBay Section above;\n---the duration or manner in which your listings appear in search results as set out in the Listing Conditions Section above; or\n---your need to modify practices, content, or behavior, or your loss of or inability to do business, as a result of changes to this User Agreement or our policies.\nSome jurisdictions do not allow the disclaimer of warranties or exclusion of damages, so such disclaimers and exclusions may not apply to you.\nRegardless of the previous paragraphs, if we are found to be liable, our liability to you or to any third party is limited to the greater of (a) any amounts due under the eBay Money Back Guarantee up to the price the item sold for on eBay (including any applicable sales tax) and its original shipping costs, (b) the amount of fees in dispute not to exceed the total fees, which you paid to us in the 12 months prior to the action giving rise to the liability, or (c) $100.\nIf you have a dispute with one or more users, you release us (and our affiliates and subsidiaries, and our and their respective officers, directors, employees and agents) from claims, demands and damages (actual and consequential) of every kind and nature, known and unknown, arising out of or in any way connected with such disputes.

IT AFFECTS YOUR RIGHTS AND WILL HAVE A SUBSTANTIAL IMPACT ON HOW CLAIMS YOU AND EBAY HAVE AGAINST EACH OTHER ARE RESOLVED.\nYou and eBay agree that any claim or dispute at law or equity that has arisen, or may arise, between you and eBay (including any claim or dispute between you and a third-party agent of eBay) that relates in any way to or arises out of this or previous versions of this User Agreement, your use of or access to the Services, the actions of eBay or its agents, or any products or services sold or purchased through the Services, will be resolved in accordance with the provisions set forth in this Legal Disputes Section.\nA. Applicable Law\nYou agree that, except to the extent inconsistent with or preempted by federal law, the laws of the State of Utah, without regard to principles of conflict of laws, will govern this User Agreement and any claim or dispute that has arisen or may arise between you and eBay, except as otherwise stated in this User Agreement.\nB. Agreement to Arbitrate\nYou and eBay each agree that any and all disputes or claims that have arisen, or may arise, between you and eBay (including any disputes or claims between you and a third-party agent of eBay) that relate in any way to or arise out of this or previous versions of the User Agreement, your use of or access to the Services, the actions of eBay or its agents, or any products or services sold, offered, or purchased through the Services shall be resolved exclusively through final and binding arbitration, rather than in court. Alternatively, you may assert your claims in small claims court, if your claims qualify and so long as the matter remains in such court and advances only on an individual (non-class, non-representative) basis. The Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this Agreement to Arbitrate.\n---Prohibition of Class and Representative Actions and Non-Individualized Relief\nYOU AND EBAY AGREE THAT EACH OF US MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS, OR REPRESENTATIVE OR PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL ACTION OR PROCEEDING. UNLESS BOTH YOU AND EBAY AGREE OTHERWISE, THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE OR JOIN MORE THAN ONE PERSON'S OR PARTY'S CLAIMS, AND MAY NOT OTHERWISE PRESIDE OVER ANY FORM OF A CONSOLIDATED, REPRESENTATIVE, CLASS, OR PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL ACTION OR PROCEEDING. ALSO, THE ARBITRATOR MAY AWARD RELIEF (INCLUDING MONETARY, INJUNCTIVE, AND DECLARATORY RELIEF) ONLY IN FAVOR OF THE INDIVIDUAL PARTY SEEKING RELIEF AND ONLY TO THE EXTENT NECESSARY TO PROVIDE RELIEF NECESSITATED BY THAT PARTY'S INDIVIDUAL CLAIM(S). ANY RELIEF AWARDED CANNOT AFFECT OTHER USERS. If a court decides that applicable law precludes enforcement of any of this paragraph's limitations as to a particular claim for relief, then that claim (and only that claim) must be severed from the arbitration and may be brought in court, subject to your and eBay's right to appeal the court's decision. All other claims will be arbitrated.\n---Arbitration Procedures\nArbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in court. Arbitration uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, and court review of an arbitration award is very limited. However, an arbitrator can award the same damages and relief on an individual basis that a court can award to an individual. An arbitrator should apply the terms of the User Agreement as a court would. All issues are for the arbitrator to decide, except that issues relating to arbitrability, the scope or enforceability of this Agreement to Arbitrate, or the interpretation of Section 1 of this Agreement to Arbitrate (\"Prohibition of Class and Representative Actions and Non-Individualized Relief\"), shall be for a court of competent jurisdiction to decide.\nThe arbitration will be conducted by the American Arbitration Association (\"AAA\") under its rules and procedures, including the AAA's Consumer Arbitration Rules (as applicable), as modified by this Agreement to Arbitrate. The AAA's rules are available at www.adr.org or by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879. The use of the word \"arbitrator\" in this provision shall not be construed to prohibit more than one arbitrator from presiding over an arbitration; rather, the AAA's rules will govern the number of arbitrators that may preside over an arbitration conducted under this Agreement to Arbitrate.\nA party who intends to seek arbitration must first send to the other, by certified mail, a completed form Notice of Dispute (\"Notice\"). You may download a form Notice - opens in new window or tab. The Notice to eBay should be sent to eBay Inc., Attn: Litigation Department, Re: Notice of Dispute, 583 W. eBay Way, Draper, UT 84020. eBay will send any Notice to you to the physical address we have on file associated with your eBay account; it is your responsibility to keep your physical address up to date. All information called for in the Notice must be provided, including a description of the nature and basis of the claims the party is asserting and the relief sought.\nIf you and eBay are unable to resolve the claims described in the Notice within 30 days after the Notice is sent, you or eBay may initiate arbitration proceedings. A form for initiating arbitration proceedings is available on the AAA's site at www.adr.org. In addition to filing this form with the AAA in accordance with its rules and procedures, the party initiating the arbitration must mail a copy of the completed form to the opposing party. You may send a copy to eBay at the following address: eBay, Inc. c/o CT Corporation System, 1108 E South Union Ave., Midvale, UT 84047. In the event eBay initiates an arbitration against you, it will send a copy of the completed form to the physical address we have on file associated with your eBay account. Any settlement offer made by you or eBay shall not be disclosed to the arbitrator.\nThe arbitration hearing shall be held in the county in which you reside or at another mutually agreed location. If the value of the relief sought is $10,000 or less, you or eBay may elect to have the arbitration conducted by telephone or based solely on written submissions, which election shall be binding on you and eBay subject to the arbitrator's discretion to require an in-person hearing, if the circumstances warrant. In cases where an in-person hearing is held, you and/or eBay may attend by telephone, unless the arbitrator requires otherwise.\nThe arbitrator will decide the substance of all claims in accordance with applicable law, including recognized principles of equity, and will honor all claims of privilege recognized by law. The arbitrator shall not be bound by rulings in prior arbitrations involving different users, but is bound by rulings in prior arbitrations involving the same eBay user to the extent required by applicable law. The arbitrator's award shall be final and binding and judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof.\n---Costs of Arbitration\nPayment of all filing, administration and arbitrator fees will be governed by the AAA's rules, unless otherwise stated in this Agreement to Arbitrate. If the value of the relief sought is $10,000 or less, at your request, eBay will pay all filing, administration, and arbitrator fees associated with the arbitration. Any request for payment of fees by eBay should be submitted by mail to the AAA along with your Demand for Arbitration and eBay will make arrangements to pay all necessary fees directly to the AAA. If (a) you willfully fail to comply with the Notice of Dispute requirement discussed above, or (b) in the event the arbitrator determines the claim(s) you assert in the arbitration to be frivolous, you agree to reimburse eBay for all fees associated with the arbitration paid by eBay on your behalf that you otherwise would be obligated to pay under the AAA's rules.\n---Severability\nWith the exception of any of the provisions in Section 1 of this Agreement to Arbitrate (\"Prohibition of Class and Representative Actions and Non-Individualized Relief\"), if an arbitrator or court decides that any part of this Agreement to Arbitrate is invalid or unenforceable, the other parts of this Agreement to Arbitrate shall still apply.\n---Opt-Out Procedure\nIF YOU ARE A NEW USER OF OUR SERVICES, YOU CAN CHOOSE TO REJECT THIS AGREEMENT TO ARBITRATE (\"OPT-OUT\") BY MAILING US A WRITTEN OPT-OUT NOTICE (\"OPT-OUT NOTICE\"). THE OPT-OUT NOTICE MUST BE POSTMARKED NO LATER THAN 30 DAYS AFTER THE DATE YOU ACCEPT THE USER AGREEMENT FOR THE FIRST TIME. YOU MUST MAIL THE OPT-OUT NOTICE TO EBAY INC., ATTN: LITIGATION DEPARTMENT, RE: OPT-OUT NOTICE, 583 WEST EBAY WAY, DRAPER, UT 84020.\nFor your convenience, we are providing an Opt-Out Notice form - opens in new window or tab.

If you opt out of the Agreement to Arbitrate, all other parts of this User Agreement and its Legal Disputes Section will continue to apply to you. Opting out of this Agreement to Arbitrate has no effect on any previous, other, or future arbitration agreements that you may have with us.\n---Future Amendments to the Agreement to Arbitrate\nNotwithstanding any provision in the User Agreement to the contrary, you and we agree that if we make any amendment to this Agreement to Arbitrate (other than an amendment to any notice address or site link provided herein) in the future, that amendment shall not apply to any claim that was filed in a legal proceeding against eBay prior to the effective date of the amendment. The amendment shall apply to all other disputes or claims governed by the Agreement to Arbitrate that have arisen or may arise between you and eBay. We will notify you of amendments to this Agreement to Arbitrate by posting the amended terms on www.eBay.com at least 30 days before the effective date of the amendments and by providing notice through the eBay Message Center and/or by email. If you do not agree to these amended terms, you may close your account within the 30-day period and you will not be bound by the amended terms.\nC. Judicial Forum for Legal Disputes\nUnless you and we agree otherwise, in the event that the Agreement to Arbitrate above is found not to apply to you or to a particular claim or dispute, either as a result of your decision to opt out of the Agreement to Arbitrate or as a result of a decision by the arbitrator or a court order, you agree that any claim or dispute that has arisen or may arise between you and eBay must be resolved exclusively by a state or federal court located in Salt Lake County, Utah. You and eBay agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of the courts located within Salt Lake County, Utah for the purpose of litigating all such claims or disputes.\nExcept as otherwise provided in this User Agreement, if any provision of this User Agreement is held to be invalid, void or for any reason unenforceable, such provision shall be struck out and shall not affect the validity and enforceability of the remaining provisions. In our sole discretion, we may assign this User Agreement, and in such event, we will post notice on www.ebay.com - opens in new window or tab.\nHeadings are for reference purposes only and do not limit the scope or extent of such Section. Our failure to act with respect to a breach by you or others does not waive our right to act with respect to subsequent or similar breaches. We do not guarantee we will take action against all breaches of this User Agreement.\nWe may amend this User Agreement at any time by posting the amended terms on www.eBay.com. Our right to amend the User Agreement includes the right to modify, add to, or remove terms in the User Agreement. We will provide you 30 days' notice by posting the amended terms. Additionally, we will notify you through the eBay Message Center and/or by email. Your continued access or use of our Services constitutes your acceptance of the amended terms. We may also ask you to acknowledge your acceptance of the User Agreement through an electronic click-through. This User Agreement may not otherwise be amended except through mutual agreement by you and an eBay representative who intends to amend this User Agreement and is duly authorized to agree to such an amendment.\nThe policies and terms posted on our Services may be changed from time to time. Changes take effect when we post them on the eBay Service.\nIf you create or use an account on behalf of a business entity, you represent that you are authorized to act on behalf of such business and bind the business to this User Agreement. Such account is owned and controlled by the business entity. No agency, partnership, joint venture, employee-employer or franchiser-franchisee relationship is intended or created by this User Agreement.\nThe User Agreement and all terms and polices posted through our Services set forth the entire understanding and agreement between you and eBay, and supersede all prior understandings and agreements of the parties.\nThe following Sections survive any termination of this User Agreement: Fees, Content, Disclaimer of Warranties; Limitation of Liability; Release, Indemnity, Legal Disputes, and General.\nIf you are a California resident, in accordance with Cal.

Unless otherwise specified in the additional terms that apply to the Services you are using, the terms in this Section 11 apply to you.\r\n\t\nWe offer products and subscriptions for a fee (\u201cfee-based Services\u201d). These fee-based Services are governed by the additional terms you agree to when you register for the fee-based Service and these Terms. If you register for a fee-based Service, you must designate a payment method and provide us with accurate billing and payment information and you have the continuing obligation to keep it up to date. Many fee-based Services require you to have, or register for, a Yahoo or AOL or other Oath ID. If you are an AOL Dial-Up customer, please find additional terms here.\nThe following important provisions apply to all of our fee-based services:\r\n\t\t\nThird-Party products. If the fee-based Service includes a third-party product, you understand and agree that your purchase and use of the Service is also subject to the third party\u2019s terms of service and privacy policy, which you should read thoroughly before agreeing to them.\nPayments. You represent that you are at least the minimum age required to enter into a legal agreement. You agree to pay us for any fee-based Services you purchase from us, as well as all other charges incurred under your account, including applicable taxes and fees. You are responsible for all charges incurred under your account, including purchases made by you or anyone you allow to use your account or any sub-or linked accounts (including any person with implied, actual, or apparent authority) or anyone who gains access to your account as a result of your failure to safeguard your authentication credentials.\nPayment Methods. You authorize and direct us to charge your designated payment method for these charges or, if it fails, to charge any other payment method you have on file with us, even if we received it in association with other fee-based services. You are responsible for all charges even if your payment method fails or is denied. You authorize and direct us to retain all information about any payment method(s) associated with your account. We may import payment information you entered during a prior purchase and provide you the option to use that payment information during purchase of a new product. You permit us to obtain and use updated information from the issuer of your payment method in accordance with the policies and procedures of any applicable card brands. We may in some instances continue charging a payment method past its expiration date at our discretion and subject to the payment processors' or issuing bank's approval. Surcharges may apply if you use certain payment methods, such as payment from your checking or savings account.\nPayment Terms. We may charge for fee-based Services in advance and on a daily, monthly, yearly, lump sum, or other basis in accordance with the stated terms, as long as your subscription remains active, even if you have not downloaded or used the Service or accessed your online account.\nAuto-Renewal. We use auto-renewal for many of our fee-based Services. At the expiration of each subscription term for such fee-based Services, we will automatically renew your subscription and charge the credit card or other payment method you have provided to us, unless you cancel your subscription at least 48 hours before the end of the current period. Unless otherwise stated in Section 14, your subscription will be automatically renewed at the then-current price, excluding promotional and discount pricing.

Unless otherwise stated and unless you cancel your subscription prior to the expiration of the Free Trial, periodic subscription fees will be charged at the then-applicable rate upon expiration of the Free Trial period and will continue to be charged until the subscription is canceled. If you are not satisfied with a particular fee-based Service, you must cancel the subscription before the Free Trial ends to avoid charges. We reserve the right to limit you to one free trial or promotion of a fee-based Service and to prohibit the combining of free trials or other promotional offers.\nNo Refunds. All charges are nonrefundable unless provided otherwise in the terms you agree to when you register for a fee-based Service, unless stated differently for your country in Section 15 or as otherwise specified below.\nTermination. We, in our sole discretion, may change, discontinue or terminate any or all aspects of a fee-based Service without notice, including access to support services, content and other products or services ancillary to the fee-based Service, subject to providing an appropriate refund for any portions of a specified but no longer available term.

After 30 days from the date of any unpaid charges, your fee-based Service will be deemed delinquent and we may terminate or suspend your account and fee-based Service for nonpayment. You are liable for any fees, including attorney and collection fees, incurred by us in our efforts to collect any remaining balances from you.\n90-Day Notice Period.

Unless we indicate otherwise, modifications will be effective as of the date they are posted on this page or any successor page. You should look at the Terms regularly. We will provide notice (in accordance with Section 3(c) above) of material modifications.\nContinued Use of the Services. You may stop using the Services at any time, but your continued use of or subscription to a Service after the effective date of any modifications to the Terms or the means that you agree to the Terms as modified.\nWaiver and Severability of Terms. The failure of Oath to exercise or enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not constitute a waiver of such right or provision. If any provision (or part of a provision) of these Terms is found to be invalid, Oath and you nevertheless agree to give effect to the intentions as reflected in the provision, and the other provisions of these Terms remain in full force and effect.\nAssignment by Oath.

YOU AND OATH BOTH AGREE TO RESOLVE ANY AND ALL DISPUTES, CONTROVERSIES OR CLAIMS THAT IN ANY WAY ARISE OUT OF OR RELATE TO THESE TERMS OR FROM ANY SERVICES YOU RECEIVE FROM US (OR FROM ANY ADVERTISING FOR ANY SUCH SERVICES), INCLUDING ANY DISPUTES BETWEEN YOU AND OUR EMPLOYEES OR AGENTS (\u201cDISPUTE(S)\u201d), ONLY BY ARBITRATION ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS OR IN SMALL CLAIMS COURT. YOU UNDERSTAND THAT BY AGREEING TO THESE TERMS, ARBITRATION OR A SMALL CLAIMS ACTION WILL BE THE SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE MEANS OF RESOLVING ANY DISPUTE BETWEEN US. YOU ALSO UNDERSTAND THAT BY AGREEING TO THESE TERMS, YOU AND OATH ARE GIVING UP THE RIGHT TO BRING A CLAIM IN COURT OR IN FRONT OF A JURY (EXCEPT FOR MATTERS THAT MAY BE BROUGHT IN SMALL CLAIMS COURT), AND THAT YOU AND OATH ARE GIVING UP THE RIGHT TO PROCEED WITH ANY CLASS ACTION OR OTHER REPRESENTATIVE ACTION. WHILE ARBITRATION PROCEDURES MAY BE DIFFERENT THAN COURT PROCEDURES, AN ARBITRATOR CAN AWARD YOU INDIVIDUALLY THE SAME DAMAGES AND RELIEF AS A COURT, AND JUDGMENT ON THE AWARD RENDERED BY THE ARBITRATOR MAY BE ENTERED AND ENFORCED IN ANY COURT HAVING JURISDICTION THEREOF. THE PARTIES UNDERSTAND THAT ABSENT THIS MANDATORY PROVISION, THEY WOULD HAVE THE RIGHT TO SUE IN COURT AND HAVE A JURY TRIAL. THEY FURTHER UNDERSTAND THAT, IN SOME INSTANCES, THE COSTS OF ARBITRATION COULD EXCEED THE COSTS OF LITIGATION AND THE RIGHT TO DISCOVERY MAY BE MORE LIMITED IN ARBITRATION THAN IN COURT. We also both agree that:\nNotice of Dispute. If either you or Oath intends to arbitrate under these Terms, the party seeking arbitration must first notify the other party of the Dispute in writing at least 30 days in advance of initiating the arbitration. Notice to Oath should be sent to Oath either by mail to Oath, Attn: Disputes, 701 First Avenue, Sunnyvale, CA 94089; or disputes@oath.com. Notice to you will be to your email address(es) and street address(es), if any, that Oath has in its records at the time the notice is sent. The notice must describe the nature of the claim and the relief being sought. If we are unable to resolve the Dispute within 30 days, either party may then proceed to file a claim for arbitration.\nArbitration Procedure. The Federal Arbitration Act applies to these Terms. Except for small claims court cases, any and all Disputes will be resolved by arbitration administered by the American Arbitration Association (\"AAA\"). The AAA will apply the Commercial Arbitration Rules to the arbitration of any Dispute pursuant to these Terms, unless you are an individual and use the Services for personal or household use, in which case the AAA's Consumer Arbitration Rules will apply (excluding any rules or procedures governing or permitting class actions). You can get procedures (including the process for beginning an arbitration), rules and fee information from the AAA (www.adr.org). These Terms govern to the extent they conflict with the AAA\u2019s Commercial Arbitration Rules or Consumer Arbitration Rules.\nSmall Claims Court Option. As an alternative to arbitration, you may bring an individual action in small claims court in your county of residence (or if a business, your principal place of business) or Santa Clara County, California provided that your Dispute meets the requirements of the small claims court.\nArbitration Location. Unless you and Oath agree otherwise, the arbitration must take place, or the small claims action must be filed, in the county of your primary residence or Santa Clara County, California.\nArbitration Fees and Expenses. We will reimburse any filing fee that the AAA charges you for arbitration of the Dispute. If you provide us with signed written notice that you cannot pay the filing fee, we will pay the fee directly to the AAA. If the arbitration proceeds, we will also pay any administrative and arbitrator fees charged later.\nSettlement Offers. We may, but are not obligated to, make a written settlement offer anytime before or during arbitration. The amount or terms of any settlement offer may not be disclosed to the arbitrator unless and until the arbitrator issues an award on the claim. If you do not accept the offer and the arbitrator awards you an amount of money that is more than our offer but less than $5,000, we agree to: (a) pay you $5,000 instead of the lower amount awarded, (b) pay your reasonable attorney\u2019s fees and costs, and (c) reimburse any arbitration filing fees and arbitrator fees and expenses incurred in connection with the arbitration of your Dispute. If the arbitrator awards you more than $5,000 and we are not challenging the award, then we will pay you the amount of the award.\nSeverability. If any part of this agreement to arbitrate is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be unenforceable, the court will reform the agreement to the extent necessary to cure the unenforceable part(s), and the parties will arbitrate their Dispute(s) without reference to or reliance upon the unenforceable part(s). However, if for any reason the Class Action Waiver set forth below in subsection 14.2.c cannot be enforced as to some or all of the Dispute, then the agreement to arbitrate will not apply to that Dispute or portion thereof. Any Disputes covered by any deemed unenforceable Class Action Waiver provision may only be litigated in a court of competent jurisdiction, but the remainder of the agreement to arbitrate will be binding and enforceable. To avoid any doubt or uncertainty, the parties do not agree to class arbitration or to the arbitration of any claims brought on behalf of others.\nCLASS ACTION WAIVER FOR U.S. USERS. THESE TERMS DO NOT ALLOW CLASS OR COLLECTIVE ARBITRATIONS, EVEN IF THE AAA PROCEDURES OR RULES WOULD. NOTWITHSTANDING ANY OTHER PROVISION OF THESE TERMS, THE ARBITRATOR MAY AWARD MONEY OR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF ONLY IN FAVOR OF THE INDIVIDUAL PARTY SEEKING RELIEF AND ONLY TO THE EXTENT NECESSARY TO PROVIDE THE RELIEF WARRANTED BY THAT PARTY'S INDIVIDUAL CLAIM. ARBITRATION OR COURT PROCEEDINGS HELD UNDER THESE TERMS CANNOT BE BROUGHT, MAINTAINED OR RESOLVED ON BEHALF OF OR BY A CLASS, AS A PRIVATE ATTORNEY-GENERAL, OR IN ANY OTHER REPRESENTATIVE CAPACITY. IN ADDITION, INDIVIDUAL PROCEEDINGS CANNOT BE COMBINED WITHOUT THE CONSENT OF ALL OF THE PARTIES. ANY QUESTION REGARDING THE ENFORCEABILITY OR INTERPRETATION OF THIS PARAGRAPH WILL BE DECIDED BY A COURT AND NOT THE ARBITRATOR.\nJURY TRIAL WAIVER FOR U.S. USERS. IF FOR ANY REASON A DISPUTE PROCEEDS IN COURT RATHER THAN THROUGH ARBITRATION, YOU AND OATH AGREE THAT THERE WILL NOT BE A JURY TRIAL. YOU AND OATH UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVE ANY RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION, PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM IN ANY WAY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THESE TERMS. IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, THIS PARAGRAPH MAY BE FILED TO SHOW A WRITTEN CONSENT TO A TRIAL BY THE COURT.\nChoice of Law. These Terms and the relationship between the parties, including any claim or dispute that might arise between the parties, whether sounding in contract, tort, or otherwise, will be governed by the laws of the State of New York without regard to its conflict of law provisions. In no event will the parties bring claims against one another under the laws of another jurisdiction.\nForum. If for any reason a Dispute proceeds in court rather than through arbitration, all such Disputes (regardless of theory) arising out of or relating to these Terms, or the relationship between you and Oath, will be brought exclusively in the courts located in the county of New York, New York or the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York. In such cases, you and Oath agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of the courts located within the county of New York, New York or the Southern District of New York, and agree to waive any and all objections to the exercise of jurisdiction over the parties by such courts and to venue in such courts.\nCustomer Support.

WHILE ARBITRATION PROCEDURES MAY BE DIFFERENT THAN COURT PROCEDURES, AN ARBITRATOR CAN AWARD YOU INDIVIDUALLY THE SAME DAMAGES AND RELIEF AS A COURT, AND JUDGMENT ON THE AWARD RENDERED BY THE ARBITRATOR MAY BE ENTERED AND ENFORCED IN ANY COURT HAVING JURISDICTION THEREOF. THE PARTIES UNDERSTAND THAT ABSENT THIS MANDATORY PROVISION, THEY WOULD HAVE THE RIGHT TO SUE IN COURT AND HAVE A JURY TRIAL. THEY FURTHER UNDERSTAND THAT, IN SOME INSTANCES, THE COSTS OF ARBITRATION COULD EXCEED THE COSTS OF LITIGATION AND THE RIGHT TO DISCOVERY MAY BE MORE LIMITED IN ARBITRATION THAN IN COURT. We also both agree that:\nNotice of Dispute. If either you or Oath intends to arbitrate under these Terms, the party seeking arbitration must first notify the other party of the Dispute in writing at least 30 days in advance of initiating the arbitration. Notice to Oath should be sent to Oath either by mail to Oath, Attn: Disputes, 701 First Avenue, Sunnyvale, CA 94089; or disputes@oath.com. Notice to you will be to your email address(es) and street address(es), if any, that Oath has in its records at the time the notice is sent. The notice must describe the nature of the claim and the relief being sought. If we are unable to resolve the Dispute within 30 days, either party may then proceed to file a claim for arbitration.\nArbitration Procedure. The Federal Arbitration Act applies to these Terms. Except for small claims court cases, any and all Disputes will be resolved by arbitration administered by the American Arbitration Association (\"AAA\"). The AAA will apply the Commercial Arbitration Rules to the arbitration of any Dispute pursuant to these Terms, unless you are an individual and use the Services for personal or household use, in which case the AAA's Consumer Arbitration Rules will apply (excluding any rules or procedures governing or permitting class actions). You can get procedures (including the process for beginning an arbitration), rules and fee information from the AAA (www.adr.org). These Terms govern to the extent they conflict with the AAA\u2019s Commercial Arbitration Rules or Consumer Arbitration Rules.\nSmall Claims Court Option. As an alternative to arbitration, you may bring an individual action in small claims court in your county of residence (or if a business, your principal place of business) or Santa Clara County, California provided that your Dispute meets the requirements of the small claims court.\nArbitration Location. Unless you and Oath agree otherwise, the arbitration must take place, or the small claims action must be filed, in the county of your primary residence or Santa Clara County, California.\nArbitration Fees and Expenses. We will reimburse any filing fee that the AAA charges you for arbitration of the Dispute. If you provide us with signed written notice that you cannot pay the filing fee, we will pay the fee directly to the AAA. If the arbitration proceeds, we will also pay any administrative and arbitrator fees charged later.\nSettlement Offers. We may, but are not obligated to, make a written settlement offer anytime before or during arbitration. The amount or terms of any settlement offer may not be disclosed to the arbitrator unless and until the arbitrator issues an award on the claim. If you do not accept the offer and the arbitrator awards you an amount of money that is more than our offer but less than $5,000, we agree to: (a) pay you $5,000 instead of the lower amount awarded, (b) pay your reasonable attorney\u2019s fees and costs, and (c) reimburse any arbitration filing fees and arbitrator fees and expenses incurred in connection with the arbitration of your Dispute. If the arbitrator awards you more than $5,000 and we are not challenging the award, then we will pay you the amount of the award.\nSeverability. If any part of this agreement to arbitrate is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be unenforceable, the court will reform the agreement to the extent necessary to cure the unenforceable part(s), and the parties will arbitrate their Dispute(s) without reference to or reliance upon the unenforceable part(s). However, if for any reason the Class Action Waiver set forth below in subsection 14.3.c cannot be enforced as to some or all of the Dispute, then the agreement to arbitrate will not apply to that Dispute or portion thereof. Any Disputes covered by any deemed unenforceable Class Action Waiver provision may only be litigated in a court of competent jurisdiction, but the remainder of the agreement to arbitrate will be binding and enforceable. To avoid any doubt or uncertainty, the parties do not agree to class arbitration or to the arbitration of any claims brought on behalf of others.\nCLASS ACTION WAIVER. THESE TERMS DO NOT ALLOW CLASS OR COLLECTIVE ARBITRATIONS, EVEN IF THE AAA PROCEDURES OR RULES WOULD. NOTWITHSTANDING ANY OTHER PROVISION OF THESE TERMS, THE ARBITRATOR MAY AWARD MONEY OR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF ONLY IN FAVOR OF THE INDIVIDUAL PARTY SEEKING RELIEF AND ONLY TO THE EXTENT NECESSARY TO PROVIDE THE RELIEF WARRANTED BY THAT PARTY'S INDIVIDUAL CLAIM. ARBITRATION OR COURT PROCEEDINGS HELD UNDER THESE TERMS CANNOT BE BROUGHT, MAINTAINED OR RESOLVED ON BEHALF OF OR BY A CLASS, AS A PRIVATE ATTORNEY-GENERAL, OR IN ANY OTHER REPRESENTATIVE CAPACITY. IN ADDITION, INDIVIDUAL PROCEEDINGS CANNOT BE COMBINED WITHOUT THE CONSENT OF ALL OF THE PARTIES. ANY QUESTION REGARDING THE ENFORCEABILITY OR INTERPRETATION OF THIS PARAGRAPH WILL BE DECIDED BY A COURT AND NOT THE ARBITRATOR.\nJURY TRIAL WAIVER. IF FOR ANY REASON A DISPUTE PROCEEDS IN COURT RATHER THAN THROUGH ARBITRATION, YOU AND OATH AGREE THAT THERE WILL NOT BE A JURY TRIAL. YOU AND OATH UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVE ANY RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION, PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM IN ANY WAY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THESE TERMS. IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, THIS PARAGRAPH MAY BE FILED TO SHOW A WRITTEN CONSENT TO A TRIAL BY THE COURT.\nChoice of Law. These Terms and the relationship between the parties, including any claim or dispute that might arise between the parties, whether sounding in contract, tort, or otherwise, will be governed by the laws of the State of New York without regard to its conflict of law provisions. In no event will the parties bring claims against one another under the laws of another jurisdiction.\nForum. If for any reason a Dispute proceeds in court rather than through arbitration, all such Disputes (regardless of theory) arising out of or relating to these Terms, or the relationship between you and Oath, will be brought exclusively in the courts located in the county of New York, New York or the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York.

Each of you and Company agrees to give up the right to sue in court. The term \"Dispute\" is to be given the broadest possible meaning that will be enforced, and shall include any dispute, claim, demand, count, cause of action, or controversy between you and Company, whether based in contract, statute, regulation, ordinance, tort (including, but not limited to, fraud, misrepresentation, fraudulent inducement, negligence, or any other intentional tort), or any other legal or equitable theory. The term \"Dispute\" specifically includes, but is not limited to, any and all claims between you and Company in any way related to or concerning this Arbitration Agreement, any other aspect of these Terms of Use (including their applicability and their conformance to applicable law), any products or services provided by Company, any billing disputes, and any disputes relating to telephonic, text message, or any other communications either of us received from the other. The only exceptions to this Arbitration Agreement are that (i) each of you and Company retains the right to sue in small claims court and (ii) each of you and Company may bring suit in court against the other to enjoin infringement or other misuse of intellectual property rights. Disputes over whether these exceptions apply shall be resolved by the court in which such action has been brought; all other disputes over arbitrability shall be resolved by the arbitrator. Each of you and Company also agrees to give up the ability to seek to represent, in a class action or otherwise, anyone but each of you and Company (see paragraph 9 below). There is no judge or jury in arbitration, and court review of an arbitration award is limited. An arbitrator must follow this Agreement. The arbitrator, however, can award on an individual basis the same damages and relief as a court (including injunctive and declaratory relief, or statutory damages).\n(2) This Agreement evidences a transaction in interstate commerce, and thus the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1-16, governs the interpretation and enforcement of this Arbitration Agreement. This Arbitration Agreement shall survive termination of this Agreement.\n(3) Any arbitration between you and Company will be conducted by the Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Services, Inc. (\"JAMS\"), pursuant to the JAMS Streamlined Arbitration Rules & Procedures effective July 1, 2014 (the \"JAMS Rules\"), as modified by this agreement to arbitrate. The arbitration shall be conducted by a single, neutral arbitrator, and if you and Company cannot agree on who that single arbitrator will be, the arbitrator will be appointed pursuant to the JAMS Rules, with the participation and involvement of Company and you pursuant to JAMS Rule 12. The JAMS Rules are available on its website at https://www.jamsadr.com/rules-streamlined-arbitration/ . The Consumer Arbitration Minimum Standards are available at https://www.jamsadr.com/rules-streamlined-arbitration/. The arbitrator is bound by the terms of this Agreement.\n(4) If either you or Company wants to arbitrate a claim, you or Company must first send by mail to the other a written Notice of Dispute (\"Notice\") that sets forth the name, address, and contact information of the party giving notice, the specific facts giving rise to the Dispute, the Company Service to which the Notice relates, and the relief requested. Your Notice to the Company must be sent by mail to Arbitration Notice of Dispute, 2121 Avenue of the Stars, 7th Floor, Los Angeles, California, 90067. The Company will send any Notice to you at the contact information we have for you or that you provide. It is the sender's responsibility to ensure that the recipient receives the Notice. During the first 45 days after you or we send a Notice to the other, you and we may try to reach a settlement of the Dispute.\nIf you and we do not resolve the Dispute within 45 days, either you or we may initiate arbitration in accordance with the JAMS Rules. Further instructions on submitting a Demand for Arbitration may be found at www.jamsadr.com/files/Uploads/Documents/JAMS_Arbitration_Demand.pdf. In addition to filing this Demand for Arbitration with JAMS in accordance with its rules and procedures, you must send a copy of this completed Demand for Arbitration to the Company at the address listed above to which you sent your Notice of Dispute.\n(5) You and the Company acknowledge and agree to abide by the following rules for arbitration: (a) YOU AND COMPANY MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS, REPRESENTATIVE OR MULTI-CLAIMANT PROCEEDING, AND THE ARBITRATOR SHALL HAVE NO POWER TO AWARD CLASS-WIDE RELIEF; (b) the Company will pay arbitration costs as required by the JAMS Consumer Arbitration Minimum Standards and consistent with paragraph 6 below; (c) the arbitrator may award any individual relief or individual remedies that are permitted by applicable law; and (d) each side pays his, her or its own attorneys' fees, except as otherwise provided in paragraph 8 below.\n(6) JAMS charges filing and other fees to conduct arbitrations. Ordinarily, the claimant has to pay the filing fee to initiate arbitration, but if you wish to commence an arbitration against Company, you and the Company acknowledge and agree to abide by the following:\n- If you are seeking to recover less than $10,000 (inclusive of attorneys' fees), Company will pay the filing fee on your behalf or reimburse your payment of it.\n- If you are seeking to recover $10,000 or more, you will have to pay the filing fee charged by JAMS, but Company will reimburse the filing fee if you prevail on all claims decided upon by the arbitrator.\n- Company and you agree that, if the claims to be arbitrated total less than $10,000 (inclusive of attorneys' fees), the claim ordinarily should be decided on written submissions only, without a telephonic or in-person hearing. Company will not request a hearing for any claims totaling less than $10,000. This provision shall not be construed by the arbitrator to deprive you of any rights you may have to a telephonic or in-person hearing in your hometown area pursuant to the JAMS Rules.\n- Company and you agree that, if the claims to be arbitrated total $10,000 or more, the arbitration will occur in a manner and place consistent with the JAMS Rules.\n(7) Regardless of how the arbitration proceeds, each of you and Company shall cooperate in good faith in the exchange of non-privileged documents and information as necessary in accordance with the JAMS Rules, and the arbitrator shall issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain his or her findings and conclusions.\n(8) Each of you and Company may incur attorneys' fees during the arbitration. Each side agrees to pay his, her or its own attorneys' fees unless the claim(s) at issue permit the prevailing party to be paid its attorneys' fees, and in such instance, the fees awarded shall be determined by the applicable law(s). In addition to whatever rights you may have to recover your attorneys' fees under applicable law, if you prevail in the arbitration, and if Company failed to make a settlement offer to you before the arbitration or the amount you win is at least 25% greater than Company's highest settlement offer, then Company will pay your reasonable attorneys' fees in addition to the amount the arbitrator awarded. If Company wins the arbitration, you will be responsible for your own attorneys' fees. In addition, if the arbitrator, at the request of the winning party, finds that the losing party brought a claim or asserted a defense frivolously or for an improper purpose, then regardless of the amount in dispute, the arbitrator must order the losing party to pay both sides' arbitration fees and may order the losing party to pay the winning party's reasonable attorneys' fees, unless such an award of fees is prohibited by applicable law.\n(9) The arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party's individual claim. The arbitrator may not order Company to pay any monies to or take any actions with respect to persons other than you, unless Company explicitly consents in advance, after an arbitrator is selected, to permit the arbitrator to enter such an order. Further, unless Company expressly agrees, the arbitrator may not consolidate other persons' claims with yours, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative, multi-claimant or class proceeding.\n(10) You and Company agree to maintain the confidential nature of the arbitration proceeding and shall not disclose the fact of the arbitration, any documents exchanged as part of any mediation, proceedings of the arbitration, the arbitrator's decision and the existence or amount of any award, except as may be necessary to prepare for or conduct the arbitration (in which case anyone becoming privy to confidential information must undertake to preserve its confidentiality), or except as may be necessary in connection with a court application for a provisional remedy, a judicial challenge to an award or its enforcement, or unless otherwise required by law or court order.\n(11) With the exception of subpart (a) in paragraph (5) (i.e., the waiver of the ability to proceed on behalf of multiple claimants or a purported class), if any part of this Arbitration Agreement is deemed invalid, unenforceable, or illegal, then the balance of this Arbitration Agreement shall remain in effect and be construed in accordance with its terms as if the invalid, unenforceable, or illegal provision were not contained. If, however, subpart (a) in paragraph (5) is found invalid, unenforceable or illegal, then the entirety of this Arbitration Agreement shall be null and void, but the rest of this Agreement, including the provisions governing where actions against Company must be pursued, the choice of governing law, and our mutual waiver of the right to a trial by jury, will remain in effect and apply to any claim that, for this or any other reason, proceeds in court rather than in arbitration.\nGoverning Law\nThe Agreement will be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of New York, without regard to its conflict of law provisions.\nExcept with respect to Disputes to be resolved through an arbitration process in accordance with the Arbitration Agreement contained above, you and Company agree to submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts located in New York, New York to resolve any Dispute arising out of the Agreement or the Company Services. YOU HEREBY KNOWINGLY, VOLUNTARILY AND INTENTIONALLY WAIVE ANY RIGHT YOU MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LITIGATION (INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, ANY CLAIMS, COUNTERCLAIMS, CROSS-CLAIMS, OR THIRD PARTY CLAIMS) ARISING OUT OF, UNDER OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT.\nSUBJECT TO APPLICABLE LAW, YOU AGREE THAT ANY CAUSE OF ACTION YOU MAY HAVE ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT, THE COMPANY SITES OR THE COMPANY SERVICES MUST BE COMMENCED WITHIN ONE (1) YEAR AFTER SUCH CAUSE OF ACTION ACCRUES. AFTER SUCH PERIOD, SUCH CAUSE OF ACTION SHALL BE PERMANENTLY BARRED.\nIndemnity\nYou agree to indemnify and hold Company, its Company Affiliates, subcontractors and other partners, and their respective officers, agents, partners and employees, harmless from any loss, liability, claim, or demand, including, but not limited to, reasonable attorneys' fees, made by any third party due to or arising out of or in connection with YOUR BREACH OF YOUR REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES, COVENANTS OR AGREEMENTS HEREUNDER; YOUR VIOLATION OF THIS AGREEMENT OF USE OR ANY APPLICABLE LAW; YOUR USE OF THE COMPANY SERVICES AND/OR THE CONTENT IN VIOLATION OF THIS AGREEMENT; INFORMATION OR CONTENT POSTED OR TRANSMITTED THROUGH YOUR AUTHORIZED DEVICE OR ACCOUNT, EVEN IF NOT SUBMITTED BY YOU, THAT INFRINGES ANY COPYRIGHT, TRADEMARK, TRADE SECRET, TRADE DRESS, PATENT, PUBLICITY, PRIVACY OR OTHER RIGHT OF ANY PERSON OR ENTITY OR DEFAMES ANY PERSON OR ENTITY; AND ANY MISREPRESENTATION MADE BY YOU. YOU WILL COOPERATE AS FULLY AND AS REASONABLY REQUIRED IN COMPANY\u2019S DEFENSE OF ANY CLAIM. COMPANY RESERVES THE RIGHT, AT ITS OWN EXPENSE, TO ASSUME THE EXCLUSIVE DEFENSE AND CONTROL OF ANY MATTER OTHERWISE SUBJECT TO INDEMNIFICATION BY YOU, AND YOU SHALL NOT IN ANY EVENT SETTLE ANY SUCH MATTER WITHOUT THE WRITTEN CONSENT OF COMPANY.\nUnsolicited Submissions\nCompany does not knowingly accept, via the Company Services or otherwise, unsolicited submissions including, without limitation, submissions by you of blog ideas, articles, scripts, story lines, fan fiction, characters, drawings, information, suggestions, proposals, ideas or concepts. Company requests that you do not make any unsolicited submissions. Any similarity between an unsolicited submission and any elements in any Company or Affiliated Company creative work including, without limitation, a film, series, story, title or concept would be purely coincidental. If you do send any submissions to Company via the Company Services that are unsolicited (including but not limited to any Forum), however, you agree that (i) your unsolicited submissions are not being made in confidence or trust and that by making such submissions no contractual or fiduciary relationship is created between you and Company; (ii) any such unsolicited submissions and copyright become the property of and will be owned by Company (and are not User Content licensed by you to Company under \"Your Proprietary Rights in and License to Your User Content\") and may be used, copied, sublicensed, adapted, transmitted, distributed, publicly performed, published, displayed or deleted as Company sees fit; (iii) you are not entitled to any compensation, credit or notice whatsoever in connection with such submissions; and (iv) by sending an unsolicited submission you waive the right to make any claim against Company or Company Affiliates relating to any unsolicited submissions by you, including, without limitation, unfair competition, breach of implied contract or breach of confidentiality.\nEmployment Opportunities\nCompany may, from time to time, post Company employment opportunities on the Company Services and/or invite users to submit resumes to it. If you choose to submit your name, contact information, resume and/or other personal information to Company in response to employment listings, you are authorizing Company to utilize this information for all lawful and legitimate hiring and employment purposes. Company also reserves the right, at its sole discretion, to forward the information you submit to its Company Affiliates for legitimate business purposes. Nothing in this Agreement or contained in the Company Services will constitute a promise by Company to contact, interview, hire or employ any individual who submits information to it, nor will anything in this Agreement or contained in the Company Services constitute a promise that Company will review any or all of the information submitted to it by users of the Company Services.\n\u00a9Associated Press.

Precisely how Company responds to a party that is violating this Agreement will be determined after carefully analyzing all of the facts and circumstances of a particular case. You may not rely upon Company's precise response with respect to one party or one situation as any indication of what Company might do with respect to another party or another situation, even if the parties or situations appear to you to be similar.\nSimilarly, the failure of Company to exercise or enforce any right or provision of this Agreement will not operate as a waiver of such right or provision. If we fail to act in response to a violation of this Agreement, you should not assume that we do not object to the violation or even that we are aware of it. In addition, you may not construe a waiver of any provision of this Agreement with respect to any party as a waiver of that provision (or any other provision) with respect to either that party or any other party. Further, Company's decision to delay exercising or enforcing any right or remedy under this Agreement shall not constitute a waiver of such right or remedy. Even if Company acts in a way that appears to you to be inconsistent with this Agreement, Company's action shall not be deemed a waiver or constructive amendment of this Agreement.\nThe Section titles in this Agreement are for convenience only and have no legal or contractual effect.

Changes to these Terms of Service\nWe may modify this agreement, but we will give you 30 days&apos notice of changes that affect your rights.\nS. Miscellaneous\nPlease see this section for legal details including our choice of law.\nEffective date: May 25, 2018\nShort version: We use these basic terms throughout the agreement, and they have specific meanings. You should know what we mean when we use each of the terms. There&aposs not going to be a test on it, but it&aposs still useful information.\n---The \u201cAgreement\u201d refers, collectively, to all the terms, conditions, notices contained or referenced in this document (the \u201cTerms of Service\u201d or the \"Terms\") and all other operating rules, policies (including the GitHub Privacy Statement, available at github.com/site/privacy) and procedures that we may publish from time to time on the Website. Most of our site policies are available at help.github.com/categories/site-policy.\n---The \u201cService\u201d refers to the applications, software, products, and services provided by GitHub.\n---The \u201cWebsite\u201d refers to GitHub\u2019s website located at github.com, and all content, services, and products provided by GitHub at or through the Website. It also refers to GitHub-owned subdomains of github.com, such as education.github.com and pages.github.com. These Terms also govern GitHub\u2019s conference websites, such as githubuniverse.com, and product websites, such as atom.io. Occasionally, websites owned by GitHub may provide different or additional terms of service. If those additional terms conflict with this Agreement, the more specific terms apply to the relevant page or service.\n---\u201cThe User,\u201d \u201cYou,\u201d and \u201cYour\u201d refer to the individual person, company, or organization that has visited or is using the Website or Service; that accesses or uses any part of the Account; or that directs the use of the Account in the performance of its functions. A User must be at least 13 years of age. Special terms may apply for business or government Accounts (See Section B(5): Additional Terms).\n---\u201cGitHub,\u201d \u201cWe,\u201d and \u201cUs\u201d refer to GitHub, Inc., as well as our affiliates, directors, subsidiaries, contractors, licensors, officers, agents, and employees.\n---\u201cContent\u201d refers to content featured or displayed through the Website, including without limitation text, data, articles, images, photographs, graphics, software, applications, designs, features, and other materials that are available on the Website or otherwise available through the Service. \"Content\" also includes Services. \u201cUser-Generated Content\u201d is Content, written or otherwise, created or uploaded by our Users. \"Your Content\" is Content that you create or own.\n---An \"Account\" represents your legal relationship with GitHub. A \u201cUser Account\u201d represents an individual User\u2019s authorization to log in to and use the Service and serves as a User\u2019s identity on GitHub. \u201cOrganizations\u201d are shared workspaces that may be associated with a single entity or with one or more Users where multiple Users can collaborate across many projects at once. A User Account can be a member of any number of Organizations.\nShort version: User Accounts and Organizations have different administrative controls; a human must create your Account; you must be 13 or over; you must provide a valid email address; and you may not have more than one free Account. You alone are responsible for your Account and anything that happens while you are signed in to or using your Account. You are responsible for keeping your Account secure.\n1. Account Controls\n---\nUsers. Subject to these Terms, you retain ultimate administrative control over your User Account and the Content within it.\n---\nOrganizations. The \"owner\" of an Organization that was created under these Terms has ultimate administrative control over that Organization and the Content within it. Within the Service, an owner can manage User access to the Organization\u2019s data and projects. An Organization may have multiple owners, but there must be at least one User Account designated as an owner of an Organization. If you are the owner of an Organization under these Terms, we consider you responsible for the actions that are performed on or through that Organization.\n2. Required Information\nYou must provide a valid email address in order to complete the signup process. Any other information requested, such as your real name, is optional, unless you are accepting these terms on behalf of a legal entity (in which case we need more information about the legal entity) or if you opt for a paid Account, in which case additional information will be necessary for billing purposes.\n3. Account Requirements\nWe have a few simple rules for User Accounts on GitHub&aposs Service.\n---You must be a human to create an Account. Accounts registered by \"bots\" or other automated methods are not permitted. We do permit machine accounts:  \n---A machine account is an Account set up by an individual human who accepts the Terms on behalf of the Account, provides a valid email address, and is responsible for its actions. A machine account is used exclusively for performing automated tasks. Multiple users may direct the actions of a machine account, but the owner of the Account is ultimately responsible for the machine&aposs actions. You may maintain no more than one free machine account in addition to your free User Account.\n---One person or legal entity may maintain no more than one free Account (if you choose to control a machine account as well, that&aposs fine, but it can only be used for running a machine).\n---You must be age 13 or older. While we are thrilled to see brilliant young coders get excited by learning to program, we must comply with United States law. GitHub does not target our Service to children under 13, and we do not permit any Users under 13 on our Service. If we learn of any User under the age of 13, we will terminate that User\u2019s Account immediately. If you are a resident of a country outside the United States, your country\u2019s minimum age may be older; in such a case, you are responsible for complying with your country\u2019s laws.\n---Your login may only be used by one person \u2014 i.e., a single login may not be shared by multiple people. A paid Organization  may only provide access to as many User Accounts as your subscription allows.\n4. User Account Security\nYou are responsible for keeping your Account secure while you use our Service. We offer tools such as two-factor authentication to help you maintain your Account&aposs security, but the content of your Account and its security are up to you.\n---You are responsible for all content posted and activity that occurs under your Account (even when content is posted by others who have Accounts under your Account).\n---You are responsible for maintaining the security of your Account and password. GitHub cannot and will not be liable for any loss or damage from your failure to comply with this security obligation.\n---You will promptly notify GitHub if you become aware of any unauthorized use of, or access to, our Service through your Account, including any unauthorized use of your password or Account.\n5. Additional Terms\nIn some situations, third parties&apos terms may apply to your use of GitHub. For example, you may be a member of an organization on GitHub with its own terms or license agreements; you may download an application that integrates with GitHub; or you may use GitHub to authenticate to another service. Please be aware that while these Terms are our full agreement with you, other parties&apos terms govern their relationships with you.\nIf you are a government User or otherwise accessing or using any GitHub Service in a government capacity, this Government Amendment to GitHub Terms of Service applies to you, and you agree to its provisions.\nIf you have signed up for GitHub Enterprise Cloud, the Enterprise Cloud Addendum applies to you, and you agree to its provisions.\nShort version: GitHub hosts a wide variety of collaborative projects from all over the world, and that collaboration only works when our users are able to work together in good faith. While using the service, you must follow this Acceptable Use Policy, which includes some restrictions on content you can post, conduct on the service, and other limitations. In short, be excellent to each other.\n1. Compliance with Laws and Regulations\nYour use of the Website and Service must not violate any applicable laws, including copyright or trademark laws, export control laws, or other laws in your jurisdiction. You are responsible for making sure that your use of the Service is in compliance with laws and any applicable regulations.\n2. Content Restrictions\nYou agree that you will not under any circumstances upload, post, host, or transmit any content that:\n---is unlawful or promotes unlawful activities;\n---is or contains sexually obscene content;\n---is libelous, defamatory, or fraudulent;\n---is discriminatory or abusive toward any individual or group;\n---contains or installs any active malware or exploits, or uses our platform for exploit delivery (such as part of a command and control system); or\n---infringes on any proprietary right of any party, including patent, trademark, trade secret, copyright, right of publicity, or other rights.\n3. Conduct Restrictions\nWhile using GitHub, you agree that you will not under any circumstances:\n---harass, abuse, threaten, or incite violence towards any individual or group, including GitHub employees, officers, and agents, or other GitHub Users;\n---use our servers for any form of excessive automated bulk activity (for example, spamming), or relay any other form of unsolicited advertising or solicitation through our servers, such as get-rich-quick schemes;\n---attempt to disrupt or tamper with GitHub&aposs servers in ways that could harm our Website or Service, to place undue burden on GitHub&aposs servers through automated means, or to access GitHub&aposs Service in ways that exceed your authorization (other than those authorized by the GitHub Bug Bounty program);\n---impersonate any person or entity, including any of our employees or representatives, including through false association with GitHub, or by fraudulently misrepresenting your identity or site&aposs purpose; or\n---violate the privacy of any third party, such as by posting another person&aposs personal information without consent.\n4. Services Usage Limits\nYou agree not to reproduce, duplicate, copy, sell, resell or exploit any portion of the Service, use of the Service, or access to the Service without GitHub&aposs express written permission.\n5. Scraping\nScraping refers to extracting data from our Website via an automated process, such as a bot or webcrawler. It does not refer to the collection of information through GitHub&aposs API. Please see Section H for our API Terms. You may scrape the website for the following reasons:\n---Researchers may scrape public, non-personal information from GitHub for research purposes, only if any publications resulting from that research are open access.\n---Archivists may scrape GitHub for public data for archival purposes.\nYou may not scrape GitHub for spamming purposes, including for the purposes of selling GitHub users&apos personal information, such as to recruiters, headhunters, and job boards.\nAll use of GitHub data gathered through scraping must comply with the GitHub Privacy Statement.\n6. Privacy\nMisuse of GitHub Users&apos Personal Information is prohibited.\nAny person, entity, or service collecting data from GitHub must comply with the GitHub Privacy Statement, particularly in regards to the collection of our Users&apos Personal Information (as defined in the GitHub Privacy Statement). If you collect any GitHub User&aposs Personal Information from GitHub, you agree that you will only use the Personal Information you gather for the purpose for which our User has authorized it. You agree that you will reasonably secure any Personal Information you have gathered from GitHub, and you will respond promptly to complaints, removal requests, and \"do not contact\" requests from GitHub or GitHub Users.\n7. Excessive Bandwidth Use\nIf we determine your bandwidth usage to be significantly excessive in relation to other GitHub customers, we reserve the right to suspend your Account or throttle your file hosting until you can reduce your bandwidth consumption.\n8. User Protection\nYou agree not to engage in activity that significantly harms our Users. We will resolve disputes in favor of protecting our Users as a whole.\nShort version: You own content you create, but you allow us certain rights to it, so that we can display and share the content you post. You still have control over your content, and responsibility for it, and the rights you grant us are limited to those we need to provide the service. We have the right to remove content or close Accounts if we need to.\n1. Responsibility for User-Generated Content\nYou may create or upload User-Generated Content while using the Service. You are solely responsible for the content of, and for any harm resulting from, any User-Generated Content that you post, upload, link to or otherwise make available via the Service, regardless of the form of that Content. We are not responsible for any public display or misuse of your User-Generated Content.\n2. GitHub May Remove Content\nWe do not pre-screen User-Generated Content, but we have the right (though not the obligation) to refuse or remove any User-Generated Content that, in our sole discretion, violates any GitHub terms or policies.\n3. Ownership of Content, Right to Post, and License Grants\nYou retain ownership of and responsibility for Your Content. If you&aposre posting anything you did not create yourself or do not own the rights to, you agree that you are responsible for any Content you post; that you will only submit Content that you have the right to post; and that you will fully comply with any third party licenses relating to Content you post.\nBecause you retain ownership of and responsibility for Your Content, we need you to grant us \u2014 and other GitHub Users \u2014 certain legal permissions, listed in Sections D.4 \u2014 D.7. These license grants apply to Your Content. If you upload Content that already comes with a license granting GitHub the permissions we need to run our Service, no additional license is required. You understand that you will not receive any payment for any of the rights granted in Sections D.4 \u2014 D.7. The licenses you grant to us will end when you remove Your Content from our servers, unless other Users have forked it.\n4. License Grant to Us\nWe need the legal right to do things like host Your Content, publish it, and share it. You grant us and our legal successors the right to store, parse, and display Your Content, and make incidental copies as necessary to render the Website and provide the Service. This includes the right to do things like copy it to our database and make backups; show it to you and other users; parse it into a search index or otherwise analyze it on our servers; share it with other users; and perform it, in case Your Content is something like music or video.\nThis license does not grant GitHub the right to sell Your Content or otherwise distribute or use it outside of our provision of the Service.\n5. License Grant to Other Users\nAny User-Generated Content you post publicly, including issues, comments, and contributions to other Users&apos repositories, may be viewed by others. By setting your repositories to be viewed publicly, you agree to allow others to view and \"fork\" your repositories (this means that others may make their own copies of Content from your repositories in repositories they control).\nIf you set your pages and repositories to be viewed publicly, you grant each User of GitHub a nonexclusive, worldwide license to use, display, and perform Your Content through the GitHub Service and to reproduce Your Content solely on GitHub as permitted through GitHub&aposs functionality (for example, through forking). You may grant further rights if you adopt a license. If you are uploading Content you did not create or own, you are responsible for ensuring that the Content you upload is licensed under terms that grant these permissions to other GitHub Users.\n6. Contributions Under Repository License\nWhenever you make a contribution to a repository containing notice of a license, you license your contribution under the same terms, and you agree that you have the right to license your contribution under those terms. If you have a separate agreement to license your contributions under different terms, such as a contributor license agreement, that agreement will supersede.\nIsn&apost this just how it works already? Yep. This is widely accepted as the norm in the open-source community; it&aposs commonly referred to by the shorthand \"inbound=outbound\". We&aposre just making it explicit.\n7. Moral Rights\nYou retain all moral rights to Your Content that you upload, publish, or submit to any part of the Service, including the rights of integrity and attribution. However, you waive these rights and agree not to assert them against us, to enable us to reasonably exercise the rights granted in Section D.4, but not otherwise.\nTo the extent this agreement is not enforceable by applicable law, you grant GitHub the rights we need to use Your Content without attribution and to make reasonable adaptations of Your Content as necessary to render the Website and provide the Service.\nShort version: You may have access to private repositories. We treat the content of private repositories as confidential, and we only access it for support reasons, with your consent, or if required to for security reasons.\n1. Control of Private Repositories.\nSome Accounts, such as paid Accounts, may have private repositories, which allow the User to control access to Content.\n2. Confidentiality of Private Repositories.\nGitHub considers the contents of private repositories to be confidential to you. GitHub will protect the contents of private repositories from unauthorized use, access, or disclosure in the same manner that we would use to protect our own confidential information of a similar nature and in no event with less than a reasonable degree of care.\n3. Access.\nGitHub employees may only access the content of your private repositories in the following situations:\n---With your consent and knowledge, for support reasons. If GitHub accesses a private repository for support reasons, we will only do so with the owner\u2019s consent and knowledge.\n---When access is required for security reasons, including when access is required to maintain ongoing confidentiality, integrity, availability and resilience of GitHub&aposs systems and Service.\nYou may choose to enable additional access to your private repositories. For example:\n---You may enable various GitHub services or features that require additional rights to Your Content in private repositories. These rights may vary depending on the service or feature, but GitHub will continue to treat your private repository Content as confidential. If those services or features require rights in addition to those we need to provide the GitHub Service, we will provide an explanation of those rights.\n4. Exclusions.\nIf we have reason to believe the contents of a private repository are in violation of the law or of these Terms, we have the right to access, review, and remove them. Additionally, we may be compelled by law to disclose the contents of your private repositories.\nIf you believe that content on our website violates your copyright, please contact us in accordance with our Digital Millennium Copyright Act Policy. If you are a copyright owner and you believe that content on GitHub violates your rights, please contact us via our convenient DMCA form or by emailing copyright@github.com. There may be legal consequences for sending a false or frivolous takedown notice. Before sending a takedown request, you must consider legal uses such as fair use and licensed uses.\nWe will terminate the Accounts of repeat infringers of this policy.\nShort version: We own the service and all of our content. In order for you to use our content, we give you certain rights to it, but you may only use our content in the way we have allowed.\n1. GitHub&aposs Rights to Content\nGitHub and our licensors, vendors, agents, and/or our content providers retain ownership of all intellectual property rights of any kind related to the Website and Service. We reserve all rights that are not expressly granted to you under this Agreement or by law. The look and feel of the Website and Service is copyright \u00a9 GitHub, Inc. All rights reserved. You may not duplicate, copy, or reuse any portion of the HTML/CSS, Javascript, or visual design elements or concepts without express written permission from GitHub.\n2. GitHub Trademarks and Logos\nIf you\u2019d like to use GitHub\u2019s trademarks, you must follow all of our trademark guidelines, including those on our logos page: https://github.com/logos.\n3. License to GitHub Policies\nThis Agreement is licensed under this Creative Commons Zero license. For details, see our site-policy repository.\nShort version: You agree to these Terms of Service, plus this Section H, when using any of GitHub&aposs APIs (Application Provider Interface), including use of the API through a third party product that accesses GitHub.\nNo Abuse or Overuse of the API\nAbuse or excessively frequent requests to GitHub via the API may result in the temporary or permanent suspension of your Account&aposs access to the API. GitHub, in our sole discretion, will determine abuse or excessive usage of the API. We will make a reasonable attempt to warn you via email prior to suspension.\nYou may not share API tokens to exceed GitHub&aposs rate limitations.\nYou may not use the API to download data or Content from GitHub for spamming purposes, including for the purposes of selling GitHub users&apos personal information, such as to recruiters, headhunters, and job boards.\nAll use of the GitHub API is subject to these Terms of Service and the GitHub Privacy Statement.\nGitHub may offer subscription-based access to our API for those Users who require high-throughput access or access that would result in resale of GitHub&aposs Service.\nShort version: The GitHub Pages hosting service is subject to certain rules, in addition to the rest of the Terms.\nEach GitHub Account comes with access to the GitHub Pages static hosting service. This hosting service is intended to host static web pages for GitHub users. GitHub Pages are subject to some specific bandwidth and usage limits, and may not be appropriate for some high-bandwidth uses or other prohibited uses. Please see our GitHub Pages guidelines for more information.\nGitHub reserves the right at all times to reclaim any GitHub subdomain without liability.\nShort version: You need to follow certain rules if you create an application for other Users, and there are additional Terms that cover the Marketplace.\n1. Creating Applications\nIf you create a third-party application or other developer product that collects User Personal Information or User-Generated Content and integrates with the Service through GitHub&aposs API, OAuth mechanism, or otherwise (\"Developer Product\"), and make it available for other Users, then you must comply with the following requirements:\n---You must comply with this Agreement and the GitHub Privacy Statement.\n---Except as otherwise permitted, such as by law or by a license, you must limit your usage of the User Personal Information or User-Generated Content you collect to that purpose for which the User has authorized its collection. \n---You must take all reasonable security measures appropriate to the risks, such as against accidental or unlawful destruction, or accidental loss, alteration, unauthorized disclosure or access, presented by processing the User Personal Information or User-Generated Content.\n---You must not hold yourself out as collecting any User Personal Information or User-Generated Content on GitHub\u2019s behalf, and provide sufficient notice of your privacy practices to the User, such as by posting a privacy policy.\n---You must provide Users with a method of deleting any User Personal Information or User-Generated Content you have collected through GitHub after it is no longer needed for the limited and specified purposes for which the User authorized its collection, except where retention is required by law or otherwise permitted, such as through a license.\nIf you list a Developer Product through GitHub Marketplace, then you must agree to the GitHub Marketplace Developer Agreement, prior to submitting the project to be listed. \n2. Using Third-Party Applications\nYou may grant a Developer Product authorization to use, access, and disclose the contents of your repositories, including your private repositories. Some Developer Products are available through GitHub Marketplace. Some Developer Products can be used for performing automated tasks, and often times multiple Users may direct the actions of a Developer Product. However, if you purchase and/or set up a Developer Product on your Account, or you are an owner of an Account with an integrated Developer Product, then you will be responsible for the Developer Product&aposs actions that are performed on or through your Account. Please see our Privacy Statement for more information about how we share data with Developer Products. \nGitHub makes no warranties of any kind in relation to Developer Products and is not liable for disclosures to third parties that you authorize to access Your Content. Your use of any third-party applications is at your sole risk.\nIf you buy Developer Products through GitHub Marketplace, the GitHub Marketplace Terms of Service controls your purchase. This Agreement, as well as the GitHub Marketplace Terms of Service, will govern your use of GitHub Marketplace. \nShort version: We do not generally prohibit use of GitHub for advertising. However, we expect our users to follow certain limitations, so GitHub does not become a spam haven. No one wants that.\n1. GitHub Pages\nWe offer Pages sites primarily as a showcase for personal and organizational projects. Some monetization efforts are permitted on Pages, such as donation buttons and crowdfunding links.\n2. GitHub Repositories\nGitHub repositories are intended to host Content. You may include static images, links, and promotional text in the README documents associated with your repositories, but they must be related to the project you are hosting on GitHub.\nYou may not advertise in other Users&apos repositories, such as by posting monetized or excessive bulk content in issues.\n3. Spamming and Inappropriate Use of GitHub\nAdvertising Content, like all Content, must not violate the law or these Terms of Use, for example through excessive bulk activity such as spamming. We reserve the right to remove any advertisements that, in our sole discretion, violate any GitHub terms or policies.\nShort version: You are responsible for any fees associated with your use of GitHub. We are responsible for communicating those fees to you clearly and accurately, and letting you know well in advance if those prices change.\n1. Pricing\nOur pricing and payment terms are available at github.com/pricing. If you agree to a subscription price, that will remain your price for the duration of the payment term; however, prices are subject to change at the end of a payment term.\n2. Upgrades, Downgrades, and Changes\n---We will immediately bill you when you upgrade from the free plan to any paying plan.\n---If you change from a monthly billing plan to a yearly billing plan, GitHub will bill you for a full year at the next monthly billing date.\n---If you upgrade to a higher level of service, we will bill you for the upgraded plan immediately.\n---You may change your level of service at any time by choosing a plan option or going into your Billing settings. If you choose to downgrade your Account, you may lose access to Content, features, or capacity of your Account. Please see our section on Cancellation for information on getting a copy of that Content.\n3. Billing Schedule; No Refunds\n---For monthly or yearly payment plans, the Service is billed in advance on a monthly or yearly basis respectively and is non-refundable. There will be no refunds or credits for partial months of service, downgrade refunds, or refunds for months unused with an open Account; however, the service will remain active for the length of the paid billing period.\n---In order to treat everyone equally, no exceptions will be made.\n4. Authorization\nBy agreeing to these Terms, you are giving us permission to charge your on-file credit card, PayPal account, or other approved methods of payment for fees that you authorize for GitHub.\n5. Responsibility for Payment\nYou are responsible for all fees, including taxes, associated with your use of the Service. By using the Service, you agree to pay GitHub any charge incurred in connection with your use of the Service.  If you dispute the matter, contact GitHub Support. You are responsible for providing us with a valid means of payment for paid Accounts. Free Accounts are not required to provide payment information.\nShort version: You may close your Account at any time. If you do, we&aposll treat your information responsibly.\n1. Account Cancellation\nIt is your responsibility to properly cancel your Account with GitHub. You can cancel your Account at any time by going into your Settings in the global navigation bar at the top of the screen. The Account screen provides a simple, no questions asked cancellation link. We are not able to cancel Accounts in response to an email or phone request.\n2. Upon Cancellation\nWe will retain and use your information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements, but barring legal requirements, we will delete your full profile and the Content of your repositories within 90 days of cancellation or termination (though some information may remain in encrypted backups). This information can not be recovered once your Account is cancelled.\nWe will not delete Content that you have contributed to other Users&apos repositories or that other Users have forked.\nUpon request, we will make a reasonable effort to provide an Account owner with a copy of your lawful, non-infringing Account contents after Account cancellation, termination, or downgrade. You must make this request within 90 days of cancellation, termination, or downgrade.\n3. GitHub May Terminate\nGitHub has the right to suspend or terminate your access to all or any part of the Website at any time, with or without cause, with or without notice, effective immediately. GitHub reserves the right to refuse service to anyone for any reason at any time.\n4. Survival\nAll provisions of this Agreement which by their nature should survive termination will survive termination, including, without limitation, ownership provisions, warranty disclaimers, indemnity, and limitations of liability.\nShort version: We use email and other electronic means to stay in touch with our users.\n1. Electronic Communication Required\nFor contractual purposes, you (1) consent to receive communications from us in an electronic form via the email address you have submitted or via the Service; and (2) agree that all Terms of Service, agreements, notices, disclosures, and other communications that we provide to you electronically satisfy any legal requirement that those communications would satisfy if they were on paper. This section does not affect your non-waivable rights.\n2. Legal Notice to GitHub Must Be in Writing\nCommunications made through email or GitHub Support&aposs messaging system will not constitute legal notice to GitHub or any of its officers, employees, agents or representatives in any situation where notice to GitHub is required by contract or any law or regulation. Legal notice to GitHub must be in writing and served on GitHub&aposs legal agent.\n3. No Phone Support\nGitHub only offers support via email, in-Service communications, and electronic messages.

IMDB MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, AS TO THE OPERATION OF THE IMDB SERVICES OR THE INFORMATION, CONTENT, MATERIALS, PRODUCTS (INCLUDING SOFTWARE) OR OTHER SERVICES INCLUDED ON OR OTHERWISE MADE AVAILABLE TO YOU THROUGH THE  IMDB SERVICES. YOU EXPRESSLY AGREE THAT YOUR USE OF THE IMDB SERVICES IS AT YOUR SOLE RISK. IMDB RESERVES THE RIGHT TO WITHDRAW ANY IMDB SERVICE OR DELETE ANY INFORMATION FROM THE IMDB SERVICES AT ANY TIME IN ITS DISCRETION.\nTO THE FULL EXTENT PERMISSIBLE BY APPLICABLE LAW, IMDB DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. IMDB DOES NOT WARRANT THAT  THE IMDB SERVICES, INFORMATION, CONTENT, MATERIALS, PRODUCTS (INCLUDING SOFTWARE) OR OTHER SERVICES INCLUDED ON OR OTHERWISE MADE AVAILABLE TO YOU THROUGH THE IMDB SERVICES, ITS SERVERS, OR  ELECTRONIC COMMUNICATIONS SENT FROM IMDB ARE FREE OF VIRUSES OR OTHER HARMFUL COMPONENTS. IMDB WILL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY DAMAGES OF ANY KIND ARISING FROM THE USE OF  ANY IMDB SERVICE, OR FROM ANY INFORMATION, CONTENT, MATERIALS, PRODUCTS (INCLUDING SOFTWARE) OR OTHER SERVICES INCLUDED ON OR OTHERWISE MADE AVAILABLE TO YOU THROUGH ANY IMDB SERVICE, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, PUNITIVE, AND CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES.\nCERTAIN STATE LAWS DO NOT ALLOW LIMITATIONS ON IMPLIED WARRANTIES OR THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF CERTAIN DAMAGES. IF THESE LAWS APPLY TO YOU, SOME OR ALL OF THE ABOVE DISCLAIMERS, EXCLUSIONS, OR LIMITATIONS MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU, AND YOU MIGHT HAVE ADDITIONAL RIGHTS.\nIMDb Software Terms\nIn addition to these Conditions of Use, the terms found here apply to any software (including any updates or upgrades to the software and any related documentation) that we make available to you from time to time for your use in connection with IMDb Services (\u201cIMDb Software\u201d).  If we provide specific Terms for the IMDb Software and there is a conflict between the specific Terms for the IMDb Software and these Conditions of Use, the specific Terms for the IMDb Software will govern.\nBy using any IMDb Service, you agree that the laws of the state of Washington, without regard to principles of conflict of laws, will govern these Conditions of Use and any dispute of any sort that might arise between you and IMDb.  \nAny dispute or claim relating in any way to your use of  any IMDb Service, or any products or services sold or distributed by IMDb or through the IMDb Services will be resolved by binding arbitration, rather than in court, except that you may assert claims in small claims court if your claims qualify. The Federal Arbitration Act and federal arbitration law apply to this agreement.\na.        There is no judge or jury in arbitration, and court review of an arbitration award is limited. However, an arbitrator can award on an individual basis the same damages and relief as a court (including injunctive and declaratory relief or statutory damages), and must follow the terms of these Conditions of Use as a court would.\nb.      To begin an arbitration proceeding, you must send a letter requesting arbitration and describing your claim to our registered agent Corporation Service Company, 300 Deschutes Way SW, Suite 304, Tumwater, WA 98051. The arbitration will be conducted by the American Arbitration Association (AAA) under its rules, including the AAA\u2019s Supplementary Procedures for Consumer-Related Disputes. The AAA\u2019s rules are available at www.adr.org or by calling 1-800-778-7879. Payment of all filing, administration and arbitrator fees will be governed by the AAA\u2019s rules. We will reimburse those fees for claims totaling less than $10,000 unless the arbitrator determines the claims are frivolous. Likewise, IMDb will not seek attorneys\u2019 fees and costs in arbitration unless the arbitrator determines the claims are frivolous. You may choose to have the arbitration conducted by telephone, based on written submissions, or in person in the county where you live or at another mutually agreed location.  \nc.         You and IMDb each agree that any dispute resolution proceedings will be conducted only on an individual basis and not in a class, consolidated or representative action. If for any reason a claim proceeds in court rather than in arbitration you and IMDb each waive any right to a jury trial. You and IMDb also both agree that you or we may bring suit in court to enjoin infringement or other misuse of intellectual property rights.\nPlease review our other policies. These policies also govern your  use of IMDb Services. We reserve the right to make changes to our site, policies, and these our site, policies, Terms, and these Conditions of Use at any time. If any of these conditions shall be deemed invalid, void, or for any reason unenforceable, that condition shall be deemed severable and shall not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining condition.  \nIMDb.com, Inc.\nP.O. Box 81226\nSeattle, WA 98108-1226\nhttp://www.imdb.com/\nAdditional IMDb Software Terms\n--- Use of the IMDb Software.  You may use the IMDb Software only in connection with the IMDb Services. You may not separate any individual component of the IMDb Software for use other than in connection with the IMDb Services, incorporate any portion of it into your own programs or compile any portion of it in combination with your own programs, transfer it for use with another service, use it, or any portion of it, over a network, or sell, rent, lease, lend, loan, distribute or sub-license the IMDb Software or otherwise assign any rights to the IMDb Software in whole or in part. You may not use the IMDb Software for any illegal purpose.  We may discontinue some or all of any IMDb Software we provide, and we may terminate your right to use any IMDb Software at any time and in such event may modify it to make it inoperable.  Your rights to use the IMDb Software will automatically terminate without notice from us if you fail to comply with any of these terms.  Additional third party terms contained within or distributed with certain IMDb Software that are specifically identified in related documentation may apply to that IMDb Software and will govern the use of that IMDb Software in the event of a conflict with these Conditions of Use.    \n--- Use of Third Party Services. When you use the IMDb Software, you may also be using the services of one or more third parties, such as a wireless carrier or a mobile platform provider. Your use of these third party services may be subject to the separate policies, terms of use, and fees of these third parties.\n--- No Reverse Engineering.  You may not, and you will not encourage, assist or authorize any other person to modify, reverse engineer, decompile or disassemble, or otherwise tamper with, the IMDb Software, whether in whole or in part, or create any derivative works from or of the IMDb Software.\n--- Updates. In order to keep the IMDb Software up-to-date, we may offer automatic or manual updates at any time and without notice to you. \n---Export Regulations; Government End Users. You must comply with all export and re-export restrictions and regulations of the Department of Commerce and other United States agencies and authorities that may apply to the IMDb Software. If you are a U.S. Government end user, we are licensing the IMDb Software to you as a \"Commercial Item\" as that term is defined in the U.S. Code of Federal Regulations (see 48 C.F.R. \u00a7 2.101), and the rights we grant you to the IMDb Software are the same as the rights we grant to all others under these Conditions of Use.\nClear your history\n\u00a0\n \n"

We also have community rules, developed thanks to input from the Imgurian community, that serve as rules for using Imgur publicly.\nIf someone else might own the copyright to it, don't upload it. Don't upload gore, \"hate speech\" (i.e. demeaning race, gender, age, religious or sexual orientation, etc.), or material that is threatening, harassing, defamatory, or that encourages violence or crime. Don't upload illegal content such as child porn or nonconsensual (\"revenge\") porn. Don't hotlink to adult content or to file-sharing, gambling, torrent, warez, or Imgur rip-off sites. Don't impersonate someone else. Also, don't use Imgur to host image libraries you link to from elsewhere, content for your website, advertising, avatars, or anything else that turns us into your content delivery network. If you do \u2013 and we will be the judge \u2013 or if you do anything illegal, in addition to any other legal rights we may have, we will ban you along with the site you're hotlinking from, delete all your images, report you to the authorities if necessary, and prevent you from viewing any images hosted on Imgur.com. We mean it.\nPlease have tons of fun! That's what Imgur is all about.  If something isn't fun -- if you see anything on our site that shouldn't be there because it violates our policies, is illegal (e.g. revenge porn or child porn),  or for some other reason, please let us know by emailing us at abuse@imgur.com.\nYou can upload images anonymously and share them online with only the people you choose to share them with. If you make them publicly available, they may be featured in the gallery. If you share an image publicly with Facebook, Twitter, Digg, Reddit, etc., then it may end up in the gallery.\nVersion 3.3 09/08/2015\nBy uploading a file or other content or by making a comment, you represent and warrant to us that (1) doing so does not violate or infringe anyone else's rights; and (2) you created the file or other content you are uploading, or otherwise have sufficient intellectual property rights to upload the material consistent with these terms. With regard to any file or content you upload to the public portions of our site, you grant Imgur a non-exclusive, royalty-free, perpetual, irrevocable worldwide license (with sublicense and assignment rights) to use, to display online and in any present or future media, to create derivative works of, to allow downloads of, and/or distribute any such file or content. To the extent that you delete any such file or content from the public portions of our site, the license you grant to Imgur pursuant to the preceding sentence will automatically terminate, but will not be revoked with respect to any file or content Imgur has already copied and sublicensed or designated for sublicense. Also, of course, anything you post to a public portion of our site may be used by the public pursuant to the following paragraph even after you delete it.\nBy downloading an image or copying other user-generated content (UGC) from Imgur, you agree that  you do not claim any rights to it. The following conditions apply:\n---You may use UGC for personal, non-commercial purposes.\n---You may use UGC for anything that qualifies as fair use under copyright law, for example journalism (news, comment, criticism, etc.), but please include an attribute (\"Imgur\" or \"courtesy of Imgur\") next to where it is displayed.\n---You may not use UGC for non-journalistic commercial purposes.\n---Your use of UGC is at your own risk.  IMGUR MAKES NO WARRANTIES OF NON-INFRINGEMENT, and you will indemnify and hold Imgur harmless from any copyright infringement claims arising out of your use of the UGC. (See our general disclaimers below.)\nYou may not copy or use any portions of our site that are not UGC except within the limits of fair use.\nIf you see anything on our site that you believe infringes your copyright rights, you may notify our Digital Millennium Copyright Act (\"DMCA\") agent by sending the following information:\n---Identification of the copyrighted work or works claimed to have been infringed. IMPORTANT: you must have a registered copyright for the work, or at least have filed with the Copyright Office (http://www.copyright.gov/eco/) an application to register a copyright for the work. DMCA notifications based on unregistered works are not valid.\n---Identification of the material on our servers that is claimed to be infringing and that is to be removed, including the URL or other information to enable us to locate the material.\n---A statement that you have a good faith belief that use of the material in the manner complained of is not authorized by you as copyright owner, or by your agent, or by law.\n---A statement that the information in your notice is accurate, and under penalty of perjury, that you are the owner (or authorized to act on behalf of the owner) of the exclusive copyright right that is allegedly being infringed.\n---Your physical or electronic signature, or of someone authorized to act on your behalf.\n---Instructions on how we may contact you: preferably email, but also address and phone.\nBecause a DMCA takedown notice, to be valid, must be based on a work for which the copyright is registered with the Copyright Office (or for which registration has been applied for), and because a high percentage of DMCA takedown notices are not valid. It will speed our investigation of your DMCA notice if you attach to it a copy of your copyright registration, or registration application, for the work.\nOur agent to receive such notifications of claimed infringement is Alan Schaaf.\nEmail:\nabuse@imgur.com\nMailing Address:\nImgur Inc.\n                415 Jackson Street, Ste. 200\n                San Francisco, CA 94111\nUse the same procedure for any claimed trademark violations or other infringements. If we receive a DMCA takedown demand for material you posted that we believe constitutes fair use, we will attempt to notify you if we have your contact info; otherwise we are under no obligation to notify you regarding the removal. We reserve the right to refuse to remove any material that in our view constitutes fair use. If we identify you as a \"repeat infringer,\" we will block or remove your images and terminate any accounts you have with us. (If we notify you of a DMCA removal and you respond with a legitimate counter-notice, that won't count toward being a repeat infringer.) Keep in mind that we reserve the right to remove any content at any time whether or not it infringes or violates any of our policies.\n            Any uses of our name, trademarks, and logos must follow our\n            Trademark Use Policy.\n        \nAlthough of course we strive to make Imgur as dependable as possible, Imgur's services are provided on an AS IS \u2013 WITH ALL FAULTS basis. Your use of our service is entirely at your own risk. We do not guarantee the availability of our service at any given time, or the reliability of our service when it is running. We do not guarantee the integrity of, or the continued availability of, files on our servers. Whether we make backups, and if so, whether restoration of those backups will be available to you, is at our discretion. IMGUR DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES, EXPRESS AND IMPLIED, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF FITNESS AND MERCHANTABILITY. NOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING ELSE STATED IN THESE TERMS, AND IRRESPECTIVE OF WHETHER IMGUR TAKES OR DOES NOT TAKE MEASURES TO REMOVE INAPPROPRIATE OR HARMFUL CONTENT FROM ITS SITE, IMGUR HAS NO DUTY TO MONITOR ANY CONTENT ON ITS SITE. IMGUR DOES NOT ASSUME RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE ACCURACY, APPROPRIATENESS, OR HARMLESSNESS OF ANY CONTENT APPEARING ON IMGUR.COM THAT IS NOT PRODUCED BY IMGUR, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO USER CONTENT, ADVERTISING CONTENT, OR OTHERWISE.\nYour sole remedy for the loss of any services and/or of any images or other data you may have stored on Imgur's service is to discontinue your use of our service. IMGUR WILL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF YOUR USE OF, OR INABILITY TO USE, IMGUR'S SERVICES, EVEN IF IMGUR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF OR REASONABLY SHOULD HAVE KNOWN OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. NO CAUSE OF ACTION ARISING OUT OF YOUR USE OF IMGUR'S SERVICES MAY BE BROUGHT MORE THAN ONE YEAR AFTER IT OCCURS.\nYOU WILL INDEMNIFY AND HOLD IMGUR AND ALL OF ITS PERSONNEL HARMLESS FROM ALL LOSS, LIABILITY, CLAIMS, DAMAGES AND EXPENSES, INCLUDING REASONABLE ATTORNEY FEES, ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO YOUR VIOLATION OF THESE TERMS, YOUR INFRINGEMENT OF ANY THIRD PARTY'S RIGHTS, AND ANY HARM CAUSED TO ANY THIRD PARTY AS A RESULT OF YOUR UPLOADING OF FILES, COMMENTS, OR ANYTHING ELSE TO OUR SERVERS.\n\"Imgur\" or \"we\" refers to Imgur, Inc., a Delaware corporation, and its successors and assigns. \"You\" refers to any person who has consented to these terms or has become contractually bound to them, whether such person is identified or not at the time. These terms are governed by California law, excluding its conflicts of law principles, and if there is a lawsuit between you and Imgur, jurisdiction and venue will lie exclusively in the State where the defendant is located, if within the United States, or in Santa Clara County, California otherwise. If any part of these terms is invalid, the remaining provisions will be unaffected. These Terms of Use constitute the entire agreement among the parties relating to this subject matter, and they will continue to govern any issues that arise out of your use of Imgur's services even after you discontinue using them. We may revise these terms from time to time without notice. Whenever we do so, we will so indicate by changing the version date at the top. Any changes apply as of the time they are posted. Imgur is not meant for use by children under age 13; if your child is younger than 13 please allow him or her to use it only under your supervision. \nParental control protections (such as computer hardware, software, or filtering services) are commercially available that may assist you in limiting access to material that is harmful to minors.

A Visitor may be asked to accept these Terms in order to use a certain limited number of features on the Service, such as requesting a full-text or other content made available on the Service, or applying for a job. The Terms become binding once we accept your offer to enter into a binding agreement with us, e.g., once you have submitted the registration process and we have sent confirmation that you have successfully registered for the Service.

Cardinal contractual duties are an abstract description of those obligations whose fulfilment is indispensable for the proper implementation of an agreement and on whose fulfilment the contracting parties can usually rely. Any other liability on the part of ResearchGate is excluded.12. IndemnityYou will indemnify and hold ResearchGate (including our affiliates and subsidiaries, as well as our and their respective officers, directors, employees, agents) harmless from any claim or demand, including reasonable legal fees, made by any third party due to or arising out of your breach of these Terms, your improper use of the Service, or your breach of any law or your violation of the rights of a third party.13.

Some laws do not allow the limitation or exclusion of liability, so these limits may not apply to you. However, if you are a resident of the State of New Jersey, these limitations and exclusions do apply to you.If you have a dispute with one or more Users, you release us (and our affiliates and subsidiaries, and our and their respective officers, directors, employees and agents) from claims, demands, and damages (actual and consequential) of every kind and nature, known and unknown, arising out of or in any way connected with such disputes. In entering into this release, you expressly waive any protections (whether statutory or otherwise) that would otherwise limit the coverage of this release to include only those claims which you may know or suspect to exist in your favor at the time of agreeing to this release.17. Agreement to arbitrate, class action waiver and releaseThis section only applies to Users in the United States.PLEASE READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY \u2013 IT MAY SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECT YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS, INCLUDING YOUR RIGHT TO FILE A LAWSUIT IN COURT AND TO HAVE A JURY HEAR YOUR CLAIMS. In order to expedite and control the cost of disputes, you and we agree that any legal or equitable claim arising out of or relating in any way to your use of the Service or these Terms, and the formation, validity, enforceability, scope, or applicability of these Terms, including this Section 17 (referred to as a \u201cClaim\u201d) will be resolved as follows:Informal Resolution.\u00a0We will first try to resolve any Claim informally. Accordingly, neither of us may start a formal proceeding (except for Claims described in the \u201cExceptions\u201d section below) for at least 30 days after one of us notifies the other of a Claim in writing. Notice of the Claim will include a brief written statement that sets forth the name, address, and contact information of the party giving it, the facts giving rise to the dispute, claim, or controversy and the relief requested. You will send your notice by email to copyright@researchgate.net AND to this address: ResearchGate GmbH, Chausseestr. 20, 10115 Berlin, Germany. We will send your notice by email to the email address associated with your account. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the notice and 30-day negotiation period required by this paragraph shall not apply, however, to disputes, claims, or controversies concerning patents, copyrights, moral rights, trademarks, and trade secrets and claims of piracy or unauthorized use of the Service.Formal Resolution.\u00a0Except as provided in the \u201cExceptions\u201d section below, if we cannot resolve a Claim informally, any Claim either of us asserts will be resolved only by binding arbitration and not in courts of general jurisdiction. The arbitration will be conducted under the rules of JAMS that are in effect at the time the arbitration is initiated (referred to as the \u201cJAMS Rules\u201d) and under the rules set forth in these Terms. If there is a conflict between JAMS Rules and the rules set forth in these Terms, the rules set forth in these Terms will govern. ARBITRATION MEANS THAT YOU WAIVE YOUR RIGHT TO A JURY TRIAL. You may, in arbitration, seek any and all remedies otherwise available to you pursuant to your state\u2019s law.(a) Personal Users. If you are a User who uses the Service solely for your own personal, non-commercial use, and not in a professional capacity and you decide to initiate arbitration on your own behalf as a living person (\u201cPersonal User\u201d), we agree to reimburse your arbitration initiation fee, and any additional deposit required by JAMS to initiate your arbitration. We also agree to pay the costs of the arbitration proceeding. Other fees, such as attorney\u2019s fees and expenses of travel to the arbitration, will be paid in accordance with JAMS Rules. The arbitration will be held at a location in your hometown area unless you and we both agree to another location or telephonic arbitration. To start an arbitration, you or we must do the following things:---Write a Demand for Arbitration. The demand must include a description of the Claim and the amount of damages sought to be recovered. You can find a copy of a Demand for Arbitration at www.jamsadr.com.---Send three copies of the Demand for Arbitration, plus the appropriate filing fee, to: JAMS, 500 North State College Blvd., Suite 600, Orange, CA 92868 (1-800-352-5267).---Send one copy of the Demand for Arbitration to us at: ResearchGate GmbH, Chausseestr. 20, 10115 Berlin, Germany.(b) Professional Users. If you are a User who uses the Service in a professional capacity in connection with an educational institution or legal entity (\u201cProfessional User\u201d) and you decide to initiate arbitration associated with your professional use of the Service, you will be required to pay the arbitration initiation fee as well as any additional deposit required by JAMS to initiate your arbitration. You also agree to pay the costs of the arbitration proceeding. Other fees, such as attorney\u2019s fees and expenses of travel to the arbitration, will be paid in accordance with JAMS Rules. The arbitration will be held in San Francisco, California, unless you and we both agree to another location or telephonic arbitration. To start an arbitration, you or we must do the following things:---Write a Demand for Arbitration. The demand must include a description of the Claim and the amount of damages sought to be recovered. You can find a copy of a Demand for Arbitration at www.jamsadr.com.---Send three copies of the Demand for Arbitration, plus the appropriate filing fee, to: JAMS, 500 North State College Blvd., Suite 600, Orange, CA 92868 (1-800-352-5267).---Send one copy of the Demand for Arbitration to us at ResearchGate GmbH, Chausseestr. 20, 10115 Berlin, Germany.Special Rules. In the arbitration proceeding, the arbitrator has no authority to make errors of law, and any award may be challenged if the arbitrator does so. Otherwise, the arbitrator\u2019s decision is final and binding on all parties and may be enforced in any federal or state court that has jurisdiction. Neither you nor we shall be entitled to join or consolidate claims in arbitration by or against other individuals or entities, or arbitrate any claim as a representative member of a class or in a private attorney general capacity. Accordingly, you and we agree that the JAMS Class Action Procedures do not apply to our arbitration. A court may sever any portion of Section 17 that it finds to be unenforceable, except for the prohibition on class, representative, and private attorney general arbitration.Exceptions.\u00a0Notwithstanding the foregoing, disputes, claims, or controversies concerning patents, copyrights, moral rights, trademarks, and trade secrets and claims of piracy or unauthorized use of the Service, including disputes involving a violation of the Communications Act of 1934, 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 605, or the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, 17 U.S.C. \u00a7 1201, or the Electronic Communications Privacy Act, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2510-2521, or any other statement or law governing theft of service, shall not be subject to arbitration as set out in this Section 17 and may be decided only by a court of competent jurisdiction. Moreover, you may choose to pursue your claim in small claims court where jurisdiction and venue over ResearchGate and you otherwise qualify for such small claims court and where your claim does not include a request for any type of equitable relief.Personal User right to opt out. If you are a Personal User, you have the right to opt out and not be bound by the binding arbitration requirement by sending written notice of your decision to opt out to the email address copyright@researchgate.net. The notice must be sent within 30 days of the effective date of these Terms or your first use of the Service, whichever is later. If you opt out of the binding arbitration requirement, we also will not be bound by the requirement. Professional Users may not opt out of the binding arbitration requirements.Changes to this section. We will provide 30 days\u2019 notice of any changes to this section. Changes will become effective on the 30th day, and will apply prospectively only to any claims arising after the 30th day.18. Applicable lawThe U.S. Federal Arbitration Act (including its procedural provisions) is the law that will be applied to determine whether Section 17 can be enforced and how it should be interpreted.Apart from that, if you are a United States resident, these Terms and our relationship will be governed by Californian law, except for its conflicts of laws principles.19. Venue for legal disputes not subject to arbitrationIf you are a United States resident, judicial proceedings that are excluded from the Arbitration Agreement in Section 17 must be brought in state or federal court in San Francisco, California, unless we both agree to some other location. You and ResearchGate both consent to venue and personal jurisdiction in San Francisco, California.\norJoin for freeLog in\n"

    "https://www.tumblr.com/policy/en/terms-of-service": "   Tumblr                          Tumblr is a U.S. company and subject to U.S. laws and jurisdiction. The original version of these Terms of Service (and any other terms, policies, or guidelines that we provide to you) are written in English. To the extent any translated version of these Terms of Service (or any other terms, policies, or guidelines that we provide to you) conflicts with the English version, the English version controls.\n    \n        THESE TERMS OF SERVICE CONTAIN LIMITATIONS OF TUMBLR'S LIABILITY IN\n        SECTION 14.\n    \n    Hello! Welcome to Tumblr\u2019s Terms of Service. Please read this carefully\n    before using our site, services, or products. This is a contract between\n    you and Tumblr. We've also included several annotations that aren't a part\n    of the contract itself, but are intended to emphasize key sections and help\n    you follow the text. We\u2019ve tried to be fair and straightforward. Please\n    feel free to contact us if you\n    have any questions or suggestions!\n    Please read these Terms of Service and our Community Guidelines\n    (collectively, the \"Agreement\") carefully before using\n    tumblr.com (the \"Site\") and/or the other domains,\n    websites, products, applications, mobile applications, services, and/or\n    Content provided by Tumblr, Inc. (all of those collectively with the Site,\n    the \"Services\") (Tumblr, Inc., a Delaware corporation and\n    wholly-owned subsidiary of Oath Inc., a Delaware corporation (\"    Oath\"), collectively with its agents, representatives,\n    consultants, employees, officers, and directors, \"Tumblr,\"\n    \"we,\" or \"us\"). By using or accessing the\n    Services, you (\"Subscriber\" or \"you\")\n    agree to be bound by all the terms and conditions of this Agreement. If you\n    don\u2019t agree to all the terms and conditions of this Agreement, you\n    shouldn't, and aren't permitted to, use the Services. Tumblr\u2019s personalized\n    Services cannot be provided and the terms of this Agreement cannot be\n    performed without Tumblr processing information about you and other users.\n    Processing of the information you share with Tumblr is essential to the\n    personalized Services which we provide and which you expect, including\n    personalized Content (as described below) and ads, and is a necessary part\n    of our performance of the agreement we have with you.\n    We\u2019re just letting you know, here, that Tumblr is now part of Oath, a\n    digital and mobile media company with more than 50    brands globally, and a\n    member of the Verizon family of companies, and these\n    \n        Terms of Service\n    \n    , which apply to your use of Tumblr, have been updated to reflect this\n    change. This section also includes an agreement where you're agreeing to\n    agree to the terms of this Agreement.\n    Tumblr reserves the right to modify this Agreement by (1) posting a revised\n    Agreement on and/or through the Services and (2) providing notice to you\n    that this Agreement has changed, generally via email where practicable, and\n    otherwise through the Services (such as through a notification on your\n    Tumblr Dashboard or in our mobile applications). Modifications will not\n    apply retroactively. You are responsible for reviewing and becoming\n    familiar with any modifications to this Agreement.\n    We may sometimes ask you to review and to explicitly agree to (or reject) a\n    revised version of this Agreement. In such cases, modifications will be\n    effective at the time of your agreement to the modified version of this\n    Agreement. If you do not agree at that time, you are not permitted to use\n    the Services.\n    In cases where we do not ask for your explicit agreement to a modified\n    version of this Agreement, but otherwise provide notice as set forth above,\n    the modified version of this Agreement will become effective fourteen days\n    after we have posted the modified Agreement and provided you notification\n    of the modifications. Your use of the Services following that period\n    constitutes your acceptance of the terms and conditions of this Agreement\n    as modified. If you do not agree to the modifications, you are not\n    permitted to use, and should discontinue your use of, the Services.\n    Note that, if you have prepaid for any Paid Services (as defined below)\n    prior to a modification of this Agreement, your use of such prepaid Paid\n    Services is governed by the version of this Agreement in effect at the time\n    Tumblr received your prepayment.\n    As Tumblr grows and improves, we might have to make changes to these Terms\n    of Service. When we do, we'll let you know. We're also going to make it a\n    practice to post old versions so it's easy to see\n    changes/additions/deletions. To see old versions, scroll down to the end of\n    this document.\nEligibility:\n    You  may not use the Services, provide any personal information to Tumblr,\n    or otherwise submit personal information through the Services (including,\n    for example, a name, address, telephone number, or email address) if you\n    are under the Minimum Age. The Minimum Age is (i) thirteen (13), or (ii)\n    for users in the European Union, sixteen (16) (or the lower age that your\n    country has provided for you to consent to the processing of your personal\n    data) . You may only use the Services if you can form a binding contract\n    with Tumblr and are not legally prohibited from using the Services.\n    You have to be the Minimum Age to use Tumblr. We're serious: it's a hard\n    rule. \u201cBut I\u2019m, like, almost old enough!\u201d you plead. Nope, sorry. If\n    you're not old enough, don't use Tumblr. Ask your parents for a\n    Playstation 4, or try books.\nService Changes and Limitations:\n    The Services change frequently, and their form and functionality may change\n    without prior notice to you. Tumblr retains the right to create limits on\n    and related to use of the Services in its sole discretion at any time with\n    or without notice. Tumblr may also impose limits on certain Services or\n    aspects of those Services or restrict your access to parts or all of the\n    Services without notice or liability. Tumblr may change, suspend, or\n    discontinue any or all of the Services at any time, including the\n    availability of any product, feature, database, or Content (as defined\n    below). Tumblr may also terminate or suspend Accounts (as defined below) at\n    any time, in its sole discretion.\n    Tumblr is an ever-evolving platform. With new products, services, and\n    features launching all the time, we need flexibility to make changes,\n    impose limits, and occasionally suspend or terminate certain offerings\n    (like features that flop). We can also terminate or suspend any account at\n    any time. That sounds harsh, but we only use that power when we have a\n    reason, as outlined in these Terms of Service, our\n    \n        Privacy Policy\n    \n    , and our    Community Guidelines.\nLimitations on Automated Use:\n    You may not, without express prior written permission, do any of the\n    following while accessing or using the Services: (a) tamper with, or use\n    non-public areas of the Services, or the computer or delivery systems of\n    Tumblr and/or its service providers; (b) probe, scan, or test any system or\n    network (particularly for vulnerabilities), or otherwise attempt to breach\n    or circumvent any security or authentication measures; (c) access or search\n    or attempt to access or search the Services by any means (automated or\n    otherwise) other than through our currently available, published interfaces\n    that are provided by Tumblr (and only pursuant to those terms and\n    conditions) or unless permitted by Tumblr's robots.txt file or other robot\n    exclusion mechanisms; (d) scrape the Services, and particularly scrape\n    Content (as defined below) from the Services; (e) use the Services to send\n    altered, deceptive, or false source-identifying information, including\n    without limitation by forging TCP-IP packet headers or email headers; or\n    (f) interfere with, or disrupt, (or attempt to do so), the access of any\n    Subscriber, host or network, including, without limitation, by sending a\n    virus to, spamming, or overloading the Services, or by scripted use of the\n    Services in such a manner as to interfere with or create an undue burden on\n    the Services.\n    Don't do bad things to Tumblr or to other users. Some particularly\n    egregious examples of \"bad things\" are listed in this section.\n    As a condition to using certain of the Services and in order for us to\n    provide them to you, you may be required to create an account (an \"    Account\"), provide your age and an email address and\n    select a password and Tumblr username, which will serve as a default link\n    to your default Tumblr blog of the form [username].tumblr.com (a \"    Tumblr URL\"). You must select a different Tumblr URL for\n    each new blog you create.\n    You agree to provide Tumblr with accurate, complete, and updated\n    registration information, particularly your email address.\n    It's really important that the email address associated with your Tumblr\n    account is accurate and up-to-date. If you ever forget your password - or\n    worse, fall victim to a malicious phishing attack - a working email address\n    is often the only way for us to recover your account.\n    You are also responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your\n    Account password and for the security of your Account, and you will notify\n    Tumblr immediately of any actual or suspected loss, theft, or unauthorized\n    use of your Account or Account password.\n    For information about how Tumblr collects, uses, and shares your\n    information, please review our\n    \n        Privacy Policy\n    \n    . By using the Services you agree you have read the Privacy Policy, which\n    describes our collection, use, and sharing (as set forth in the Privacy\n    Policy) of such information, including the transfer of this information to\n    the United States and/or other countries for storage, processing, and use\n    by Tumblr and the Tumblr Affiliates (as defined below).\nDefinitions:\n    For purposes of this Agreement: (1) the term \"Content\"\n    means a creative expression and includes, without limitation, video, audio,\n    photographs, images, illustrations, animations, logos, tools, written\n    posts, replies, comments, information, data, text, software, scripts,\n    executable files, graphics, Themes (as defined below), and interactive\n    features, any of which may be generated, provided, or otherwise made\n    accessible on or through the Services; (2) the term \"    Subscriber Content\" means Content that a Subscriber\n    submits, transfers, or otherwise provides to the Services. Content\n    includes, without limitation, all Subscriber Content.\nYour Rights in Subscriber Content:\n    Subscribers retain ownership and/or other applicable rights in Subscriber\n    Content, and Tumblr and/or third parties retain ownership and/or other\n    applicable rights in all Content other than Subscriber Content.\n    You retain ownership you have of any intellectual property you post to\n    Tumblr.\nSubscriber Content License to Tumblr:\n    When you provide Subscriber Content to Tumblr through the Services, you\n    grant Tumblr a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free, sublicensable,\n    transferable right and license to use, host, store, cache, reproduce,\n    publish, display (publicly or otherwise), perform (publicly or otherwise),\n    distribute, transmit, modify, adapt (including, without limitation, in\n    order to conform it to the requirements of any networks, devices, services,\n    or media through which the Services are available), and create derivative\n    works of, such Subscriber Content. The rights you grant in this license are\n    for the limited purposes of allowing Tumblr to operate the Services in\n    accordance with their functionality, improve and promote the Services, and\n    develop new Services. The reference in this license to \"creat[ing]\n    derivative works\" is not intended to give Tumblr a right to make\n    substantive editorial changes or derivations, but does, for example, enable    reblogging, which allows Tumblr Subscribers to\n    redistribute Subscriber Content from one Tumblr blog to another in a manner\n    that allows them to add their own text or other Content before or after\n    your Subscriber Content.\n    When you upload your creations to Tumblr, you\u2019re giving us permission to\n    make them available in all the ways you would expect us to (for example,\n    via your blog, RSS, the Tumblr Dashboard, etc.). We never want to do\n    anything with your work that surprises you.\n    Something else worth noting: Countless Tumblr blogs have gone on to spawn\n    books, films, albums, brands, and more. Any royalties or reimbursement you\n    get for your creations are, needless to say, entirely yours. It's your\n    work, and we're proud to be a part (however small) of what you accomplish.\n    You also agree that this license includes the right for Tumblr to make all\n    publicly-posted Content available to third parties selected by Tumblr, so\n    that those third parties can syndicate and/or analyze such Content on other\n    media and services.\n    An example of what it means to \"make all publicly-posted Content available\"\n    to a Tumblr partner for distribution or analysis would be licensing the\n    Tumblr \"firehose,\" a live feed of all public activity on Tumblr, to\n    partners like search engines.\n    Note also that this license to your Subscriber Content continues even if\n    you stop using the Services, primarily because of the social nature of\n    Content shared through Tumblr\u2019s Services - when you post something\n    publicly, others may choose to comment on it, making your Content part of a\n    social conversation that can\u2019t later be erased without retroactively\n    censoring the speech of others.\n    One thing you should consider before posting: When you make something\n    publicly available on the Internet, it becomes practically impossible to\n    take down all copies of it.\n    You also agree that you will respect the intellectual property rights of\n    others, and represent and warrant that you have all of the necessary rights\n    to grant us this license for all Subscriber Content you transfer to us.\n    Tumblr may add its own affiliate code to links posted on Tumblr at its\n    discretion, provided a user has not previously included their own affiliate\n    code into the applicable link. Users may opt out of this functionality    here.\nContent License to You:\n    As a Subscriber of the Services, Tumblr grants you a worldwide, revocable,\n    non-exclusive, non-sublicensable, and non-transferable license to download,\n    store, view, display, perform, redistribute, and create derivative works of\n    Content solely in connection with your use of, and in strict accordance\n    with the functionality and restrictions of, the Services (including,\n    without limitation, Paid Services, as defined below). This means, for\n    example, that we license Content to you for purposes of reblogging.\nCompliance with Community Guidelines:\n    You agree that you won't violate Tumblr's    Community Guidelines.\nTermination and Deletion:\n    On termination of your Account, or upon your deletion of particular pieces\n    of Subscriber Content from the Services, Tumblr shall make reasonable\n    efforts to make such Subscriber Content inaccessible and cease use of it\n    and, if required by the applicable Privacy Policy, delete your Account data\n    and / or Subscriber Content unless permitted or required to keep this data\n    in accordance with law; however, you acknowledge and agree that: (a)\n    deleted Subscriber Content may persist in caches or backups for a\n    reasonable period of time and (b) copies of or references to the Subscriber\n    Content may not be entirely removed (due to the nature of reblogging, for\n    example). You can delete your account at any time    here.\n    If you develop software or services based on the Services or any Content,\n    whether using the\n    \n        Tumblr Application Programming Interface\n    \n    or not, you will agree to and comply with the\n    \n        Tumblr Application Developer and API License Agreement\n    \n    .\n    Any use of Tumblr's trademarks, branding, logos, and other such assets in\n    connection with the Services shall use    Tumblr\u2019s approved branding and\n    shall be in accordance with the\n    \n        Tumblr Trademark Guidelines\n    \n    .\n    Tumblr makes available specialized HTML and CSS code (\"    Tumblr Template Code\") for the design and layout of blog\n    pages available for use on some of the Services (\"Themes\n    \"). Certain Themes are available for purchase as a Paid Service (as defined\n    below) (such Themes, \"Premium Themes\"). Purchased Premium\n    Themes may not be transferred between Accounts, between blogs, or between\n    Services on a single Account and are subject to the payment terms herein.\n    Tumblr grants you a license to customize the Tumblr Template Code to create\n    your own Themes for use on your blog page (each a \"    Custom Theme\"). If you choose, you may also contribute\n    your Custom Themes for use by other Subscribers as Subscriber Content.\n    However, as a condition of this license allowing you to create Custom\n    Themes, you agree that you won't distribute such Custom Themes from\n    locations other than Tumblr-owned or approved websites without our\n    permission, as set out in our    Community Guidelines.\n    Note also that other Subscribers may use your Custom Themes after you have\n    removed them from distribution, and you hereby grant those Subscribers an\n    irrevocable license to use those Custom Themes as contributed by you. In\n    other words, you can remove and stop distribution of your Custom Themes,\n    but Subscribers who are already using them can keep using them.\n    To develop and distribute Custom Themes that are Premium Themes, please    contact us.\n    Some of the Services require payment of fees (the \"    Paid Services,\" including without limitation Premium\n    Themes). All fees are stated in United States dollars. You shall pay all\n    applicable fees, as described in the applicable Services, in connection\n    with such Services, and any related taxes or additional charges.\n    Paid Services are limited licenses for you to use particular for-pay\n    aspects of the Services. Usage of terms like sell, sale, buy, purchase, or\n    similar terms all refer to your acquisition of a license to use Paid\n    Services, and do not represent any transfer of any right, title, or\n    ownership interest of any kind. You may not relicense, resell, transfer, or\n    exchange Paid Services within or outside of the Services, except as\n    expressly allowed by the rules of those Paid Services.\n    Tumblr may, in its sole discretion, modify the functionality of, or\n    eliminate, Paid Services, or the terms and conditions under which Paid\n    Services are provided.\n    Purchases of Paid Services are final and non-refundable (particularly those\n    Paid Services that may be used immediately, such as Promotions, as defined\n    below), except at Tumblr's sole discretion and in accordance with the rules\n    governing each Paid Service. Termination of your Account or your rights\n    under this Agreement may result in forfeiture of purchased Paid Services.\n    For example, if your Account is suspended, you forfeit your license to any\n    Premium Themes you have purchased.\n    Tumblr may change its prices for Paid Services at any time. To the extent\n    applicable, Tumblr will provide you reasonable notice of any such pricing\n    changes by posting the new prices on or through the applicable Paid Service\n    and/or by sending you an email notification. If you do not wish to pay the\n    new prices, you may choose not to purchase, or to cancel, the applicable\n    Paid Service prior to the change going into effect.\n    Some features of the Services may allow you to promote yourself to other\n    Subscribers, and some of these features may be Paid Services (\"    Promotions\").\n    The following additional terms apply to Promotions:\n    Things that you promote will comply with this Agreement; if they don't,\n    Tumblr reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to cancel a Promotion\n    without refund or recourse to you.\n    Tumblr may remove or disable any Promotion for any reason in its sole\n    discretion.\n    Unless otherwise specified, Tumblr does not guarantee any activity that\n    Promotions may receive, including but not limited to clicks, Likes, and\n    Reblogs. Tumblr cannot control how Subscribers interact with Promotions and\n    is not responsible for \"click fraud\" or other fraudulent actions by third\n    parties, including, without limitation, Subscribers. Tumblr doesn't\n    guarantee that its reporting related to Promotions will be accurate or\n    complete, nor does it guarantee that Promotions will behave in a particular\n    manner, and Tumblr shall not be liable to you or responsible for any\n    erroneous reporting about or errant behavior of or related to Promotions\n    (e.g., any errors in how Likes or Reblogs are counted).\n    Promotions may allow targeting to some Subscriber characteristics. Tumblr\n    does not guarantee that any particular Promotion will reach a particular\n    sort of individual in all cases.\n    You can cancel certain Promotions at any time depending on their\n    functionality, but you are responsible for paying for Promotions at least\n    to the extent they have already been used or distributed through the\n    Services.\n    By submitting a Promotion, you license Tumblr to run that Promotion for as\n    long as you have specified, which, depending on the Promotion, may be\n    perpetually. This license ends when the Promotion has been completed or\n    cancelled, but it may take up to forty eight (48) hours for a Promotion to\n    stop being reflected on the Services.\n    Your access to and use of the Services or any Content is at your own risk.\n    YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT THE SERVICES ARE PROVIDED TO YOU ON AN \"AS\n    IS\" AND \"AS AVAILABLE\" BASIS. WITHOUT LIMITING THE FOREGOING, TO THE FULL\n    EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, TUMBLR DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR\n    IMPLIED, OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, OR\n    NON-INFRINGEMENT. Tumblr makes no representations or warranties of any kind\n    with respect to the Services, including any representation or warranty that\n    the use of the Services will (a) be timely, uninterrupted or error-free or\n    operate in combination with any other hardware, software, system, or data,\n    (b) meet your requirements or expectations, (c) be free from errors or that\n    defects will be corrected, (d) be free of viruses or other harmful\n    components; or (e) be entirely secure or that the information you share\n    with us will be secure. Tumblr also makes no representations or warranties\n    of any kind with respect to Content; Subscriber Content, in particular, is\n    provided by and is solely the responsibility of, the Subscribers providing\n    that Content. No advice or information, whether oral or written, obtained\n    from Tumblr or through the Services, will create any warranty not expressly\n    made herein.\n    You agree that any claim you may have arising out of or related to this\n    Agreement or your relationship with Tumblr must be filed within one year\n    after such claim arose; otherwise, your claim is permanently barred.\n    You further release, to the fullest extent permitted by law, Tumblr and its\n    employees, agents, consultants, directors, shareholders, any other person\n    or entity that directly or indirectly controls, is under common control\n    with, or is directly or indirectly controlled by, Tumblr (the \u201cTumblr\n    Affiliates\u201d) from responsibility, liability, claims, demands, and/or\n    damages (actual and consequential) of every kind and nature, known and\n    unknown (including but not limited to claims of negligence), arising out of\n    or related to the following:\n    Disputes between Subscribers, including those between you and other\n    Subscribers.\n    The acts of third parties generally (i.e., individuals or entities who are\n    not Tumblr or a Tumblr Affiliate), including third party sites and\n    services.\n    Disputes concerning any use of or action taken using your Account by you or\n    a third party.\n    Claims relating to the unauthorized access to any data communications\n    relating to, or Content stored under or relating to, your Account,\n    including but not limited to unauthorized interception, use, or alteration\n    of such communications or your Content. For the sake of clarity, this\n    includes any and all claims related to the security of your Account\n    credentials.\n    Claims relating to any face-to-face meetings in any way related to Tumblr\n    at any venues (\"Meetups\"), including without limitation\n    claims related to the actions or omissions of any Subscribers or third\n    parties who organize, attend, or are otherwise involved in any Meetups; see\n    our Meetups page for more\n    information. Unless otherwise expressly disclosed in writing, Tumblr does\n    not sponsor, oversee, or in any manner control Meetups.\n    If you are a California resident, you waive California Civil Code \u00a7 1542,\n    which says: \"A general release does not extend to claims which the creditor\n    does not know or suspect to exist in his favor at the time of executing the\n    release, which if known by him must have materially affected his settlement\n    with the debtor.\"\n    TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, TUMBLR AND THE TUMBLR\n    AFFILIATES SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR: (A) ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, EXEMPLARY\n    PUNITIVE, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY KIND WHATSOEVER; (B) LOSS OF:\n    PROFITS, REVENUE, DATA, USE, GOODWILL, OR OTHER INTANGIBLE LOSSES; (C)\n    DAMAGES RELATING TO YOUR ACCESS TO, USE OF, OR INABILITY TO ACCESS OR USE\n    THE SERVICES; (D) DAMAGES RELATING TO ANY CONDUCT OR CONTENT OF ANY THIRD\n    PARTY OR SUBSCRIBER USING THE SERVICES, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION,\n    DEFAMATORY, OFFENSIVE OR ILLEGAL CONDUCT OR CONTENT; AND/OR (E) DAMAGES IN\n    ANY MANNER RELATING TO ANY CONTENT. THIS LIMITATION APPLIES TO ALL CLAIMS,\n    WHETHER BASED ON WARRANTY, CONTRACT, TORT, OR ANY OTHER LEGAL THEORY,\n    WHETHER OR NOT TUMBLR HAS BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGE,\n    AND FURTHER WHERE A REMEDY SET FORTH HEREIN IS FOUND TO HAVE FAILED ITS\n    ESSENTIAL PURPOSE.\n    TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, THE TOTAL LIABILITY OF\n    TUMBLR AND THE TUMBLR AFFILIATES, FOR ANY CLAIM UNDER THIS AGREEMENT,\n    INCLUDING FOR ANY IMPLIED WARRANTIES, IS LIMITED TO THE GREATER OF ONE\n    HUNDRED DOLLARS (US $100.00) OR THE AMOUNT YOU PAID US TO USE THE\n    APPLICABLE SERVICE(S).\n    Some jurisdictions may not allow the exclusion of certain warranties or the\n    exclusion/limitation of liability as set forth in Section 14, so the\n    limitations above may not apply to you.\n    Either party may terminate this Agreement at any time by notifying the\n    other party. Tumblr may terminate or suspend your access to or ability to\n    use any and all Services immediately, without prior notice or liability,\n    for any reason or no reason, including but not limited to if you breach any\n    of the terms or conditions of this Agreement. In particular, Tumblr may\n    immediately terminate or suspend Accounts that have been flagged for repeat\n    copyright infringement.\n    Upon termination of your access to or ability to use a Service, including\n    but not limited to suspension of your Account on a Service, your right to\n    use or access that Service and any Content will immediately cease. All provisions\n    of this Agreement that by their nature should survive termination shall\n    survive termination, including, without limitation, ownership provisions,\n    warranty disclaimers, and limitations of liability. Termination of your\n    access to and use of the Services shall not relieve you of any obligations\n    arising or accruing prior to such termination or limit any liability that\n    you otherwise may have to Tumblr or any third party and shall not relieve\n    you of your rights if you are a user in the European Economic Area which\n    are described in the Privacy Policy.\n    You and Tumblr agree that we will resolve any claim or controversy at law\n    or equity that arises out of this Agreement or the Services in accordance\n    with this Section or as you and Tumblr otherwise agree in writing. Before\n    resorting to formal dispute resolution, we strongly encourage you to\n    contact us to seek a resolution.\nLaw and Forum for Legal Disputes:\n    This Agreement shall be governed in all respects by the laws of the State\n    of New York as they apply to agreements entered into and to be performed\n    entirely within New York between New York residents, without regard to\n    conflict of law provisions. You agree that any claim or dispute you may\n    have against Tumblr must be resolved exclusively by a state or federal\n    court located in New York County, New York, except as otherwise agreed by\n    the parties. You agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of the courts\n    located within New York County, New York for the purpose of litigating all\n    such claims or disputes.\n    If you are (a) a United States federal, state, or local government agency\n    or body, (b) using the Services in your official capacity, and (c) legally\n    unable to accept the clauses in this Section, then this Section doesn\u2019t\n    apply to you. For such entities, this Agreement and any related action will\n    be governed by the laws of the United States of America, without regard to\n    conflict of law provisions, and, in the absence of federal law and to the\n    extent permitted under federal law, the laws of the State of New York,\n    excluding choice of law.\n    This Agreement, as modified from time to time, constitutes the entire\n    agreement between you and Tumblr with respect to the subject matter hereof.\n    This Agreement replaces all prior or contemporaneous understandings or\n    agreements, written or oral, regarding the subject matter hereof and\n    constitutes the entire and exclusive agreement between the parties. The\n    failure of either party to exercise, in any way, any right provided for\n    herein shall not be deemed a waiver of any further rights hereunder. If any\n    provision of this Agreement is found to be unenforceable or invalid, that\n    provision shall be limited or eliminated to the minimum extent necessary so\n    that this Agreement shall otherwise remain enforceable and in full force\n    and effect. This Agreement is not assignable, transferable, or\n    sublicensable by you except with Tumblr's prior written consent. Tumblr may\n    assign this Agreement in whole or in part at any time without your consent.\n    No agency, partnership, joint controllership, joint venture, or employment\n    is created as a result of this Agreement and you do not have any authority\n    of any kind to bind Tumblr in any respect whatsoever. Any notice to Tumblr\n    that is required or permitted by this Agreement shall be in writing and\n    shall be deemed effective upon receipt, when delivered in person by\n    nationally recognized overnight courier or mailed by first class,\n    registered or certified mail, postage prepaid, to\n    ---Tumblr, Inc.---770 Broadway---New York, NY, 10003,---Attn: Legal Department\n    .\n    Tumblr provides global products and services and enables a global community\n    for individuals to share and follow the things they love. Tumblr's servers\n    and operations are, however, located in the United States, and Tumblr's\n    policies and procedures are based on United States law. As such, the\n    following provisions apply specifically to Subscribers located outside of\n    the United States: (1) you acknowledge that we will transfer, store, and\n    process your information, including but not limited to Subscriber Content\n    and any personal information, in the United States and/or other countries\n    in order to provide you with the Services and perform this Agreement; and\n    (2) if you are using the Services from a country embargoed by the United\n    States, or are on the United States Treasury Department's list of\n    \"Specially Designated Nationals,\" you agree that you will not engage in\n    financial transactions, or conduct any commercial activities using or\n    through the Services (for example, purchasing Premium Themes).\nSubmit an infringement notice\n    Tumblr has adopted the following policy toward copyright infringement on\n    the Services in accordance with the\n    \n        Digital Millennium Copyright Act\n    \n    (the \"DMCA\"). The address of Tumblr's Designated Agent for\n    copyright takedown notices (\"Designated Agent\") is listed\n    below. You may submit a notice under the DMCA using our    copyright notice form.\nReporting Instances of Copyright Infringement:\n    If you believe that Content residing or accessible on or through the\n    Services infringes a copyright, please send a notice of copyright\n    infringement containing the following information to the Designated Agent\n    at the address below:\n    Identification of the work or material being infringed.\n    Identification of the material that is claimed to be infringing, including\n    its location, with sufficient detail so that Tumblr is capable of finding\n    it and verifying its existence.\n    Contact information for the notifying party (the \"Notifying Party\"),\n    including name, address, telephone number, and email address.\n    A statement that the Notifying Party has a good faith belief that the\n    material is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent or law.\n    A statement made under penalty of perjury that the information provided in\n    the notice is accurate and that the Notifying Party is authorized to make\n    the complaint on behalf of the copyright owner.\n    A physical or electronic signature of a person authorized to act on behalf\n    of the owner of the copyright that has been allegedly infringed.\n    Please also note that the information provided in a notice of copyright\n    infringement may be forwarded to the Subscriber who posted the allegedly\n    infringing content. After removing material pursuant to a valid DMCA\n    notice, Tumblr will immediately notify the Subscriber responsible for the\n    allegedly infringing material that it has removed or disabled access to the\n    material. Tumblr will terminate, under appropriate circumstances, the\n    Accounts of Subscribers who are repeat copyright infringers, and reserves\n    the right, in its sole discretion, to terminate any Subscriber for actual\n    or apparent copyright infringement.\nSubmitting a DMCA Counter-Notification:\n    If you believe you are the wrongful subject of a DMCA notification, you may\n    file a counter-notification with Tumblr by providing the following\n    information to the Designated Agent at the address below:\n    The specific URLs of material that Tumblr has removed or to which Tumblr\n    has disabled access.\n    Your name, address, telephone number, and email address.\n    A statement that you consent to the jurisdiction of Federal District Court\n    for the judicial district in which your address is located (or the federal\n    district courts located in New York County, New York if your address is\n    outside of the United States), and that you will accept service of process\n    from the person who provided the original DMCA notification or an agent of\n    such person.\n    The following statement: \"I swear, under penalty of perjury, that I have a\n    good faith belief that the material was removed or disabled as a result of\n    a mistake or misidentification of the material to be removed or disabled.\"\n    Your signature.\n    Upon receipt of a valid counter-notification, Tumblr will forward it to\n    Notifying Party who submitted the original DMCA notification. The original\n    Notifying Party (or the copyright holder he or she represents) will then\n    have ten (10) days to notify us that he or she has filed legal action\n    relating to the allegedly infringing material. If Tumblr does not receive\n    any such notification within ten (10) days, we may restore the material to\n    the Services.\nDesignated Agent\n    Tumblr, Inc.\n    \n    770 Broadway\n    \n    New York, NY 10003\n    Attn:\n    Copyright Agent\n    Fax:\n    +1 (646) 513-4321\n    Email:\n    dmca@tumblr.com\nCopyright notice form:https://www.tumblr.com/dmca\n    You can find disclosures related to our use of open source software\n    packages at the following locations:\n        https://www.tumblr.com/policy/ios-credits\n    \n        https://www.tumblr.com/policy/android-credits\n    \n        https://www.tumblr.com/policy/web-credits\n    Link to Prior Versions\n    You will find prior versions of our Terms of Service on GitHub, which will\n    allow you to compare historical versions and see which terms have been\n    updated.\n    https://github.com/tumblr/policy/commits/master/terms-of-service.txt\n"

(\u201cVimeo,\u201d \u201cwe,\u201d \u201cus,\u201d or \u201cour\u201d) and you, our customer (\u201cyou\u201d or \u201cyour\u201d).

If you have a paid account, we commit to providing the core video hosting and streaming features of your plan (including the bandwidth and storage capabilities stated at the time of purchase) during your current service period. We reserve the right to charge for excessive use of bandwidth where plays occur on third-party sites and applications outside our embeddable video player or Apps.\nTransactions: We may offer digital goods for sale. Purchases of Vimeo On Demand videos are governed by our Vimeo On Demand Viewer Agreement.

Please have that person read this Agreement with you and consent to it before proceeding.\nParents and Guardians: By granting your child permission, you agree to the terms of this Agreement on behalf of your child. You are responsible for monitoring and supervising your child's usage. If your child is either under the applicable age or does not have your permission, please contact us immediately so that we can disable access.\nTeam Members: Certain subscription plans may allow you to grant other registered users (\u201cteam members\u201d) access to the account. Both you and each team member is deemed a party to this Agreement. You are responsible for the actions of your team members and must monitor their access and usage.\nAccount Security: You are responsible for all activity that occurs under your account, including unauthorized activity.

Advertised  prices and features may change.\nBasic and Plus Accounts: Vimeo Basic (free) members and Plus subscribers may not: (a) use the Services for commercial purposes unless they are film professionals or small film businesses; or (b) submit videos that they did not create or play a material part in creating.\nFees: You must pay all fees (plus any taxes) during your subscription period and any renewal periods. Our fees may include a fixed monthly or annual fee plus variable fees for transactions or usage.\nFree trials and Discounts: We may offer free-trial or discounted subscriptions. When a free-trial period ends, your paid subscription begins (unless you have cancelled) and you must pay the full monthly or annual fee. If we provide a discount for the first subscription period, you must pay the discounted fee; in any renewal, you must pay the full fee.\nRefund Policy: Subject to the terms hereof, Self-Serve subscribers who purchase plans directly from Vimeo may cancel and receive a full refund of their initial purchase with thirty (30) days after purchasing an annual plan and five (5) days after purchasing a monthly plan.

Unused storage, bandwidth, and other usage limits do not roll over.\nHow to Decline Renewal: Self-Serve customers may opt out of automatic renewal by changing their account settings. Enterprise customers may opt out according to the Enterprise Terms. Any opt-out or notice of non-renewal will not affect the current subscription period.

Any content in the account may be deleted to comply with the limitations of the new account status. You are responsible for archiving your content. Vimeo shall not be responsible for the loss of any content. We may publish additional guidelines regarding the treatment of lapsed subscriptions. These guidelines describe current practices only and shall not require Vimeo to provide any level of post-subscription account status.\nIn-App Purchase: We may allow you to purchase subscriptions within Apps. When you make such \u201cin-app\u201d purchases, you will be billed by the app platform, not us. To turn off automatic renewal for subscriptions, access your platform\u2019s account settings (not Vimeo\u2019s). Our refund policy does not apply to in-app purchases. Any billing inquiries should be directed to the app platform.\nWe may allow you to upload, live stream, submit, or publish (collectively, to \"submit\") content such as videos, recordings, images, and text (collectively, \"content\"). You must ensure that your content, and your conduct, complies with the Acceptable Use Policy set forth in this Section 5. Vimeo may (but is not obligated to) monitor your account, content, and conduct, regardless of your privacy settings. Vimeo may take all appropriate actions to enforce its rights including removing specific videos or suspending or removing your account.\nYou may only upload content that you have the right to upload and share. Copyright owners may send Vimeo a takedown notice as stated in our Copyright Policy if they believe Vimeo is hosting infringing materials.

If required by applicable law, you must provide closed captioning in your videos.\nWe may allow you to filter videos based upon their user-defined content rating. We cannot guarantee that videos will be appropriately rated by others. You must rate your videos appropriately.\nAs between you and Vimeo, you own and will retain ownership of all intellectual property rights in and to the content you submit. In order to allow Vimeo to host and stream your content, you grant Vimeo the permissions set forth below.\nBy submitting a video, you grant Vimeo permission to:\n---Stream the video to end users;\n---Embed the video on third-party websites;\n---Distribute the video via our APIs;\n---Make the video available for download;\n---Transcode the video (create compressed versions of your video file that are optimized for streaming); and\n---Generate stills (i.e., \u201cthumbnails\u201d) from your video to represent it (if you have not selected one).\nIf you have enabled a video privacy setting or disabled downloading or embedding, we will limit distribution of your video pursuant to your selection. By enabling access to your video to any third party, you grant each such person permission to stream (and/or download or embed, as applicable) your video. For the purposes of this Section 6.1, your video includes its title, description, tags, and other metadata.\nThe license period begins when you submit the video to Vimeo and ends when you or Vimeo delete it; provided that Vimeo may retain archival copies: (a) for a limited period of time in case you wish to restore it; (b) when the video is the subject of a takedown notice or other legal claim; or (c) when Vimeo in good faith believes that it is legally obligated to do so.\nYou grant Vimeo permission to use your name, likeness, biography, trademarks, logos, or other identifiers used by you in your account profile for the purpose of displaying such properties to the public or the audiences you have specified. You may revoke the foregoing permission by deleting your account.\nContent that is not covered by the licenses set forth in Sections 6.1 or 6.2 shall be governed by this Section 6.3 (e.g., text you submit in comments). You grant Vimeo a perpetual and irrevocable right and license to copy, transmit, distribute, publicly perform, and display such content through online means in connection with our Services. If you make suggestions to Vimeo on  improving or products or services, Vimeo may use your suggestions without any compensation to you.\nAll licenses granted by you in this Section 6: (a) are non-exclusive, worldwide, and royalty-free; (b) include the right and license to copy, use, distribute, publicly perform, and display the licensed work for the purposes stated above; and (c) include all necessary rights and licenses to allow us to exercise our rights and perform our obligations. By granting these licenses, you waive any so-called \u201cmoral rights\u201d that you may have. Nothing in this Agreement shall be deemed a license \u201ccondition\u201d applicable to Vimeo; rather, any breach of a term by Vimeo hereof shall give rise to, at most, a claim for breach of contract only.  All licenses granted herein are in addition to any other licenses that you may grant (e.g., a Creative Commons license).\nFor each piece of content that you submit to or through Vimeo, you represent and warrant that:\n---You have the right to submit the content to Vimeo and grant the licenses herein;\n---Vimeo will not need to obtain licenses from any third party or pay royalties to any third party with respect to the streaming or other permitted distribution of the content;\n---The content does not, and will not, infringe any third party's rights, including intellectual property rights and privacy rights; and\n---The content complies with this Agreement and all applicable laws.\nYou will indemnify, defend, and hold harmless Vimeo and its subsidiaries, parents, affiliates, directors, officers, employees, and agents, from and against all third-party actions arising from: (a) the content you submit to or through the Services; and (b) allegations of actions or omissions by you that (regardless if proven) would constitute a breach of this Agreement.\nThis Agreement begins when you first use our Services and continues so long as you use our Service or have an account with us, whichever is longer. Paid accounts will continue for the subscription period and will renew in accordance with Section 4 above. With respect to Basic (free) memberships, Vimeo may terminate this Agreement at any time by providing thirty (30) days\u2019 written notice, and users may terminate at any time by deleting their accounts.\nIf you breach this Agreement, Vimeo may, at its option: (a) terminate this Agreement immediately, with or without advance written notice; (b) suspend, delete, or limit access to your account or any content within it; and (c) to the extent permitted by applicable law, retain any amounts payable to you (which you forfeit). If Vimeo deletes your account for breach, you may not re-register.\nIn the event of any termination or expiration, the following sections will survive: Section 7.2 (Indemnification), Section 9 (Disclaimers), Section 10 (Limitation of Liability), and Section 11 (General Provisions).\nVIMEO PROVIDES THE SERVICES ON AN \u201cAS IS\u201d AND \u201cAS AVAILABLE\u201d BASIS. YOU USE THE SERVICES AT YOUR OWN RISK. You must provide your own device and Internet access.\nEXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH HEREIN, AND TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, VIMEO DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT. Among other things, Vimeo makes no representations or warranties:\n---That our Services, or any part thereof, will be available or permitted in your jurisdiction, uninterrupted or error-free, or accessible from all devices or browsers;\n---Concerning any content submitted by our users;\n---That any geo-filtering or digital rights management solution that we might offer will be effective;\n---That our Services will meet your business or professional needs;\n---That we will continue to support any particular feature or maintain backwards compatibility with any third-party software or device; or\n---Concerning any third-party websites and resources.\nTO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW: (A) VIMEO SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES, INCLUDING DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF BUSINESS, PROFITS, GOODWILL, DATA, OR OTHER INTANGIBLE LOSSES; AND (B) VIMEO'S TOTAL LIABILITY TO YOU, EXCEPT FOR VIMEO\u2019S CONTRACTUAL PAYMENT OBLIGATIONS HEREUNDER (IF ANY), SHALL NOT EXCEED THE AMOUNTS PAID BY YOU TO VIMEO OVER THE TWELVE (12) MONTHS PRECEDING YOUR CLAIM(S) OR ONE HUNDRED DOLLARS (USD $100), WHICHEVER IS GREATER.\nChoice of Law: This Agreement will be governed by the laws of New York State and the United States of America (with respect to matters subject to federal jurisdiction such as copyright), without regard to principles of conflicts of law.\nChoice of Venue; Jury Trial Waiver: Any action relating to this Agreement or your use of our Services must be commenced in the state or federal courts located in New York County, New York State, United States of America; you consent to the exclusive jurisdiction of those courts. IN ANY SUCH ACTION, VIMEO AND YOU IRREVOCABLY WAIVE ANY RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY.\nReservation of Rights, Severability, Force Majeure: Vimeo reserves all rights not expressly granted herein. Vimeo\u2019s rights and remedies are cumulative. No failure or delay by Vimeo in exercising any right will waive any further exercise of that right. If any term of this Agreement is found invalid or unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction, that term will be limited or severed.

Except as expressly stated herein, nothing in this Agreement confers any right on any third party.\nEntire Agreement: This Agreement constitutes the entire understanding of the parties and supersedes all prior understandings regarding the subject matter hereof and may not be modified except in accordance with Section 1 or in a document executed by authorized representatives of Vimeo. If you have a signed agreement with Vimeo, any conflicting term of that agreement will prevail over the terms hereof, but only as to the subject matter of that agreement.\nAddenda: This Agreement incorporates the following documents (and no others) by reference:\n---Privacy Policy\n---Cookie Policy\n---Copyright Policy\n---Government Entity Addendum\n---App Addendum\n---Vimeo On Demand Viewer Agreement\n---Stock Footage License Agreement\n---Seller Addendum\n---API License Addendum\n---Enterprise Terms\nNotices: You must send any notices of a legal nature to us by email or at:\nVimeo, Inc.\nAttention: Legal Department\n555 West 18th Street\nNew York, New York 10011\n"

We hope you love our products and services \u2014 from website publishing tools to ecommerce solutions to security backup systems to management tools for global companies to the next great idea that we haven\u2019t even thought of yet \u2014 as much as we love creating them.\nThese Terms of Service (\u201cTerms\u201d) describe our commitments to you, and your rights and responsibilities when using our services. Please read them carefully and reach out to us if you have any questions.\nWe\u2019ve decided to make these Terms available under a Creative Commons Sharealike license. You can grab a copy of these Terms and other legal documents on Github. You\u2019re more than welcome to copy them, adapt them, and repurpose them for your own use. Just make sure to revise the language so that your Terms reflect your actual practices. Also, if you do use these Terms, we\u2019d appreciate a credit and link to Automattic somewhere on your website.\nThese Terms govern your access to and use of WordPress.com, Jetpack.com, VaultPress.com, and Happy.Tools, as well as all content and Automattic products and services (for example, ecommerce services as outlined below in Section 7e) available at or though these websites (collectively, \u201cServices\u201d).\nThese Terms also govern visitors\u2019 access to and use of any websites that use our Services, such as websites hosted on WordPress.com that are operated by our users.\nFor some of Automattic\u2019s other products and services, such as WooCommerce, Akismet, CrowdSignal, and WordPress.com VIP, additional Terms of Service may apply and will be posted on the websites for those products and services.\nOur Services are offered subject to your acceptance, without modification, of all of the terms and conditions contained herein and all other operating rules, policies (including, without limitation, Automattic\u2019s Privacy Policy), and procedures that may be published from time to time by Automattic (collectively, the \u201cAgreement\u201d). You agree that we may automatically upgrade our Services, and the Agreement will apply to any upgrades.\nPlease read the Agreement carefully before accessing or using our Services. By accessing or using any part of our Services, you agree to become bound by the Agreement. If you do not agree to all the terms of the Agreement, then you may not access or use our Services.\nThroughout these Terms, \u201cyou\u201d applies to both individuals and entities that access or use our Services. If you are an individual using our Services on behalf of an entity, you represent and warrant that you have the authority to bind that entity to the Agreement and that by using our Service(s), you are accepting the Agreement on behalf of that entity.\nWe use the term \u201cDesignated Countries\u201d to refer to Australia, Canada, Japan, Mexico, New Zealand, and all countries located in the European continent. If you reside in the \u201cDesignated Countries,\u201d your Agreement is with Aut O\u2019Mattic A8C Ireland Ltd. If you reside outside of the \u201cDesignated Countries,\u201d your Agreement is with Automattic Inc.\nWe refer to Aut O\u2019Mattic A8C Ireland Ltd. and Automattic Inc. collectively as \u201cAutomattic\u201d or \u201cwe\u201d throughout these Terms.\nWhere use of our Services requires an account, you agree to provide us with complete and accurate information when you register for an account. You will be solely responsible and liable for any activity that occurs under your username. You are responsible for keeping your account information up-to-date and for keeping your password secure.\nYou are responsible for maintaining the security of your account and any Service-related website, store, or other content, and you are fully responsible for all activities that occur under your account and any other actions taken in connection with our Services. You shall not share or misuse your access credentials. You must immediately notify us of any unauthorized uses of your account, store, or website, or of any other breach of security. We will not be liable for any acts or omissions by you, including any damages of any kind incurred as a result of such acts or omissions.\nOur Services are not directed to children. Access to and use of our Services is only for those over the age of 13 (or 16 in the European Union). If you are younger than this, you may not register for or use our Services. Any person who registers as a user or provides their personal information to our Services represents that they are 13 years of age or older (or 16 years or older in the European Union).\nWe have not reviewed, and cannot review, all of the content (such as, but not limited to, text, photo, video, audio, code, computer software, items for sale, or other materials) posted to our Services by users or anyone else (\u201cContent\u201d) and are not responsible for any use or effects of such Content. So, for example:\n---We do not endorse any Content or represent that Content is accurate, useful, or non-harmful. Content could be offensive, indecent, or objectionable; include technical inaccuracies, typographical mistakes, or other errors; or violate or infringe the privacy, publicity rights, intellectual property rights (see our Copyright Infringement and DMCA Policy section to submit copyright complaints), or other proprietary rights of third parties.\n---If you post Content, comment on a website, or otherwise make (or allow any third party to make) Content available on our Services, you are entirely responsible for the Content, and any harm resulting from, that Content or your conduct.\n---We disclaim any responsibility for any harm resulting from anyone\u2019s use, purchase, or downloading of Content. If you access or use any Content, you are responsible for taking precautions as necessary to protect yourself and your computer systems from viruses, worms, Trojan horses, and other harmful or destructive content.\n---Any Content offered for sale through any of our Services are the seller\u2019s sole responsibility, and you agree that you will look solely to the seller for any damages that result from your purchase or use of Content.\n---We are not a party to, and will have no responsibility or liability for, any communications, transactions, interactions, or disputes between you and the provider of any Content.\n---Please note that additional third party terms and conditions may apply to the downloading, copying, purchase, or use of Content.\nWe also have not reviewed, and cannot review, all of the material, including computer software, made available through the websites and web pages that link to, or are linked from, WordPress.com or our other Services. For example:\n---We do not have any control over those websites and are not responsible for their contents or their use.\n---The existence of a link to or from one of our Services does not represent or imply that we endorse such website.\n---You are responsible for taking precautions as necessary to protect yourself and your computer systems from viruses, worms, Trojan horses, and other harmful or destructive content.\n---We disclaim any responsibility for any harm resulting from non-Automattic websites.\nFees. Some of our Services are offered for a fee \u2014 such as Jetpack, and VaultPress, and Happy Tools \u2013 while other Services may be free with optional paid upgrades, such as a WordPress.com plan (collectively, \u201cPaid Services\u201d). By using a Paid Service, you agree to pay the specified fees. Depending on the Paid Service, there may be a one-time fee or recurring fees. For recurring fees, we\u2019ll bill or charge you for in regular intervals (such as monthly, annually, or biennially), on a pre-pay basis until you cancel, which you can do at any time by contacting the relevant support team.\nTaxes. To the extent permitted by law, or unless explicitly stated otherwise, all fees are exclusive of applicable federal, provincial, state, local or other governmental sales, goods and services, harmonized or other taxes, fees, or charges now in force or enacted in the future (\u201cTaxes\u201d). You are responsible for payment of all applicable Taxes relating to your use of our Services, your payments, or your purchases. If we are obligated to pay or collect Taxes on the Fees you\u2019ve paid or will pay, you are responsible for such Taxes, and we may collect payment for such Taxes.\nPayment. If your payment fails or Paid Services are otherwise not paid for on time, we may immediately cancel or revoke your access to the Paid Services. If you contact your bank or credit card company to decline or reverse the charge of fees for Paid Services, we may revoke your access to our Services in general.\nAutomatic Renewal. To ensure uninterrupted service, recurring Paid Services are automatically renewed. This means that unless you cancel a Paid Service before the end of the applicable subscription period, it will automatically renew, and you authorize us to invoice you or use any payment mechanism we have on record for you to collect the then-applicable subscription fee (as well as any Taxes). Your Paid Services are renewed for the same interval of time. For example, if you purchase a WordPress.com annual plan, you will be charged each year.\nRefunds. While you may cancel a Paid Service at any time, refunds are issued in our sole discretion, unless otherwise required by applicable law.\nFee Changes. We may change our fees at any time. When applicable, we may give you advance notice of the fee changes. If you don\u2019t agree with the fee changes, you can cancel your Paid Service.\nYou represent and warrant that your use of our Services:\n---Will be in strict accordance with these Terms;\n---Will comply with all applicable laws and regulations (including, without limitation, all applicable laws regarding online conduct and acceptable content, privacy, data protection, and the transmission of technical data exported from the United States or the country in which you reside);\n---Will not use the Services for any unlawful purposes, to publish illegal content, or in furtherance of illegal activities;\n---Will not infringe or misappropriate the intellectual property rights of any third party;\n---Will not overburden Automattic\u2019s systems, as determined by us in our sole discretion;\n---Will not disclose sensitive personal information of others;\n---Will not be used to send spam or bulk unsolicited messages;\n---Will not interfere with, disrupt, or attack any service or network; and\n---Will not be used to create, distribute, or enable material that is \u2013 or that facilitates or operates in conjunction with \u2013 malware, spyware, adware, or other malicious programs or code.\nWordPress.com enables you to create beautiful websites and blogs, and we would love for you to use it. A WordPress.com account also allows you to sign into some of our Services.\nWordPress.com\u2019s basic service is free, and we offer paid plans for advanced features such as a custom domain name, extra storage, and access to premium themes. Our service is designed to give you as much control and ownership over what goes on your website as possible and encourage you to express yourself freely. However, be responsible in what you publish. In particular, make sure that none of the prohibited items (like spam, viruses, or serious threats of violence) appear on your website.\nIf you find a WordPress.com website that you believe violates these Terms, please visit our dispute resolution and reporting page.\nYour WordPress.com Website. If you create a website on WordPress.com, you get to use an Automattic-owned subdomain, such as example.wordpress.com or mollys.food.blog. You must not engage in \u201cdomain squatting,\u201d claim an unreasonable number of subdomains (as determined by us), or sell access to any subdomains.\nLicense. By submitting Content to Automattic for inclusion on your website, you grant Automattic a world-wide, royalty-free, and non-exclusive license to reproduce, modify, adapt, and publish the Content solely for the purpose of displaying, distributing, and promoting your website. This license also allows Automattic to make any publicly-posted Content available to third parties selected by Automattic (through Firehose, for example) so that these third parties can analyze and distribute (but not publicly display) the Content through their services. You also give other WordPress.com users permission to share your Content on other WordPress.com websites and add their own Content to it (aka to \u201creblog\u201d your Content), so long as they use only a portion of your post and they give you credit as the original author by linking back to your website (the reblogging function on WordPress.com does this automatically!).\nRemoving Content. If you delete Content, we will use reasonable efforts to remove it from public view (or in the case of a private website, from view by the authorized visitors) on WordPress.com, but you acknowledge that caching or references to the Content may not be made immediately unavailable.\nWeb Traffic. We use a third party, comScore, Inc. (\u201ccomScore\u201d), to measure WordPress.com\u2019s audience and usage. By hosting your website on WordPress.com, you agree to assign the traffic relating to your website to Automattic and authorize us to sign a Traffic Assignment Letter on your behalf for comScore audience measurement reports. Your website\u2019s traffic will be included under Automattic. You understand that your website will not receive credit for traffic in these reports, and you must not assign your website\u2019s traffic to any other party. If we or comScore require additional documentation to verify ownership of your website or domain name, you agree to make reasonable efforts to accommodate such requests.\nProhibited Uses. By using WordPress.com, you represent and warrant that your Content and conduct do not violate the User Guidelines.\nHTTPS. We offer free HTTPS on all WordPress.com websites by default, including those using custom domains, via Let\u2019s Encrypt. By signing up and using a custom domain on WordPress.com, you authorize us to act on the domain name registrant\u2019s behalf (by requesting the necessary certificates, for example) for the sole purpose of providing HTTPS on your website.\nAdvertisements. We reserve the right to display advertisements on your website unless you have purchased a plan that includes the removal of ads.\nAttribution. We reserve the right to display attribution text or links in your website footer or toolbar, attributing WordPress.com or the theme author, for example. Some of these attributions may not be altered or removed. For more details about what these attributions might look like, and under which circumstances (if any) they may be altered or removed, please see our Admin and Action Bars support page.\nFriends of WP.com Themes. By activating a partner theme from the Friends of WP.com section of our themes directory, you agree to that partner\u2019s terms of service. You can decline the terms of service at any time by deactivating the partner theme.\nDomain Names. We act as a registrar and also work with third party registrars in order to provide our users with domain name services. When you register a domain name on WordPress.com, or when you transfer an existing domain name to WordPress.com, you become bound by the relevant registrar\u2019s terms and conditions, either the Automattic Domain Name Registration Agreement, Tucows Domain Inc. Registration Agreement, or this Domain Name Registration Agreement, in addition to these Terms. When you register a domain, you are presented with and agree to the relevant domain registration agreement. If you didn\u2019t make a note of it, you can look it up at any time at WordPress.com. Please see this support page for instructions on how to determine which domain registration agreement(s) apply to you and your domains. These registrar terms are incorporated by reference into these Terms.\nFurther, your use of the domain name is also subject to the policies of the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (\u201cICANN\u201d). You can read about your rights and responsibilities as a domain name registrant under ICANN\u2019s Registrar Accreditation Agreement and about domain name registration generally.\nFor details about what happens during the domain expiration process, and how we may notify you of domain expiration, please see the Domain Expiration support page.\nPlease refer to the domain pricing and available TLDs page for details about fees associated with domain registrations, renewals, and redemptions.\nJetpack is a plugin that connects your self-hosted WordPress website to WordPress.com\u2019s infrastructure to give you powerful WordPress.com features.\nJetpack Content. You\u2019re fully responsible for the content of any website you own that runs Jetpack (\u201cJetpack Content\u201d).\nFeatures. Jetpack includes various features, and you can visit Jetpack.com to learn more about them. Some features, like Enhanced Distribution, when activated, will include your Jetpack Content in Firehose. By activating these features, you grant us permission to display your Jetpack Content on WordPress.com for the purpose of distributing and promoting your website. Some features are on by default and others you need to enable manually. You can see which features are active, and activate and deactivate features, on your dashboard.\nLicense. You agree that we may scan your website, and compile aggregated/anonymized statistics for our internal use to optimize Jetpack\u2019s performance. By submitting Content to Automattic for inclusion on your website, you grant Automattic a world-wide, royalty-free, and non-exclusive license to reproduce, modify, adapt, and publish the Content solely for the purpose of displaying, distributing, and promoting your website. This license also allows Automattic to make any publicly-posted Content available to third parties selected by Automattic (through Firehose, for example) so that these third parties can analyze and distribute (but not publicly display) the Content through their services.\nStorage of Information. Certain Jetpack features rely on WordPress.com servers to function, such as those that allow you to send email, publish links, relate posts to each other, or resize images. To take advantage of the performance boosting features of Jetpack, certain information about the Content, settings, and setup of your website are synced with our servers, as described on our What Data Does Jetpack Sync? support page.\nProhibited Uses. Your website and Jetpack Content must comply with Jetpack\u2019s Service Guidelines.\nVaultPress is a subscription-based security and backup service for self-hosted WordPress websites.\nVaultPress Content. VaultPress will backup your WordPress content (e.g., your WordPress database, plugins, themes, and uploads, as well as some additional files, as described in this introduction to VaultPress) (\u201cVaultPress Content\u201d). You can view the Content that VaultPress backs up via your VaultPress dashboard. You\u2019re fully responsible for your VaultPress Content. It\u2019s your responsibility to ensure that your website\u2019s Content abides by applicable laws and by these Terms. We don\u2019t actively review the VaultPress Content.\nAccess. If you lose access to your WordPress.com account, you may not be able to access your backed up VaultPress Content.\nLicense. By using VaultPress, you grant us access to your website\u2019s servers for the purpose of backing up and securing your VaultPress Content, and restoring files and database information (which may include access details for multiple servers or accounts for each website that we backup). In order to address security vulnerabilities, we may push an upgrade to your website, or we may access your website to remove malicious code. We may also scan VaultPress Content and compile aggregated/anonymized statistics for our internal use to optimize the performance of the VaultPress service. You also grant us a worldwide, royalty-free, and non-exclusive license to copy and store your VaultPress Content, to the extent necessary to operate the VaultPress service. These Terms don\u2019t give us any rights in your VaultPress Content, beyond those we need to operate VaultPress. You own your VaultPress Content.\nCancellation. If you cancel your subscription to VaultPress, we will queue your backed-up VaultPress Content for deletion.\nHappy Tools is a suite of software and consulting services to help modern and distributed companies manage, grow, and support their business.\nProhibited Uses. You agree not to:\n---Modify, decompile, reverse engineer or otherwise alter or seek to derive the trade secrets and other inherent intellectual property of Happy Tools; or\n---License, sublicense, sell, resell, rent, lease, transfer, assign, distribute, or otherwise commercially exploit or make Happy Tools available to any third party, other than your authorized users.\nThere are certain features offered via WooCommerce, WooCommerce Services, or WordPress.com that enable you to sell items (goods, content, services, etc.) on your website (\u201cEcommerce Services\u201d). If you use WooCommerce, the WooCommerce Use Terms also apply.\nUsage of Information. WooCommerce Services may require Automattic\u2019s servers, a connection to our partners, and/or data from your website, to work, as described on our What Data Does Jetpack Sync? support page.\nProhibited Uses. If your store is on WordPress.com, you must not violate our User Guidelines or Store Guidelines.\nThird Party Services. You may choose to set up and/or use third party services, such Stripe or PayPal to collect payment, TaxJar to calculate taxes, or EasyPost to manage shipping. If you do so, be aware that some of your \u2014 and your customers\u2019 \u2014 data may be passed to the respective third party, and the respective third party\u2019s terms of service, privacy policy, and other policies may apply. We are not involved in these relationships. Please note that some of these third party services (like TaxJar) may be enabled by default, but you may disable them before your store is set up. If you do not want to use these third party services, please disable them.\nTax Calculations. Tax calculations are provided by TaxJar. You are responsible for all taxes and fees associated with your ecommerce activities. You must collect, report, and/or pay the correct amounts to the appropriate authorities, if applicable and, if needed, inform your customers about any taxes they may be required to pay and issue appropriate invoices. While some Ecommerce Services allow you to include sales taxes or Value Added Taxes in transactions, you should not rely solely on these features. While our goal is to keep our documents and tools up-to-date, tax laws change rapidly, and we do not guarantee that tax calculations you receive through or in connection with our Services are complete and accurate. Tax laws also differ from jurisdiction to jurisdiction and may be subject to different interpretations by different authorities. We recommend that you consult with a tax professional for your specific tax situation when assessing the correct tax rates you should charge.\nShipping Services. Shipping labels are provided by EasyPost and allow you to take advantage of real-time shipping rates to purchase postage and print shipping labels from certain mailing services, such as USPS and Canada Post. We act only as an intermediary between you and these third parties; we are not involved in any way with your product or its shipment. We also do not warrant that the results you obtain from the use of these services (rates and labels, for example) will be accurate or reliable.\nYou are solely responsible for compliance with all applicable rules and regulations, including domestic and international shipping and customs regulations and those of the relevant mailing service. For example, if you use USPS postage, you will need to comply with their shipping restrictions and mailing standards, among others.\nIn addition, you are solely responsible for customs charges, import taxes or duties, or any other charges related to your shipments. If any charges are assessed against us as a result of your use of the shipping services, you will reimburse us for the full amount within 7 days.\nYou authorize us to charge you for the fees associated with each shipping label you create. Each fee will be charged separately to the payment methods you have provided in your WordPress.com account, which you can view and manage as described the Payment Methods support page. If you have multiple payment methods, you can select which should be used for the shipping label service. If we are unable to collect payment from you for these fees, you will be responsible for payment within 7 days; please contact us to remit payment.\nRefunds for unused shipping labels must be requested in your store\u2019s wp-admin within 30 days of creating the label. Please note that depending on your bank and the third party involved, it may take up to 45 days for your refund to issue. If you haven\u2019t received your refund within this time frame, please contact us.\nYou may not transfer or sell postage and/or shipping labels to a third party.\nYour Responsibilities. You are solely responsible for all of your ecommerce activities, including your store, your items, its operation, all applicable taxes and fees, compliance with the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS), and compliance with any applicable laws. Among other things, this means that:\n---You should use your best judgment when setting up your store, operating your store, processing payments, and selling items. For example, you may not want to accept check payments if you are not comfortable sharing your mailing address with a customer, or you may want to publish payment and return policies.\n---We are not involved in your relationships or transactions with any customer or potential customer.\n---You are responsible for resolving all support questions, comments, and complaints, including refunds, chargebacks, or pricing questions. You should provide contact information so that customers may contact you with questions or complaints.\n---You are responsible for delivering items sold to your customers, and for fulfilling all promises, representations, or warranties you make to them in connection with a sale.\nAs we ask others to respect our intellectual property rights, we respect the intellectual property rights of others. If you believe that material located on or associated with an Automattic product or service violates your copyright, please notify us in accordance with Automattic\u2019s Digital Millennium Copyright Act (\u201cDMCA\u201d) Policy. We will respond to all such notices, including as required or appropriate by removing the infringing material or disabling all links to the infringing material. We will terminate a visitor\u2019s access to and use of the website if, under appropriate circumstances, the visitor is determined to be a repeat infringer of the copyrights or other intellectual property rights of Automattic or others. In the case of such termination, we will have no obligation to provide a refund of any amounts previously paid to us.\nThe Agreement does not transfer from Automattic to you any Automattic or third party intellectual property, and all right, title, and interest in and to such property will remain (as between the parties) solely with Automattic.

We use auto-renewal for many of our fee-based Services. At the expiration of each subscription term for such fee-based Services, we will automatically renew your subscription and charge the credit card or other payment method you have provided to us, unless you cancel your subscription at least 48 hours before the end of the current period.

YOU AND OATH BOTH AGREE TO RESOLVE ANY AND ALL DISPUTES, CONTROVERSIES OR CLAIMS THAT IN ANY WAY ARISE OUT OF OR RELATE TO THESE TERMS OR FROM ANY SERVICES YOU RECEIVE FROM US (OR FROM ANY ADVERTISING FOR ANY SUCH SERVICES), INCLUDING ANY DISPUTES BETWEEN YOU AND OUR EMPLOYEES OR AGENTS (\u201cDISPUTE(S)\u201d), ONLY BY ARBITRATION ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS OR IN SMALL CLAIMS COURT. YOU UNDERSTAND THAT BY AGREEING TO THESE TERMS, ARBITRATION OR A SMALL CLAIMS ACTION WILL BE THE SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE MEANS OF RESOLVING ANY DISPUTE BETWEEN US. YOU ALSO UNDERSTAND THAT BY AGREEING TO THESE TERMS, YOU AND OATH ARE GIVING UP THE RIGHT TO BRING A CLAIM IN COURT OR IN FRONT OF A JURY (EXCEPT FOR MATTERS THAT MAY BE BROUGHT IN SMALL CLAIMS COURT), AND THAT YOU AND OATH ARE GIVING UP THE RIGHT TO PROCEED WITH ANY CLASS ACTION OR OTHER REPRESENTATIVE ACTION. WHILE ARBITRATION PROCEDURES MAY BE DIFFERENT THAN COURT PROCEDURES, AN ARBITRATOR CAN AWARD YOU INDIVIDUALLY THE SAME DAMAGES AND RELIEF AS A COURT, AND JUDGMENT ON THE AWARD RENDERED BY THE ARBITRATOR MAY BE ENTERED AND ENFORCED IN ANY COURT HAVING JURISDICTION THEREOF. THE PARTIES UNDERSTAND THAT ABSENT THIS MANDATORY PROVISION, THEY WOULD HAVE THE RIGHT TO SUE IN COURT AND HAVE A JURY TRIAL. THEY FURTHER UNDERSTAND THAT, IN SOME INSTANCES, THE COSTS OF ARBITRATION COULD EXCEED THE COSTS OF LITIGATION AND THE RIGHT TO DISCOVERY MAY BE MORE LIMITED IN ARBITRATION THAN IN COURT. We also both agree that:\nNotice of Dispute. If either you or Oath intends to arbitrate under these Terms, the party seeking arbitration must first notify the other party of the Dispute in writing at least 30 days in advance of initiating the arbitration. Notice to Oath should be sent to Oath either by mail to Oath, Attn: Disputes, 701 First Avenue, Sunnyvale, CA 94089; or disputes@oath.com. Notice to you will be to your email address(es) and street address(es), if any, that Oath has in its records at the time the notice is sent. The notice must describe the nature of the claim and the relief being sought. If we are unable to resolve the Dispute within 30 days, either party may then proceed to file a claim for arbitration.\nArbitration Procedure. The Federal Arbitration Act applies to these Terms. Except for small claims court cases, any and all Disputes will be resolved by arbitration administered by the American Arbitration Association (\"AAA\"). The AAA will apply the Commercial Arbitration Rules to the arbitration of any Dispute pursuant to these Terms, unless you are an individual and use the Services for personal or household use, in which case the AAA's Consumer Arbitration Rules will apply (excluding any rules or procedures governing or permitting class actions). You can get procedures (including the process for beginning an arbitration), rules and fee information from the AAA (www.adr.org). These Terms govern to the extent they conflict with the AAA\u2019s Commercial Arbitration Rules or Consumer Arbitration Rules.\nSmall Claims Court Option. As an alternative to arbitration, you may bring an individual action in small claims court in your county of residence (or if a business, your principal place of business) or Santa Clara County, California provided that your Dispute meets the requirements of the small claims court.\nArbitration Location. Unless you and Oath agree otherwise, the arbitration must take place, or the small claims action must be filed, in the county of your primary residence or Santa Clara County, California.\nArbitration Fees and Expenses. We will reimburse any filing fee that the AAA charges you for arbitration of the Dispute. If you provide us with signed written notice that you cannot pay the filing fee, we will pay the fee directly to the AAA. If the arbitration proceeds, we will also pay any administrative and arbitrator fees charged later.\nSettlement Offers. We may, but are not obligated to, make a written settlement offer anytime before or during arbitration. The amount or terms of any settlement offer may not be disclosed to the arbitrator unless and until the arbitrator issues an award on the claim. If you do not accept the offer and the arbitrator awards you an amount of money that is more than our offer but less than $5,000, we agree to: (a) pay you $5,000 instead of the lower amount awarded, (b) pay your reasonable attorney\u2019s fees and costs, and (c) reimburse any arbitration filing fees and arbitrator fees and expenses incurred in connection with the arbitration of your Dispute. If the arbitrator awards you more than $5,000 and we are not challenging the award, then we will pay you the amount of the award.\nSeverability. If any part of this agreement to arbitrate is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be unenforceable, the court will reform the agreement to the extent necessary to cure the unenforceable part(s), and the parties will arbitrate their Dispute(s) without reference to or reliance upon the unenforceable part(s). However, if for any reason the Class Action Waiver set forth below in subsection 14.2.c cannot be enforced as to some or all of the Dispute, then the agreement to arbitrate will not apply to that Dispute or portion thereof. Any Disputes covered by any deemed unenforceable Class Action Waiver provision may only be litigated in a court of competent jurisdiction, but the remainder of the agreement to arbitrate will be binding and enforceable. To avoid any doubt or uncertainty, the parties do not agree to class arbitration or to the arbitration of any claims brought on behalf of others.\nCLASS ACTION WAIVER FOR U.S. USERS. THESE TERMS DO NOT ALLOW CLASS OR COLLECTIVE ARBITRATIONS, EVEN IF THE AAA PROCEDURES OR RULES WOULD. NOTWITHSTANDING ANY OTHER PROVISION OF THESE TERMS, THE ARBITRATOR MAY AWARD MONEY OR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF ONLY IN FAVOR OF THE INDIVIDUAL PARTY SEEKING RELIEF AND ONLY TO THE EXTENT NECESSARY TO PROVIDE THE RELIEF WARRANTED BY THAT PARTY'S INDIVIDUAL CLAIM. ARBITRATION OR COURT PROCEEDINGS HELD UNDER THESE TERMS CANNOT BE BROUGHT, MAINTAINED OR RESOLVED ON BEHALF OF OR BY A CLASS, AS A PRIVATE ATTORNEY-GENERAL, OR IN ANY OTHER REPRESENTATIVE CAPACITY. IN ADDITION, INDIVIDUAL PROCEEDINGS CANNOT BE COMBINED WITHOUT THE CONSENT OF ALL OF THE PARTIES. ANY QUESTION REGARDING THE ENFORCEABILITY OR INTERPRETATION OF THIS PARAGRAPH WILL BE DECIDED BY A COURT AND NOT THE ARBITRATOR.\nJURY TRIAL WAIVER FOR U.S. USERS. IF FOR ANY REASON A DISPUTE PROCEEDS IN COURT RATHER THAN THROUGH ARBITRATION, YOU AND OATH AGREE THAT THERE WILL NOT BE A JURY TRIAL. YOU AND OATH UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVE ANY RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION, PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM IN ANY WAY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THESE TERMS. IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, THIS PARAGRAPH MAY BE FILED TO SHOW A WRITTEN CONSENT TO A TRIAL BY THE COURT.\nChoice of Law. These Terms and the relationship between the parties, including any claim or dispute that might arise between the parties, whether sounding in contract, tort, or otherwise, will be governed by the laws of the State of New York without regard to its conflict of law provisions. In no event will the parties bring claims against one another under the laws of another jurisdiction.\nForum. If for any reason a Dispute proceeds in court rather than through arbitration, all such Disputes (regardless of theory) arising out of or relating to these Terms, or the relationship between you and Oath, will be brought exclusively in the courts located in the county of New York, New York or the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York. In such cases, you and Oath agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of the courts located within the county of New York, New York or the Southern District of New York, and agree to waive any and all objections to the exercise of jurisdiction over the parties by such courts and to venue in such courts.\nCustomer Support.
