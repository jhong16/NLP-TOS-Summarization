When you use YouTube, you join a community of people from all over the world.
Every cool, new community feature on YouTube involves a certain level of trust.
Millions of users respect that trust and we trust you to be responsible too.
Following the guidelines below helps to keep YouTube fun and enjoyable for everyone.
          
            
You might not like everything you see on YouTube.
If you think content is inappropriate, use the flagging feature to submit it for review by our YouTube staff.
Our staff carefully reviews flagged content 24 hours a day, 7 days a week to determine whether there’s a violation of our Community Guidelines.
          
                
Here are some common-sense rules that'll help you steer clear of trouble.
Please take these rules seriously and take them to heart.
Don't try to look for loopholes or try to lawyer your way around the guidelines
—just understand them and try to respect the spirit in which they were created.
              
                      
YouTube is not for pornography or sexually explicit content.
If this describes your video, even if it's a video of yourself, don't post it on YouTube.
Also, be advised that we work closely with law enforcement and we report child exploitation.

                      Don't post videos that encourage others to do things that might cause them to get badly hurt, especially kids.
Videos showing such harmful or dangerous acts may get age-restricted or removed depending on their severity.

Our products are platforms for free expression.
But we don't support content that promotes or condones violence against individuals or groups based on race or ethnic origin, religion, disability, gender, age, nationality, veteran status, or sexual orientation/gender identity, or whose primary purpose is inciting hatred on the basis of these core characteristics.
This can be a delicate balancing act, but if the primary purpose is to attack a protected group, the content crosses the line.

It's not okay to post violent or gory content that's primarily intended to be shocking, sensational, or gratuitous.
If posting graphic content in a news or documentary context, please be mindful to provide enough information to help people understand what's going on in the video.
Don't encourage others to commit specific acts of violence.

It’s not ok to post abusive videos and comments on YouTube.
If harassment crosses the line into a malicious attack it can be reported and may be removed.
In other cases, users may be mildly annoying or petty and should be ignored.

Everyone hates spam.
Don't create misleading descriptions, tags, titles, or thumbnails in order to increase views.
It's not okay to post large amounts of untargeted, unwanted or repetitive content, including comments and private messages.

                      Things like predatory behavior, stalking, threats, harassment, intimidation, invading privacy, revealing other people's personal information, and inciting others to commit violent acts or to violate the Terms of Use are taken very seriously.
Anyone caught doing these things may be permanently banned from YouTube.

If a YouTube creator’s on-
and/or off-platform behavior harms our users, community, employees or ecosystem, we may respond based on a number of factors including, but not limited to, the egregiousness of their actions and whether a pattern of harmful behavior exists.
Our response will range from suspending a creator’s privileges to account termination.
