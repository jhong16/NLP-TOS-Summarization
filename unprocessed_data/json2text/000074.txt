The Mint Service may also include a service that provides your one-bureau credit summary, credit score and monitoring alerts (“Credit Score Service”).

4. Account Information from Third Party Sites
Users may direct Intuit to retrieve their own information maintained online by third-parties with which they have customer relationships, maintain accounts or engage in financial transactions (“Account Information”). Intuit works with one or more online service providers to access this Account Information. Intuit does not review the Account Information for accuracy, legality or non-infringement. Intuit is not responsible for the Account Information or products and services offered by or on third-party sites.
Intuit cannot always foresee or anticipate technical or other difficulties which may result in failure to obtain data or loss of data, personalization settings or other service interruptions. Intuit cannot assume responsibility for the timeliness, accuracy, deletion, non-delivery or failure to store any user data, communications or personalization settings. For example, when displayed through the Services, Account Information is only as fresh as the time shown, which reflects when the information is obtained from such sites. Such information may be more up-to-date when obtained directly from the relevant sites. You can refresh your Account Information through the Services, in the manner prescribed in the associated instructions.

Intuit may from time to time provide automatic alerts and voluntary account-related alerts. Automatic alerts may be sent to you following certain changes to your account or information, such as a change in your Registration Information.
Voluntary account alerts may be turned on by default as part of the Services. They may then be customized, deactivated or reactivated by you. These alerts allow you to choose alert messages for your accounts. Intuit may add new alerts from time to time, or cease to provide certain alerts at any time upon its sole discretion. Each alert has different options available, and you may be asked to select from among these options upon activation of your alerts service.
You understand and agree that any alerts provided to you through the Services may be delayed or prevented by a variety of factors. Intuit may make commercially reasonable efforts to provide alerts in a timely manner with accurate information, but cannot guarantee the delivery, timeliness, or accuracy of the content of any alert. Intuit shall not be liable for any delays, failure to deliver, or misdirected delivery of any alert; for any errors in the content of an alert; or for any actions taken or not taken by you or any third party in reliance on an alert.
Electronic alerts will be sent to the email address you have provided as your primary email address for the Services. If your email address or your mobile device’s email address changes, you are responsible for informing us of that change. You can also choose to have alerts sent to a mobile device that accepts text messages. Changes to your email address or mobile number will apply to all of your alerts.
Because alerts are not encrypted, we will never include your passcode. However, alerts may include your Login ID and some information about your accounts. Depending upon which alerts you select, information such as an account balance or the due date for your credit card payment may be included. Anyone with access to your email will be able to view the content of these alerts. At any time you may disable future alerts.

21. Governing Law and Forum for Disputes
California state law governs this Agreement without regard to its conflicts of laws provisions.
ANY DISPUTE OR CLAIM RELATING IN ANY WAY TO THE SERVICES OR THESE TERMS OF USE WILL BE RESOLVED BY BINDING ARBITRATION, RATHER THAN IN COURT, except that you may assert claims in small claims court if your claims qualify. The Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this provision; the arbitrator shall apply California law to all other matters. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, any party to the arbitration may at any time seek injunctions or other forms of equitable relief from any court of competent jurisdiction. WE EACH AGREE THAT ANY AND ALL DISPUTES MUST BE BROUGHT IN THE PARTIES' INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. BY ENTERING INTO THIS AGREEMENT AND AGREEING TO ARBITRATION, YOU AGREE THAT YOU AND INTUIT ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO FILE A LAWSUIT AND THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY. IN ADDITION, YOU AGREE TO WAIVE THE RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION OR LITIGATE ON A CLASS-WIDE BASIS. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE EXPRESSLY AND KNOWINGLY WAIVED THESE RIGHTS.
To begin an arbitration proceeding, send a letter requesting arbitration and describing your claim to Intuit Inc., in care of our registered agent Corporation Service Company, 2711 Centerville Road, Wilmington, DE 19808. Arbitration will be conducted by the American Arbitration Association (AAA) before a single AAA arbitrator under the AAA’s rules, which are available at www.adr.org or by calling 1-800-778-7879. Payment of all filing, administration and arbitrator fees and costs will be governed by the AAA's rules, but if you are unable to pay any of them, we will pay them for you. In addition, we will reimburse all such fees and costs for claims totaling less than $75,000 unless the arbitrator determines the claims are frivolous. Likewise, we will not seek its attorneys’ fees or costs in arbitration unless the arbitrator determines your claims or defenses are frivolous. You may choose to have the arbitration conducted by telephone, based on written submissions, or in person in the county where you live or at another mutually agreed location. The decision of the arbitrator shall be final and not appealable, and judgment on the arbitration award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof. This Section 21 shall survive expiration, termination or rescission of this Agreement.

25. Bill Payment Service.
---Description of Bill Payment Service Mint Bills provides a bill payment service that allows you to make payments to certain third parties. Such bill payment service is provided by Intuit Payments Inc., a licensed money transmitter in required states. To be eligible to use the Bill Payment Services, you must be a resident of the United States or one of the countries specified by us. In order to use the Bill Payment Services, you may need to provide us with your account information with service providers you choose (such as account passwords and usernames) and any information necessary for us to access your accounts with such service providers ("Bill Payment Account Information"). By using the Bill Payment Services, you expressly authorize Intuit to access the Bill Payment Account Information, on your behalf and as your agent, solely for the purpose of providing the Services to you. Each time you add an account through your use of the Bill Payment Services, you will directly be connected to the website for the third party you have identified. Once you have added an account, we will submit information, including usernames and passwords that you provide, to log you into the third party site (each, a "Third Party Site"). You hereby authorize and permit us to use and store your Bill Payment Account Information to accomplish the foregoing and to configure the Bill Payment Services so that they are compatible with the Third Party Sites for which you submit your Bill Payment Account Information. In some cases, we may display bills to you from your service providers who are also customers of Intuit’s other products or services. You may decline use of Bill Payment Services for all billers at any time. You must adhere to our Acceptable Use Policy when using the Bill Payment Services. Such policy is provided on the Sites. We reserve the right not process transactions that violate our Acceptable Use Policy.
---Description of Fees There may be charges for certain transactions and services when you elect to use the Bill Payment Services. You agree to pay any fees for the Bill Payment Services you use or subscribe to as described on the Sites.
---Payee Information; Authority By initiating a payment through the Bill Payment Service, you authorize Mint Bills to charge the account that you designate as the account to which the bill payments should be charged or withdrawn from (the "Funding Account"). You agree to maintain a balance or available credit limit in the specified Funding Account that is sufficient to fund all payments you initiate. You represent and warrant that you have the right to authorize Mint Bills to charge the Funding Account for payments you initiate using the Bill Payment Services. You will indemnify and hold Intuit harmless from any claims by any third party, including any other owner of the account related to Intuit’s access to the Funding Account.
You are responsible for confirming the accuracy of the information you provide about each payment you send, including the email/physical address or telephone number of the recipient (the "Payee"), and the amount of the transaction.
You represent and warrant that Mint Bills may send communication to the Payee on your behalf in connection with the Bill Payment Services. By using the Bill Pay Services, you represent and warrant that you and each person you identify have consented to receive ongoing communication, including text messages from us. Such communication may include messages, including text messages, to the recipient of the Bill Payment Services to receive money you had paid them using the Bill Payment Services. You agree to inform Mint Bills if a person withdraws his consent to receiving text messages from you.
Mint Bills does not charge a fee to send a text message when using the Bill Pay Services. However, any text messages sent and/or received are subject to standard text message rates depending on the recipient’s carrier and terms and conditions with the carrier. To stop receiving messages, reply STOP to any text messages you receive from us.
---
Limits On Payees, Payment Amounts And Methods You acknowledge that certain Payees may not accept payment from all types of funding sources and that we may otherwise limit the payment methods available for a particular Payee. For example, you may not be permitted to use a credit card to make a mortgage payment. Additionally, Mint Bills may, at its discretion, impose limits on the number and amount of payments, in aggregate, that you can send using the Bill Payment Services.
Mint Bills may refuse to permit payment to any Payee if we reasonably believe such refusal is necessary or advisable for legal or security reasons. If you fail to maintain a balance in the applicable Funding Account that is insufficient to fund any payment that you initiate, Mint Bills may refuse to make any subsequent payment for as long as we determine to be necessary or appropriate. Mint Bills also reserves the right to refuse to make any other payment.
Mint Bills reserves the right to select the method in which to remit funds on your behalf, and the method to return funds to you in the event your Funding Account is closed or otherwise unavailable to us. The payment methods through the Bill Payment Services may include, but are not limited to, electronic or paper check payments, your designated credit card, or payment via other form of funds transfer that Mint Bills may choose to employ. Payments to Payees outside of the United States or its territories are prohibited through the Bill Payment Services. The Bill Payment Services does not support payment to all types of billers, including certain government agencies and bills such as tax payments and court-ordered payments.
---
Rejected or Returned Payments.
When you send a payment via the Bill Payment Services, the Payee is not required to accept it. You also understand that Payees, payment processors, or the mail/package delivery service providers may return payments to the Online Service for various reasons. These reasons can include, but are not limited to: the Payee’s forwarding address has expired; the Payee’s account number is not valid; the Payee is unable to locate the account; or your account with the Payee is paid in full. You agree that you will not hold Mint Bills liable for any damages resulting from a Payee not receiving payment made through the Bill Payment Services for any reason.
We use reasonable efforts to research and correct the returned payment and deliver it to your Payee. Payments outstanding after a reasonable time based on the method of payment may be automatically voided by Mint Bills and the payment amount credited to your Funding Account. You are responsible for reconciling your Account(s) and reviewing the status of the payments. If we are unable to complete a payment for any reason, we may, in a method of our choosing and at our sole discretion, provide you with notice. We will to the extent permitted by law, make reasonable attempts to return any unclaimed, refused, refunded, prohibited or denied payments to your Funding Account or use other reasonable efforts to return such payment to you as permitted by law.
---
Inability to Access Funds from Funding Account In using the Bill Payment Services, you are requesting Mint Bills to facilitate making payments from your Funding Account(s) to your Payee(s). If Bill Payment Service is unable to access funds from your specified Funding Account to complete a bill payment transaction you request for any reason (for example, non-sufficient funds, closed account, inability to locate account, or reversal by you and/or your bank), the transaction may not be completed. If Bill Payment Service is unable to access funds from your specified Funding Account for any reason, you agree that:
you will reimburse Mint Bills immediately, upon demand, the transaction amount to the extent that Mint Bills sent a payment to the Payee on your behalf;
you will reimburse Mint Bills for any fees imposed on us as a result of the transaction;
during the telephone call you make when you initiate payment for the Bill Payment Service you agree that Mint Bills can rely on your verbal authorization for the payment method you select;
you agree to give Mint Bills permission to record the call should any dispute arise regarding the Mint Bills Service; and
you will reimburse the Bill Payment Services for any fees, including reasonable attorney fees, we incur in attempting to collect the amount of the transaction from you.
Additionally, you agree that Mint Bills may: (a) reverse any corresponding credit or direct deposits issued to you; (b) reverse any payments Mint Bills made to your Payee; (c) apply any money currently held by Mint Bills to any amount owed to us; (d) initiate electronic fund transfer from your account to collect any unpaid amounts and our fees.
Mint Bills is not responsible for any overdraft fees, over-the-limit fees, or insufficient fund charges (including finance charges, late fees, or similar charges) that result from your failure to maintain a balance or available credit in the Funding Account that is sufficient to fund all payments you initiate.
If Mint Bills is not able to recover all amounts owed to us, we may report this information to third parties, including consumer reporting agencies, financial institutions. Mint Bills reserves all rights to pursue all available legal remedies to recover all owed amounts.
Any fees applicable to your use of the Bill Payment Services will be charged regardless of whether or not or how often you use the Bill Payment Services during each period for which you have subscribed to the applicable Service. There may be charges for additional transactions and other optional services that you elect to use. You agree to pay fees for the all Bill Payment Services you use or subscribe to as described on the Sites.

Your Liability You are solely liable for errors you make in using the Bill Payment Services, including the following:
you direct Mint Bills to submit a payment to a Payee from the wrong Funding Account;
you erroneously direct Mint Bills to submit a payment to a Payee multiple times;
you direct Mint Bills to submit the wrong amount to a Payee;
you direct Mint Bills to submit a payment to the wrong Payee; or
you change your mind about making a payment to a Payee after directing Mint Bills to submit the payment.
You are responsible for all fees, fines, penalties, and other liability incurred by Mint Bills, a Payee, you or a third party caused by or arising out of your breach of this Agreement and/or your use of the Bill Payment Services. You agree to reimburse Mint Bills, a Payee or the applicable third party for any and all such liability.
In the event that you are liable for any amounts owed to Mint Bills for a payment you authorized through the Bill Payment Services, Mint Bills may immediately remove such amounts from or charge such amounts to your applicable Funding Account. If the applicable Funding Account does not have funds or available credit sufficient to cover your liability, you will be required to immediately add funds to the Funding Account or otherwise provide payment to Mint Bills through other means. If you do not do so, Mint Bills may engage in collection efforts to recover such amounts from you.
Mint Bills does not have control of, or liability for, the products or services that are paid for via the Bill Payment Services.
---As permitted, you may cancel, edit, or stop a payment prior to the pay date by following the directions within the help section of the Bill Payment Service. Our ability to stop a payment request will depend on the manner in which the payment was initiated, the method of payment, and whether or not the Payee has begun processing payment. Although we will make a reasonable effort to accommodate a stop payment request, we will have no liability for failing to do so unless there is an exception provided elsewhere in this Agreement. We may also require you to present your stop payment request in writing after contacting customer care. The charge for each stop payment will be the current charge for such stop payment and fund recovery service as set out in any applicable fee schedule or as disclosed through the site.
---
Delays, Unauthorized Transactions, or Errors
Payment Processing Delays and Protection for Late Fees. You acknowledge that some transactions may take longer to be credited to your account with the applicable Payee due to circumstances beyond Mint Bills' control, such as delays in handling and posting payments by Payees or financial institutions or errors with account information or funding instructions.
When you send a payment to certain Payees, the payment may be treated as an authorization to the Payee to process your payment and complete the transaction. Some Payees may delay processing your payment, in which case the payment may be held as pending until the Payee processes your payment and your payment authorization will remain valid for up to 30 days.
To help ensure that there is enough time for the applicable Payee to receive any payments you submit through the Bill Payment Services, you should submit payment instructions at least 6 business days prior to the due date for the applicable bill for most electronic payments. Please add additional business days if we issue a paper check to the Payee on your behalf. If the due date falls on a weekend or holiday, you must submit the payment sufficiently in advance to include an additional day for processing. It is solely your responsibility to submit payments so they arrive by the Payee's due date.
Subject to the other provisions of this Agreement, Mint Bills will bear responsibility for any satisfactorily documented late payment related charges up to a reasonable amount, not to exceed $50.00 in the event a payment posts after its due date provided that the payment was submitted by you for payment in accordance with the guidelines specified in the beginning of this paragraph and the Bill Payment Services issued you a confirmation number for a payment, unless we are not responsible to you for one of the reasons listed in this section or below under "Protection for Mint Bills Errors." THIS IS MINT BILLS ONLY OBLIGATION TO YOU FOR ANY PAYMENT ERRORS, DELAYS, OR FAILURE. IF YOU DO NOT FOLLOW THESE RULES OR IF YOU DO NOT ALLOW ENOUGH TIME TO COMPLETE A PAYMENT, YOU ALONE ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY PENALTIES OR LATE CHARGES ON THAT PAYMENT.
Any fees applicable to your use of a Service will be charged regardless of whether or how often you use the Services during each period for which you have subscribed to the applicable Service. There may be charges for additional transactions and other optional services that you elect to use. You agree to pay fees for the all Services you use or subscribe to as described on the Sites.
Errors or other Issues Regarding Payments. It is your responsibility to review all payment transactions initiated in the Bill Payment Services against account statements you receive from your bank or other financial institution. Your payment transaction information is included in the receipts we provide you. ALL QUESTIONS ABOUT TRANSACTIONS MADE THROUGH THE BILL PAYMENT SERVICES MUST BE DIRECTED TO MINT BILLS, AND NOT TO THE BANK OR OTHER FINANCIAL INSTITUTION WHERE YOU HAVE YOUR ACCOUNT. We are responsible for our Bill Payment Services and for resolving any errors we caused.
We may not send you a periodic statement listing transactions that you make using the Bill Payment Service. The transactions will appear only on the statement issued by your bank or other financial institution. SAVE THE RECEIPTS FROM OUR BILL PAYMENT SERVICES, AND CHECK THEM AGAINST THE ACCOUNT STATEMENT YOU RECEIVE FROM YOUR BANK OR OTHER FINANCIAL INSTITUTION.
IF YOUR CREDENTIALS TO ACCESS THE BILL PAYMENT SERVICES OR YOUR MOBILE DEVICE ARE LOST OR STOLEN, NOTIFY US AT ONCE USING THE CONTACT METHODS SPECIFIED IN SECTION 6 OF ARTICLE I (GENERAL TERMS) ABOVE.
Protection for Mint Bills Errors. Mint Bills will use commercially reasonable efforts to facilitate the payment of your bills in accordance with this Agreement. However, Mint Bills will not be liable, for instance:
if, through no fault of ours, you do not have enough money in your account to make the transfer;
the payment is rejected, returned, mishandled, or delayed by the Payee for any reason;
you have provided Mint Bills with incorrect information about the Payee;
the Funding Account you specify as the payment source is closed or does not contain sufficient funds to complete the payment or the charge is rejected or returned by your bank or financial institution;
due to any pre-announced unavailability of the Bill Payment Services;
due to fraud or attacks on our systems, service or the Bill Payment Services;
due to third party service providers; or
due to circumstances beyond our control (for example, fire, flood, interference from an outside source, postal delays, or any failure by your computer, software, or Internet connection).
Unauthorized Transactions. You must notify Mint Bills immediately (no later than 90 days after the date of unauthorized transaction) if you suspect or believe that a transaction has occurred through the Bill Payment Services that you did not authorize or that you believe an incorrect amount was authorized. You may contact us using the contact methods specified in section 6 of Article I (General Terms) above. If you initially provide information to us via the telephone, we may require that you send your complaint or question in writing. You will be asked and are required to provide us with the following information: your name; the email address registered for the Bill Payment Services account; a description (including dollar amount) of the transaction that you believe is unauthorized or in error; and a Mint Bills reference/transaction ID; and explanation to why you believe there was unauthorized transaction or error. If we decide that there was no error, we will send you an explanation. You may ask for copies of the documents that we used in our investigation.
For unauthorized transfers and errors with respect to your credit card or debit card that are not related to the Bill Payment Services, please see your applicable card holder agreement.
---Risk Monitoring; Unusual or Suspicious Transactions In an effort to manage our risk, we may monitor your transactions and processing activity for high-risk practices or for fraudulent transactions. We may also engage third-party service providers to assist in these efforts and other elements of the Bill Payment Services. If Mint Bills believes there is suspicious or unusual activity, Mint Bills may temporarily suspend your access to Bill Payment Services. Suspicious or unusual activity includes, but is not limited to changes in your average transaction amount or processing pattern or use of different payment accounts. Mint Bills may require additional documentation to promptly reinstate your access to the Bill Payment Services.
---Termination Mint Bills may terminate or suspend your access to the Bill Payment Services at any time. Neither termination nor suspension shall affect your liability or obligations under this Agreement. In the event you or Mint Bills terminates your account, any payment(s) Mint Bills has already processed before the requested termination date may be completed. You should verify payment directly with your intended payee. Mint Bills is not responsible for any payments not completed by us as a result of termination.

26. Bill Processing Services
---Description of Service; Disclaimer . Mint Bills will provide a bill processing service for merchants and other billers (each a "Biller") that engage Mint Bills to process certain payments they receive from their payers ("Payers") who are also Mint Bills users. Mint Bills is not a party to these payments or to their underlying commercial transactions, and Mint Bills disclaims any and all responsibility for any payments or other disputes between Billers and Payers. Such disputes are entirely between the Billers and their Payers. Mint Bills is the payment processor for the Billers.
---Registration . Each Biller must register with Mint Bills and accept this Agreement. Mint Bills will collect information from Billers to enable us to verify your identities and satisfy ourselves that it is appropriate for Mint Bills to process your payment transactions in accordance with our legal obligations under such laws as "know your customer" and OFAC. Mint Bills reserves the right to decline to accept a Biller into our Biller Processing Service, or to suspend or terminate our processing for any Biller at any time, or to suspend or terminate our Biller Processing Service entirely at any time and at our sole discretion.
---Additional Agreements . If required by an automated clearing house association (ACH), another processor or one of our banks, a Biller may have to enter into additional agreements. If you are unwilling to do so if requested, we may suspend or terminate your access to our Biller Processing Service.
---Bill Processing Method . Mint Bills will process payments for Billers by (i) facilitating ACH debit entries or other methods to withdraw funds from our users' funding accounts, (ii) receiving these funds on your behalf, (iii) deducting our bill payment processing fee; and (iv) remitting the balance to you. You hereby authorize Mint Bills to process bill payments for you in accordance with our Terms of Use and to make payments to you by paper draft or electronic funds transfer as long as you are a participant in our Biller Processing Service.
---Termination by You . You may at any time instruct us to discontinue our Biller Processing Service for you by logging into your processor account and following the instructions provided. Your instructions will become effective in five (5) business days or such longer period as shall be commercially reasonable under the circumstances for us, our processors and banks to act on your instructions.
---Payments Received on Your Behalf; Release of Payer . Payments under this program will be originated by any one of your Payers (our users) directing us, as your bill payment processor, to facilitate the withdrawal of funds from a Payer account to satisfy a bill payment or other debt the Payer owes to you. When Mint Bills, as your bill payment processor, receive a payment from a Payer on your behalf, you expressly agree that you have received that payment from the Payer, and as of that time, you fully release that Payer from any obligation the Payer had to you for payment in that amount. You agree that you will not thereafter attempt to collect on such obligation and will treat it as conclusively discharged.
---Certain Limitations on Transactions . Mint Bills provide our Biller Processing Service only for U.S. dollar payments made from Payers in the United States to Billers located in the United States who are engaged solely in lawful activities. Payments must be for goods sold or services rendered by the Biller. You hereby represent that you understand and meet all the criteria in this section.
---Our Rights in Cases of Fraud or Unlawful Activities . If we believe a requested payment to you may have arisen from fraud or unlawful activity or that its completion may harm us or any of our users, processors or banks, we may refuse to process that transaction or, if processed, refuse to remit such funds to you. If such a transaction has already been remitted to you, you authorize us to debit the transaction amount from your bank account within 90 days of the date the transaction was initiated. You expressly authorize us to share with law enforcement agencies any information relating to your business or our transactions with you. We may ask you for additional information about your business and transactions with us at any time, and you agree to provide it.
---Settlement . In the normal course, we will endeavor to make an electronic funds transfer to a designated bank account of yours within two to four business days after we receive payment on your behalf from one of your Payers. We may, at our sole discretion, accelerate these payments to you, but we also reserve the right to delay or withhold payments to you in accordance with the provisions of our Terms of Use.
---Transaction Confirmation and Error Reporting . When we make a payment to you, we will post a payment confirmation that you can view securely on our website. You are responsible for regularly monitoring information regarding the transactions we process for you. Except as may otherwise be provided by law, you are responsible for compiling, reconciling and retaining such information. If you believe there is an error in a transaction we have posted or that you have not received confirmation of a payment, you agree to bring this to our attention in writing through our website immediately.
---Correction of Errors . We will attempt to rectify processing errors we discover. If we determine we have paid you less than you were entitled to receive, we will send you an appropriate amount. If an error has resulted in your receiving more than you were entitled to, you agree to promptly refund the excess. You agree that we may set off any amount you owe us from future payments due to you. Failure to properly notify us within 60 days of an error first appearing in a payment confirmation we have made available to you will be deemed a waiver of any rights you may have regarding such error.
