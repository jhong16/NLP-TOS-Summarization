        <strong>THESE TERMS CONTAIN LIMITATIONS OF OATH'S LIABILITY IN <a href="#9">SECTION 9</a>.</strong>&nbsp;<br>

      <ol type="a">
        <li><em>Authority.</em> You agree that you are permitted to use the Services under applicable law. If you are
          using the Services on behalf of a company, business or other entity, you represent that you have the legal
          authority to accept these Terms on behalf of that entity, in which case that entity accepts these Terms, and

          administrator, consultant, analyst, etc.), the Terms apply to your activities on behalf of the account owner.
        </li>
        <li><em>Indemnity.</em> If you are using the Services on behalf of a company, business or other entity, or if
          you are using the Services for commercial purposes, you and the entity will hold harmless and indemnify the

          enabling you to use and enjoy the benefit of the Services as provided by Oath, in the manner permitted by
          these Terms and any additional terms or guidelines. You may not reverse engineer or attempt to extract the
          source code of our software, unless applicable laws prohibit those restrictions or you have our explicit
          written permission. Oath software may automatically download and install security or other updates without
          prior notification to you.</li>

      using the Services, you agree to our privacy policies and that Oath can use your information in accordance with

    <li><strong>Procedure for Copyright or Other Intellectual Property Infringement Claims</strong><br>
      <br>
      Oath respects the intellectual property of others, and we expect our users to do the same. Oath may, in
      appropriate circumstances and at its discretion, disable, terminate, and/or take other appropriate steps relating
      to the accounts of users who may be infringers. If you believe that your copyright or intellectual property rights
      have been infringed, please follow the instructions provided <a href="../../ip/index.html">here</a>.</li>
    <li><strong>Content in the Services and License Grant to Oath</strong>
      <ol type="a">
        <li><em>Content</em>. Our Services display some content that is not Oath’s. This content is the sole
          responsibility of the entity or person that makes it available. Oath assumes no responsibility for the conduct
          of third parties, including persons or entities with which you communicate using the Services. Many of the
          Services enable you to submit content. You – not Oath – are entirely responsible for any content that you
          upload, post, email, transmit, or otherwise make available via the Services. We may remove and refuse to
          display content that violates the Terms or applicable laws or regulations, but that does not mean that we
          monitor the Services or review or screen any content. By using or accessing the Services you understand and
          agree that you may be exposed to offensive, indecent, or objectionable content.</li>
        <li><em>IP Ownership and License Grant</em>. Except as otherwise provided in the specific Oath product terms or
          guidelines for a Service, when you upload, share with or submit content to the Services you retain ownership
          of any intellectual property rights that you hold in that content and you grant Oath a worldwide,
          royalty-free, non-exclusive, perpetual, irrevocable, transferable, sublicensable license to (a) use, host,
          store, reproduce, modify, prepare derivative works (such as translations, adaptations, summaries or other
          changes), communicate, publish, publicly perform, publicly display, and distribute this content in any manner,
          mode of delivery or media now known or developed in the future; and (b) permit other users to access,
          reproduce, distribute, publicly display, prepare derivative works of, and publicly perform your content via
          the Services, as may be permitted by the functionality of those Services (e.g., for users to re-blog, re-post
          or download your content). In some of the Services, there may be specific terms or settings allowing a
          different scope of use of the content submitted in those Services. You must have the necessary rights to grant
          us the license described in this Section 6(b)&nbsp;for any content that you upload, share with or submit to
          the Services.</li>

              it in association with other fee-based services. You are responsible for all charges even if your payment
              method fails or is denied. You authorize and direct us to retain all information about any payment
              method(s) associated with your account. We may import payment information you entered during a prior
              purchase and provide you the option to use that payment information during purchase of a new product. You
              permit us to obtain and use updated information from the issuer of your payment method in accordance with
              the policies and procedures of any applicable card brands. We may in some instances continue charging a
              payment method past its expiration date at our discretion and subject to the payment processors' or
              issuing bank's approval. Surcharges may apply if you use certain payment methods, such as payment from
              your checking or savings account.</li>
            <li><u>Payment Terms</u>. We may charge for fee-based Services in advance and on a daily, monthly, yearly,
              lump sum, or other basis in accordance with the stated terms, as long as your subscription remains active,
              even if you have not downloaded or used the Service or accessed your online account.</li>
            <li><u>Auto-Renewal</u>. We use auto-renewal for many of our fee-based Services. At the expiration of each
              subscription term for such fee-based Services, we will automatically renew your subscription and charge
              the credit card or other payment method you have provided to us, unless you cancel your subscription at
              least 48 hours before the end of the current period. Unless otherwise stated in Section 14, your
              subscription will be automatically renewed at the then-current price, excluding promotional and discount
              pricing. We may, in our sole discretion, post charges to your payment method individually or aggregate
              charges for some or all of your fee-based Services with us.</li>
            <li><u>Fraud Protection</u>. We may take steps to verify the validity of the credit card information you
              provide to us, including debiting amounts less than $1.00 from your credit card and then immediately
              crediting it back. You authorize us to do so for verification and anti-fraud purposes.</li>
            <li><u>Free Trials</u>. We may offer you free trials, so that you may try a fee-based Service subscription
              without charge or obligation ("Free Trial"). Unless otherwise stated and unless you cancel your
              subscription prior to the expiration of the Free Trial, periodic subscription fees will be charged at the
              then-applicable rate upon expiration of the Free Trial period and will continue to be charged until the
              subscription is canceled. If you are not satisfied with a particular fee-based Service, you must cancel
              the subscription before the Free Trial ends to avoid charges. We reserve the right to limit you to one
              free trial or promotion of a fee-based Service and to prohibit the combining of free trials or other
              promotional offers.</li>
            <li><u>No Refunds</u>. All charges are nonrefundable unless provided otherwise in the terms you agree to
              when you register for a fee-based Service, unless stated differently for your country in Section 15 or as
              otherwise specified below.</li>
            <li><u>Termination</u>. We, in our sole discretion, may change, discontinue or terminate any or all aspects
              of a fee-based Service without notice, including access to support services, content and other products or
              services ancillary to the fee-based Service, subject to providing an appropriate refund for any portions
              of a specified but no longer available term. You may cancel a fee-based Service at any time by logging
              into your online account and terminating the&nbsp;subscription.</li>
            <li><u>Change in Fees and Billing Method</u>. We may change our fees and billing methods at any time. We
              will provide you with notice of any price increase at least thirty (30) days in advance. Subject to
              applicable law, (i) if you disagree with any proposed change, your sole remedy is to cancel your fee-based
              Service before the price change takes effect and (ii) your continued use of or subscription to the Service
              after the price change takes effect constitutes your agreement to pay the new price for the Service.</li>
            <li><u>Delinquency</u>. After 30 days from the date of any unpaid charges, your fee-based Service will be
              deemed delinquent and we may terminate or suspend your account and fee-based Service for nonpayment. You
              are liable for any fees, including attorney and collection fees, incurred by us in our efforts to collect
              any remaining balances from you.</li>
            <li><u>90-Day Notice Period</u>. You must notify us about any billing problems or discrepancies within 90
              days after they first appear on your billing method statement. If you do not bring them to our attention
              within 90 days, you agree that you waive your right to dispute such problems or discrepancies.</li>

    <li><strong>About these Terms</strong>
      <ol type="a">
        <li><em>Third Party Beneficiaries and Conflicts</em>. These Terms control the relationship between Oath and you.
          They do not create any third party beneficiary rights. If there is a conflict or inconsistency between the
          terms in this document and the additional terms associated with a particular Service, the additional terms
          will control solely for that conflict or inconsistency.</li>
        <li><em>Modification of the Terms</em>. Unless stated differently for your country in Section 14, we may modify
          the Terms from time to time. Unless we indicate otherwise, modifications will be effective as of the date they
          are posted on this page or any successor page. You should look at the Terms regularly. We will provide notice
          (in accordance with Section 3(c) above) of material modifications.</li>
        <li><em>Continued Use of the Services</em>. You may stop using the Services at any time, but your continued use
          of or subscription to a Service after the effective date of any modifications to the Terms or the means that
          you agree to the Terms as modified.</li>
        <li><em>Waiver and Severability of Terms</em>. The failure of Oath to exercise or enforce any right or provision
          of these Terms will not constitute a waiver of such right or provision. If any provision (or part of a
          provision) of these Terms is found to be invalid, Oath and you nevertheless agree to give effect to the
          intentions as reflected in the provision, and the other provisions of these Terms remain in full force and
          effect.</li>
        <li><em>Assignment by Oath</em>. Oath may freely assign these Terms and all of the policies and other documents
          incorporated or referenced in it (including all rights, licenses, and obligations under it or them), in whole
          or in part and without notice, for any reason, including for the purpose of internal restructuring (for
          example, mergers or liquidations).</li>

        <li><strong>BINDING ARBITRATION AGREEMENT. <u>AGREEMENT TO&nbsp;ARBITRATE FOR U.S. USERS</u>. YOU AND OATH BOTH
            AGREE TO RESOLVE ANY AND ALL DISPUTES, CONTROVERSIES OR CLAIMS THAT IN ANY WAY ARISE OUT OF OR RELATE TO
            THESE TERMS OR FROM ANY SERVICES YOU RECEIVE FROM US (OR FROM ANY ADVERTISING FOR ANY SUCH SERVICES),
            INCLUDING ANY DISPUTES BETWEEN YOU AND OUR EMPLOYEES OR AGENTS (“DISPUTE(S)”), ONLY BY ARBITRATION ON AN
            INDIVIDUAL BASIS OR IN SMALL CLAIMS COURT. YOU UNDERSTAND THAT BY AGREEING TO THESE TERMS, ARBITRATION OR A
            SMALL CLAIMS ACTION WILL BE THE SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE MEANS OF RESOLVING ANY DISPUTE BETWEEN US. YOU ALSO
            UNDERSTAND THAT BY AGREEING TO THESE TERMS, YOU AND OATH ARE GIVING UP THE RIGHT TO BRING A CLAIM IN COURT
            OR IN FRONT OF A JURY (EXCEPT FOR MATTERS THAT MAY BE BROUGHT IN SMALL CLAIMS COURT), AND THAT YOU AND OATH
            ARE GIVING UP THE RIGHT TO PROCEED WITH ANY CLASS ACTION OR OTHER REPRESENTATIVE ACTION. WHILE ARBITRATION
            PROCEDURES MAY BE DIFFERENT THAN COURT PROCEDURES, AN ARBITRATOR CAN AWARD YOU INDIVIDUALLY THE SAME DAMAGES
            AND RELIEF AS A COURT, AND JUDGMENT ON THE AWARD RENDERED BY THE ARBITRATOR MAY BE ENTERED AND ENFORCED IN
            ANY COURT HAVING JURISDICTION THEREOF. THE PARTIES UNDERSTAND THAT ABSENT THIS MANDATORY PROVISION, THEY
            WOULD HAVE THE RIGHT TO SUE IN COURT AND HAVE A JURY TRIAL. THEY FURTHER UNDERSTAND THAT, IN SOME INSTANCES,
            THE COSTS OF ARBITRATION COULD EXCEED THE COSTS OF LITIGATION AND THE RIGHT TO DISCOVERY MAY BE MORE LIMITED
            IN ARBITRATION THAN IN COURT. We also both agree that:</strong>
          <ol type="i">
            <li><strong>Notice of Dispute.</strong> If either you or Oath intends to arbitrate under these Terms, the
              party seeking arbitration must first notify the other party of the Dispute in writing at least 30 days in
              advance of initiating the arbitration. Notice to Oath should be sent to Oath either by mail to Oath, Attn:
              Disputes, 701 First Avenue, Sunnyvale, CA 94089; or disputes@oath.com. Notice to you will be to your email
              address(es) and street address(es), if any, that Oath has in its records at the time the notice is sent.
              The notice must describe the nature of the claim and the relief being sought. If we are unable to resolve
              the Dispute within 30 days, either party may then proceed to file a claim for arbitration.</li>
            <li><strong>Arbitration Procedure.</strong> The Federal Arbitration Act applies to these Terms. Except for
              small claims court cases, any and all Disputes will be resolved by arbitration administered by the
              American Arbitration Association ("AAA"). The AAA will apply the <a
                href="https://adr.org/sites/default/files/Commercial%20Rules.pdf">Commercial Arbitration Rules</a> to
              the arbitration of any Dispute pursuant to these Terms, unless you are an individual and use the Services
              for personal or household use, in which case the AAA's <a
                href="https://adr.org/sites/default/files/Consumer%20Rules.pdf">Consumer Arbitration Rules</a> will
              apply (excluding any rules or procedures governing or permitting class actions). You can get procedures
              (including the process for beginning an arbitration), rules and fee information from the AAA (<a
                href="http://www.adr.org">www.adr.org</a>). These Terms govern to the extent they conflict with the
              AAA’s Commercial Arbitration Rules or Consumer Arbitration Rules.</li>
            <li><strong>Small Claims Court Option. </strong>As an alternative to arbitration, you may bring an
              individual action in small claims court in your county of residence (or if a business, your principal
              place of business) or Santa Clara County, California provided that your Dispute meets the requirements of
              the small claims court.</li>
            <li><strong>Arbitration Location.</strong> Unless you and Oath agree otherwise, the arbitration must take
              place, or the small claims action must be filed, in the county of your primary residence or Santa Clara
              County, California.</li>
            <li><strong>Arbitration Fees and Expenses.</strong> We will reimburse any filing fee that the AAA charges
              you for arbitration of the Dispute. If you provide us with signed written notice that you cannot pay the
              filing fee, we will pay the fee directly to the AAA. If the arbitration proceeds, we will also pay any
              administrative and arbitrator fees charged later.</li>
            <li><strong>Settlement Offers.</strong> We may, but are not obligated to, make a written settlement offer
              anytime before or during arbitration. The amount or terms of any settlement offer may not be disclosed to
              the arbitrator unless and until the arbitrator issues an award on the claim. If you do not accept the
              offer and the arbitrator awards you an amount of money that is more than our offer but less than $5,000,
              we agree to: (a) pay you $5,000 instead of the lower amount awarded, (b) pay your reasonable attorney’s
              fees and costs, and (c) reimburse any arbitration filing fees and arbitrator fees and expenses incurred in
              connection with the arbitration of your Dispute. If the arbitrator awards you more than $5,000 and we are
              not challenging the award, then we will pay you the amount of the award.</li>
            <li><strong>Severability. </strong>If any part of this agreement to arbitrate is found by a court of
              competent jurisdiction to be unenforceable, the court will reform the agreement to the extent necessary to
              cure the unenforceable part(s), and the parties will arbitrate their Dispute(s) without reference to or
              reliance upon the unenforceable part(s). However, if for any reason the Class Action Waiver set forth
              below in subsection 14.2.c cannot be enforced as to some or all of the Dispute, then the agreement to
              arbitrate will not apply to that Dispute or portion thereof. Any Disputes covered by any deemed
              unenforceable Class Action Waiver provision may only be litigated in a court of competent jurisdiction,
              but the remainder of the agreement to arbitrate will be binding and enforceable. To avoid any doubt or
              uncertainty, the parties do not agree to class arbitration or to the arbitration of any claims brought on
              behalf of others.</li>
          </ol>
        </li>
        <li><strong><u>CLASS ACTION WAIVER FOR U.S. USERS</u>. THESE TERMS DO <u>NOT</u> ALLOW CLASS OR COLLECTIVE
            ARBITRATIONS, EVEN IF THE AAA PROCEDURES OR RULES WOULD. NOTWITHSTANDING ANY OTHER PROVISION OF THESE TERMS,
            THE ARBITRATOR MAY AWARD MONEY OR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF ONLY IN FAVOR OF THE INDIVIDUAL PARTY SEEKING RELIEF AND
            ONLY TO THE EXTENT NECESSARY TO PROVIDE THE RELIEF WARRANTED BY THAT PARTY'S INDIVIDUAL CLAIM. ARBITRATION
            OR COURT PROCEEDINGS HELD UNDER THESE TERMS CANNOT BE BROUGHT, MAINTAINED OR RESOLVED ON BEHALF OF OR BY A
            CLASS, AS A PRIVATE ATTORNEY-GENERAL, OR IN ANY OTHER REPRESENTATIVE CAPACITY. IN ADDITION, INDIVIDUAL
            PROCEEDINGS CANNOT BE COMBINED WITHOUT THE CONSENT OF ALL OF THE PARTIES. ANY QUESTION REGARDING THE
            ENFORCEABILITY OR INTERPRETATION OF THIS PARAGRAPH WILL BE DECIDED BY A COURT AND NOT THE
            ARBITRATOR.</strong></li>
        <li><strong><u>JURY TRIAL WAIVER FOR U.S. USERS</u>. IF FOR ANY REASON A DISPUTE PROCEEDS IN COURT RATHER THAN
            THROUGH ARBITRATION, YOU AND OATH AGREE THAT THERE WILL NOT BE A JURY TRIAL. YOU AND OATH UNCONDITIONALLY
            WAIVE ANY RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION, PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM IN ANY WAY ARISING OUT OF OR
            RELATING TO THESE TERMS. IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, THIS PARAGRAPH MAY BE FILED TO SHOW A WRITTEN CONSENT
            TO A TRIAL BY THE COURT.</strong></li>
        <li><em>Choice of Law.</em> These Terms and the relationship between the parties, including any claim or dispute
          that might arise between the parties, whether sounding in contract, tort, or otherwise, will be governed by
          the laws of the State of New York without regard to its conflict of law provisions. In no event will the
          parties bring claims against one another under the laws of another jurisdiction.</li>
        <li><em>Forum</em>. If for any reason a Dispute proceeds in court rather than through arbitration, all such
          Disputes (regardless of theory) arising out of or relating to these Terms, or the relationship between you and
          Oath, will be brought exclusively in the courts located in the county of New York, New York or the U.S.
          District Court for the Southern District of New York. In such cases, you and Oath agree to submit to the
          personal jurisdiction of the courts located within the county of New York, New York or the Southern District
          of New York, and agree to waive any and all objections to the exercise of jurisdiction over the parties by
          such courts and to venue in such courts.</li>

        <li><strong>BINDING ARBITRATION AGREEMENT. <u>AGREEMENT TO ARBITRATE</u>. YOU AND OATH BOTH AGREE TO RESOLVE ANY
            AND ALL DISPUTES, CONTROVERSIES OR CLAIMS THAT IN ANY WAY ARISE OUT OF OR RELATE TO THESE TERMS OR FROM ANY
            SERVICES YOU RECEIVE FROM US (OR FROM ANY ADVERTISING FOR ANY SUCH SERVICES), INCLUDING ANY DISPUTES BETWEEN
            YOU AND OUR EMPLOYEES OR AGENTS (“DISPUTE(S)”), ONLY BY ARBITRATION ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS OR IN SMALL
            CLAIMS COURT. YOU UNDERSTAND THAT BY AGREEING TO THESE TERMS, ARBITRATION OR A SMALL CLAIMS ACTION WILL BE
            THE SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE MEANS OF RESOLVING ANY DISPUTE BETWEEN US. YOU ALSO UNDERSTAND THAT BY AGREEING TO
            THESE TERMS, YOU AND OATH ARE GIVING UP THE RIGHT TO BRING A CLAIM IN COURT OR IN FRONT OF A JURY (EXCEPT
            FOR MATTERS THAT MAY BE BROUGHT IN SMALL CLAIMS COURT), AND THAT YOU AND OATH ARE GIVING UP THE RIGHT TO
            PROCEED WITH ANY CLASS ACTION OR OTHER REPRESENTATIVE ACTION. WHILE ARBITRATION PROCEDURES MAY BE DIFFERENT
            THAN COURT PROCEDURES, AN ARBITRATOR CAN AWARD YOU INDIVIDUALLY THE SAME DAMAGES AND RELIEF AS A COURT, AND
            JUDGMENT ON THE AWARD RENDERED BY THE ARBITRATOR MAY BE ENTERED AND ENFORCED IN ANY COURT HAVING
            JURISDICTION THEREOF. THE PARTIES UNDERSTAND THAT ABSENT THIS MANDATORY PROVISION, THEY WOULD HAVE THE RIGHT
            TO SUE IN COURT AND HAVE A JURY TRIAL. THEY FURTHER UNDERSTAND THAT, IN SOME INSTANCES, THE COSTS OF
            ARBITRATION COULD EXCEED THE COSTS OF LITIGATION AND THE RIGHT TO DISCOVERY MAY BE MORE LIMITED IN
            ARBITRATION THAN IN COURT. We also both agree that:</strong>
          <ol type="i">
            <li><strong>Notice of Dispute.</strong> If either you or Oath intends to arbitrate under these Terms, the
              party seeking arbitration must first notify the other party of the Dispute in writing at least 30 days in
              advance of initiating the arbitration. Notice to Oath should be sent to Oath either by mail to Oath, Attn:
              Disputes, 701 First Avenue, Sunnyvale, CA 94089; or disputes@oath.com. Notice to you will be to your email
              address(es) and street address(es), if any, that Oath has in its records at the time the notice is sent.
              The notice must describe the nature of the claim and the relief being sought. If we are unable to resolve
              the Dispute within 30 days, either party may then proceed to file a claim for arbitration.</li>
            <li><strong>Arbitration Procedure.</strong> The Federal Arbitration Act applies to these Terms. Except for
              small claims court cases, any and all Disputes will be resolved by arbitration administered by the
              American Arbitration Association ("AAA"). The AAA will apply the <a
                href="https://adr.org/sites/default/files/Commercial%20Rules.pdf">Commercial Arbitration Rules</a> to
              the arbitration of any Dispute pursuant to these Terms, unless you are an individual and use the Services
              for personal or household use, in which case the AAA's <a
                href="https://adr.org/sites/default/files/Consumer%20Rules.pdf">Consumer Arbitration Rules</a> will
              apply (excluding any rules or procedures governing or permitting class actions). You can get procedures
              (including the process for beginning an arbitration), rules and fee information from the AAA (<a
                href="http://www.adr.org">www.adr.org</a>). These Terms govern to the extent they conflict with the
              AAA’s Commercial Arbitration Rules or Consumer Arbitration Rules.</li>
            <li><strong>Small Claims Court Option.</strong> As an alternative to arbitration, you may bring an
              individual action in small claims court in your county of residence (or if a business, your principal
              place of business) or Santa Clara County, California provided that your Dispute meets the requirements of
              the small claims court.</li>
            <li><strong>Arbitration Location. </strong>Unless you and Oath agree otherwise, the arbitration must take
              place, or the small claims action must be filed, in the county of your primary residence or Santa Clara
              County, California.</li>
            <li><strong>Arbitration Fees and Expenses.</strong> We will reimburse any filing fee that the AAA charges
              you for arbitration of the Dispute. If you provide us with signed written notice that you cannot pay the
              filing fee, we will pay the fee directly to the AAA. If the arbitration proceeds, we will also pay any
              administrative and arbitrator fees charged later.</li>
            <li><strong>Settlement Offers.</strong> We may, but are not obligated to, make a written settlement offer
              anytime before or during arbitration. The amount or terms of any settlement offer may not be disclosed to
              the arbitrator unless and until the arbitrator issues an award on the claim. If you do not accept the
              offer and the arbitrator awards you an amount of money that is more than our offer but less than $5,000,
              we agree to: (a) pay you $5,000 instead of the lower amount awarded, (b) pay your reasonable attorney’s
              fees and costs, and (c) reimburse any arbitration filing fees and arbitrator fees and expenses incurred in
              connection with the arbitration of your Dispute. If the arbitrator awards you more than $5,000 and we are
              not challenging the award, then we will pay you the amount of the award.</li>
            <li><strong>Severability.</strong> If any part of this agreement to arbitrate is found by a court of
              competent jurisdiction to be unenforceable, the court will reform the agreement to the extent necessary to
              cure the unenforceable part(s), and the parties will arbitrate their Dispute(s) without reference to or
              reliance upon the unenforceable part(s). However, if for any reason the Class Action Waiver set forth
              below in subsection 14.3.c cannot be enforced as to some or all of the Dispute, then the agreement to
              arbitrate will not apply to that Dispute or portion thereof. Any Disputes covered by any deemed
              unenforceable Class Action Waiver provision may only be litigated in a court of competent jurisdiction,
              but the remainder of the agreement to arbitrate will be binding and enforceable. To avoid any doubt or
              uncertainty, the parties do not agree to class arbitration or to the arbitration of any claims brought on
              behalf of others.</li>
          </ol>
        </li>
        <li><strong><u>CLASS ACTION WAIVER</u>. THESE TERMS DO <u>NOT</u> ALLOW CLASS OR COLLECTIVE ARBITRATIONS, EVEN
            IF THE AAA PROCEDURES OR RULES WOULD. NOTWITHSTANDING ANY OTHER PROVISION OF THESE TERMS, THE ARBITRATOR MAY
            AWARD MONEY OR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF ONLY IN FAVOR OF THE INDIVIDUAL PARTY SEEKING RELIEF AND ONLY TO THE EXTENT
            NECESSARY TO PROVIDE THE RELIEF WARRANTED BY THAT PARTY'S INDIVIDUAL CLAIM. ARBITRATION OR COURT PROCEEDINGS
            HELD UNDER THESE TERMS CANNOT BE BROUGHT, MAINTAINED OR RESOLVED ON BEHALF OF OR BY A CLASS, AS A PRIVATE
            ATTORNEY-GENERAL, OR IN ANY OTHER REPRESENTATIVE CAPACITY. IN ADDITION, INDIVIDUAL PROCEEDINGS CANNOT BE
            COMBINED WITHOUT THE CONSENT OF ALL OF THE PARTIES. ANY QUESTION REGARDING THE ENFORCEABILITY OR
            INTERPRETATION OF THIS PARAGRAPH WILL BE DECIDED BY A COURT AND NOT THE ARBITRATOR.</strong></li>
        <li><strong><u>JURY TRIAL WAIVER</u>. IF FOR ANY REASON A DISPUTE PROCEEDS IN COURT RATHER THAN THROUGH
            ARBITRATION, YOU AND OATH AGREE THAT THERE WILL NOT BE A JURY TRIAL. YOU AND OATH UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVE ANY
            RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION, PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM IN ANY WAY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO
            THESE TERMS. IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, THIS PARAGRAPH MAY BE FILED TO SHOW A WRITTEN CONSENT TO A TRIAL BY
            THE COURT.</strong></li>
        <li><em>Choice of Law</em>. These Terms and the relationship between the parties, including any claim or dispute
          that might arise between the parties, whether sounding in contract, tort, or otherwise, will be governed by
          the laws of the State of New York without regard to its conflict of law provisions. In no event will the
          parties bring claims against one another under the laws of another jurisdiction.</li>
        <li><em>Forum</em>. If for any reason a Dispute proceeds in court rather than through arbitration, all such
          Disputes (regardless of theory) arising out of or relating to these Terms, or the relationship between you and
          Oath, will be brought exclusively in the courts located in the county of New York, New York or the U.S.
          District Court for the Southern District of New York. In such cases, you and Oath agree to submit to the
          personal jurisdiction of the courts located within the county of New York, New York or the Southern District
          of New York, and agree to waive any and all objections to the exercise of jurisdiction over the parties by
          such courts and to venue in such courts.</li>

              later than 14 days from the day on which we received your cancellation notification. Unless you expressly
              agree otherwise, we will use the same means of payment as used for the initial transaction. You agree that
