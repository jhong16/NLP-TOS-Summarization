Whenever you buy groceries with Apple Pay, send an iMessage to a friend, or make a FaceTime call, your data is encrypted.
Neither Apple nor your device shares actual credit card numbers.
If an app you've installed on your device wants to access personal information like photos or contacts, you're prompted to give permission.
Whether you're taking a photo, asking Siri a question, or getting directions, you can do it knowing that Apple does n't gather your personal information to sell.
And when you use Apple Pay Cash, information is stored for fraud prevention, troubleshooting, and regulatory purposes.
When we use data to create better experiences for you, we work hard to do it.
Privacy.
