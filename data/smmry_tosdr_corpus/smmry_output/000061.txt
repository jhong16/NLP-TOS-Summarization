Privacy - Apple Whether you're taking a photo, asking Siri a question, or getting directions, you can do it knowing that Apple doesn't gather your personal information to sell to advertisers or other organizations.

Apple Pay gives you a safer, more private way to pay in stores, in apps, and on the web.

Neither Apple nor your device shares actual credit card numbers with merchants.

Whenever you buy groceries with Apple Pay, send an iMessage to a friend, or make a FaceTime call, your data is encrypted for your protection.

If we learn that an app violates these guidelines, the developer must address the issue or face removal from the App Store.

If an app you've installed on your device wants to access personal information like photos or contacts, you're prompted to give permission first.
