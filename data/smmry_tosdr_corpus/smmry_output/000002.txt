Providing Personal Information and Non-Identifying Information enables you to derive more benefit from the Academia.

The same pieces of information are considered Non-Identifying Information when they are taken alone or combined only with other non-identifying information.

We may combine your Personal Information with Non-Identifying Information and aggregate it with information collected from other Academia.

We may receive information about you from other sources, including through third-party services and organizations, to supplement information provided by you.

Information we collect through App Stores or SNS accounts may include your name, your SNS user identification number, your SNS user name, location, sex, birth date, email, profile picture, and your contacts on the SNS. This supplemental information allows us to verify information that you have provided to Academia.

We may share aggregated information that does not include Personal Information and we may otherwise disclose Non-Identifying Information and Log Data with third parties for industry analysis, demographic profiling and other purposes.

Edu is Processing Personal Information about you, request access to Personal Information, and ask that we correct, amend or delete your Personal Information where it is inaccurate.[BREAK]
