Your representations By applying to register a domain name, or by asking us to maintain or renew a domain name registration, you hereby represent and warrant to us that the statements that you made in your Registration Agreement are complete and accurate; to your knowledge, the registration of the domain name will not infringe upon or otherwise violate the rights of any third party; you are not registering the domain name for an unlawful purpose; and you will not knowingly use the domain name in violation of any applicable laws or regulations.

You are required to submit to a mandatory administrative proceeding in the event that a third party asserts to the applicable Provider, in compliance with the Rules of Procedure, that your domain name is identical or confusingly similar to a trademark or service mark in which the complainant has rights; and you have no rights or legitimate interests in respect of the domain name; and your domain name has been registered and is being used in bad faith.

Any of the following circumstances, in particular but without limitation, if found by the Panel to be proved based on its evaluation of all evidence presented, shall demonstrate your rights or legitimate interests to the domain name for purposes of Paragraph 4(a)(ii): before any notice to you of the dispute, your use of, or demonstrable preparations to use, the domain name or a name corresponding to the domain name in connection with a bona fide offering of goods or services; or you have been commonly known by the domain name, even if you have acquired no trademark or service mark rights; or you are making a legitimate noncommercial or fair use of the domain name, without intent for commercial gain to misleadingly divert consumers or to tarnish the trademark or service mark at issue.

The remedies available to a complainant pursuant to any proceeding before an Administrative Panel shall be limited to requiring the cancellation of your domain name or the transfer of your domain name registration to the complainant.

Transfers during a dispute Transfers of a Domain Name to a New Holder You may not transfer your domain name registration to another holder during a pending administrative proceeding brought pursuant to Paragraph 4 or for a period of fifteen business days after such proceeding is concluded; or during a pending court proceeding or arbitration commenced regarding your domain name unless the party to whom the domain name registration is being transferred agrees, in writing, to be bound by the decision of the court or arbitrator.

You may transfer administration of your domain name registration to another registrar during a pending court action or arbitration, provided that the domain name you have registered with us shall continue to be subject to the proceedings commenced against you in accordance with the terms of this Policy.

In the event that you transfer a domain name registration to us during the pendency of a court action or arbitration, such dispute shall remain subject to the domain name dispute policy of the registrar from which the domain name registration was transferred.[BREAK]
