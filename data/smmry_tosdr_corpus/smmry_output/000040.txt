The Flickr Services are only available for purchase in U.S. dollars and are offered by Oath's U.S.-based Flickr service.

CONTENT: IP OWNERSHIP AND LICENSE GRANT If you agreed to a version of the Oath Terms of Service that was last modified on or after March 23, 2018 , the following section applies to you: These additional terms for Flickr Pro subscribers are in addition to Oath's Terms of Service and, for Flickr Pro subscribers these terms supersede Oath's Terms of Service only as to the IP Ownership and License Grant in Section 6(b) of Oath's Terms of Service.

If you do not cancel the Flickr Service you ordered by the end of the current term, your credit card on file will also automatically be charged the then-current fee for that Flickr Service at the commencement of each renewal term.

Flickr Gift Certificates can only be purchased on the Flickr site, and a particular gift certificate may only be applied toward the purchase of the Flickr service for which it is being offered.

Flickr Gift Certificates may not be used to purchase other Flickr Gift Certificates or any other Oath Services or Oath Gift Certificates.

A Flickr Gift Certificate is non-transferable, and resale of a Flickr Gift Certificate or use for unauthorized advertising, marketing, sweepstakes or other promotional purposes is strictly prohibited.

In the unlikely event that your Flickr Gift Certificate is not received and accepted by your intended recipient twelve months from the date that your payment for such gift certificate is finalized, then the Flickr Gift Certificate will be applied to your own Flickr account.
