Limitations on Automated Use: You may not, without express prior written permission, do any of the following while accessing or using the Services: tamper with, or use non-public areas of the Services, or the computer or delivery systems of Tumblr and/or its service providers; probe, scan, or test any system or network, or otherwise attempt to breach or circumvent any security or authentication measures; access or search or attempt to access or search the Services by any means other than through our currently available, published interfaces that are provided by Tumblr or unless permitted by Tumblr's robots.

Subscriber Content License to Tumblr: When you provide Subscriber Content to Tumblr through the Services, you grant Tumblr a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free, sublicensable, transferable right and license to use, host, store, cache, reproduce, publish, display, perform, distribute, transmit, modify, adapt, and create derivative works of, such Subscriber Content.

If you develop software or services based on the Services or any Content, whether using the Tumblr Application Programming Interface or not, you will agree to and comply with the Tumblr Application Developer and API License Agreement.

Any use of Tumblr's trademarks, branding, logos, and other such assets in connection with the Services shall use Tumblr's approved branding and shall be in accordance with the Tumblr Trademark Guidelines.
