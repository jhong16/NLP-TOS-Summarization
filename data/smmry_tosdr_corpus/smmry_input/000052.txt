FEES AND PAYMENTS

(A) GENERAL TERMS, INCLUDING AUTOMATIC RENEWAL TERMS

You agree to pay any and all prices and fees due for Services purchased or obtained at this Site at the time you order the Services.  
GoDaddy expressly reserves the right to change or modify its prices and fees at any time, and such changes or modifications shall be posted online at this Site and effective immediately without need for further notice to you.  
If you have purchased or obtained Services for a period of months or years, changes or modifications in prices and fees shall be effective when the Services in question come up for renewal as further described below. 

Unless otherwise specifically noted (for reasons such as those highlighted in Section 2(x) above), the renewal price for any domain name in any TLD will be the same as the list (non-sale) price shown when you search for and select a domain, and again in the cart prior to purchase.  
For example, if the list price is $9.99, and a different renewal price is not specifically identified, then the renewal price is also $9.99.  
Likewise, if a domain name has a sale price of $8.99, with the list (non-sale) price shown (as a strike-through) at $9.99, the renewal price will be $9.99*.  

*
Renewal price subject to change prior to actual date of renewal.  

For all other terms and conditions relating to fees, payment, refund and billing, etc.
applicable to the Services offered under the scope of this Agreement, please refer to the "Fees and Payments" section of our UTOS. 

(B) DOMAIN NAME RENEWAL TERMS

When you register a domain name, you will have three renewal options: (i)
"
Automatic Renewal" (ii)
"Extended Automatic Renewal", and (iii)
"Manual Renewal": 
---Automatic Renewal.  
Automatic Renewal is the default setting.
Therefore, unless you select Extended Automatic Renewal, GoDaddy will enroll you in Automatic Renewal.  
Domain names will automatically renew, for a period equivalent to the length of your original domain name registration, any domain name that is up for renewal and will take payment from the Payment Method you have on file with GoDaddy, at GoDaddy's then current rates.
Thus, if you have chosen to register your domain name for one (1) year, GoDaddy will automatically renew it for one (1) year.
If you have chosen to register your domain name for two (2) years, GoDaddy will automatically renew it for two (2) years, and so on.

---Extended Automatic Renewal.  
If you enroll in the Extended Automatic Renewal plan, GoDaddy will automatically renew any domain name that is up for renewal for an additional one-year period on each and every anniversary of your domain name registration, so the initial registration period will always remain intact.  
Thus, if you have chosen to register your domain name for two (2) years, GoDaddy will automatically renew it for one (1) additional year on each and every anniversary of your domain name registration so your two (2) year registration period will always remain intact.
If you have chosen to register your domain name for five (5) years, GoDaddy will automatically renew it for one (1) additional year on each and every anniversary of your domain name registration
so your five (5) year registration period will always remain intact, and so on.  
GoDaddy will take payment from the Payment Method you have on file with GoDaddy, at GoDaddy's then current one-year domain name registration rate.

---Manual
Renewal.  
If you have elected to turn off automatic renewal and cancel the product (i.e., cancel the domain name registration) effective at expiration of the then current term, you may nonetheless elect to manually renew the domain name at anytime prior to its expiration date by logging into your Account Manager and manually implementing the renewal or by calling customer service
(should you in fact want the domain name to be renewed).
If you fail to manually implement the renewal before the expiration date, the domain name will be cancelled and you will no longer have use of that name.

All renewals will be subject to the terms of this Agreement, as it may be amended from time to time, and you acknowledge and agree to be bound by the terms of this Agreement (as amended) for all renewed domains.  
Domain name renewals will be non-refundable.
In the event that we are unable to automatically renew your domain name for the renewal option selected for any reason, we may automatically renew your domain name for a period less than your original registration period to the extent necessary for the transaction to succeed.
If for any reason GoDaddy is not able to take the payment from the Payment Method you have on file, and you fail to respond to our notices, your domain name registration will expire.
It is your responsibility to keep your Payment Method information current, which includes the expiration date if you are using a credit card.

For certain ccTLDs (.am, .at
, .be,
.br,
.cn,
.com.cn, .net.cn, .org.cn,
.de,
.eu,
.fm, .fr,
.gs,
.it, .jp,

.net.nz,
.org.nz, .se, .tc,
.tk,
.tw,
.com.tw,
.org.tw, .idv.tw, .uk, .us, and
.vg), renewal billing will occur on the first day of the month prior to the month of expiration.

For certain ccTLDs (.am, .at
, .be,
.ca,
.cn,
.com.cn, .net.cn, .org.cn,
.de,
.eu,
.fm, .gs,
.it, .jp, .ms, .nu,

.co.nz,
.net.nz,
.org.nz,
.tc,
.tk,
.tw,
.com.tw,
.org.tw, .idv.tw, .uk, and
.vg), renewal will occur, or must occur manually if the product was previously cancelled, no later than the 20th of the month prior to the expiration date, or your domain name will be placed in non-renewal status.
For some ccTLDs (.es) renewal must be processed no later than seven days before the expiration date, or your domain name will be placed in non-renewal status.  
When the domain name is in non-renewal status, you can renew the domain name only by calling GoDaddy and requesting that the domain name be renewed.
You cannot renew the domain name through your Account Manager.
If you fail to manually implement the renewal of any cancelled product before the expiration date, the domain name will be cancelled and you will no longer have use of that name.

You agree that GoDaddy will not be responsible for cancelled domain names that you fail to renew in the timeframes indicated in this Agreement.
In any case, if you fail to renew your domain name in a timely fashion, additional charges may apply.
If you signed up for privacy services, protected registration, or any other similar service, with your domain name registration, these services will automatically be renewed when your domain name registration is up for renewal, and you will incur the applicable additional renewal fee unless you cancel in advance. 

If you fail to renew your domain name in the timeframes indicated in this Agreement, you agree that GoDaddy may, in its sole discretion, renew your expired domain name on your behalf.
If GoDaddy decides to renew your expired domain name on your behalf, you will have a Renewal Grace Period during which you may reimburse GoDaddy for the renewal and keep your domain name.
The Renewal Grace Period is currently twelve (12) days but subject to change under the terms of this Agreement.
For certain ccTLDs (.am, .at, .be, .cn, .com.cn, .net.cn, .org.cn, .de,
.eu,
.fm, .gs,
.it, .jp, .ms, .nu,
.nz,
.co.nz,
.net.nz,
.org.nz,
.tc,
.tk,
.tw,
.com.tw,
.org.tw, .idv.tw, .uk, and
.vg) there is no Renewal Grace Period after the expiration date of the domain name.
If you do not reimburse GoDaddy for the renewal during the Renewal Grace Period your domain name will be placed on Hold and flagged for deletion after which you may have up to a 30-day redemption period to redeem your domain name, provided that your domain name is not subject to an expired domain name auction bid and you pay GoDaddy a Redemption fee.
The Redemption fee is currently $80.00 USD and is subject to change under the terms of this Agreement.
If you do not redeem your domain name prior to the end of the 30-day redemption period GoDaddy may, in its sole discretion, delete your domain name or transfer it to another registrant on your behalf.  
During the redemption period your domain name may be parked. 

If your domain name is deleted, the Registry also provides a 30-day Redemption Grace Period during which you may pay GoDaddy a redemption fee and redeem your domain name.
The redemption fee is currently $80.00 USD and is subject to change under the terms of this Agreement.
If you do not redeem your domain name prior to the end of the Registry's Redemption Grace Period the Registry will release your name and it will become available for registration on a first-come-first-served basis.

Renewal Grace Periods and Redemption Grace Periods vary for different ccTLDs.
Please refer to the specific terms for the applicable TLD.
In the event there is a conflict between the provisions of this paragraph and the ccTLD terms, the ccTLD terms shall control.

Our registration expiration notification policy and associated fees are described here.

(C)
FREE PRODUCT TERMS

In the event you are provided with free products with the registration of a domain name, you acknowledge and agree that such free products will only be available with a valid purchase and may be terminated in the event the domain name is deleted or cancelled.  
For free domain names, you acknowledge and agree that you may not change the account associated with such free domain for the first five (5) days after registration.  
In the event a free domain name is offered with the registration of another domain and if the paid domain name registered fails, then we may, in its sole discretion, either delete the registration of the free domain or refund the difference between the amount paid and the value of the free domain.  
Failed registrations associated with promotionals offers may result in the deletion of the free or discounted item or an adjustment between the registered domain price and the value of the discounted item, in our sole discretion.

4.
TERM OF AGREEMENT; TRANSFERS; DOMAIN TASTING

The term of this Agreement shall continue in full force and effect as long as you have any domain name registered through GoDaddy.

You agree that you will not transfer any domain name registered through GoDaddy to another domain name registrar during the first sixty (60) days after its initial registration date.  
You agree that you may not transfer any domain name for ten (10) days after a Change of Account.

You further agree that you will not engage in "domain tasting" by using the five (5) day grace period in which a registrant may choose to cancel a domain name and get a full refund of the registration fee as a vehicle to test the marketability or viability of a domain name.  
If GoDaddy determines (which determination shall be made by GoDaddy in its sole and absolute discretion) that you have been engaging in "domain tasting", then GoDaddy reserves the right to (a) charge you a small fee (which fee shall be deducted from any refund issued) or (b) refuse your cancellation/refund request altogether.
GoDaddy will not charge you a fee if GoDaddy cancels your domain name during the five (5) day grace period due to fraud or other activity outside of your control.
The five (5) day grace period does not apply to Premium Domains, which are non-refundable.

You agree that GoDaddy shall not be bound by (i) any representations made by third parties who you may use to purchase services from GoDaddy, or (ii) any statements of a general nature, which may be posted on GoDaddy's website or contained in GoDaddy's promotional materials.

Failure by you, for whatever reason, to provide GoDaddy with accurate and reliable information on an initial and continual basis, shall be considered to be a material breach of this Agreement and a basis for suspension and/or cancellation of the domain name.
Failure by you, for whatever reason, to respond within five (5) business days to any inquiries made by GoDaddy to determine the validity of information provided by you, shall also be considered to be a material breach of this Agreement and a basis for suspension and/or cancellation of the domain name.

DEFAULT SETTINGS; PARKED PAGE
Choosing Your Domain Name Settings.  
When you register a domain name with GoDaddy, you will be prompted to choose your domain name settings during the checkout process.  
If you plan on using another provider for your website or hosting needs, then you should enter the name servers of such provider when you choose your domain name settings.  
This will direct your domain name away from GoDaddy’s name servers.  
If you are an existing GoDaddy customer and have already set up a customer profile designating your domain name settings for new domain name registrations, you will not need to complete this step again during the checkout process.   

GoDaddy’s Default Settings.  
If you do not direct your domain name away from GoDaddy’s name servers as described above, GoDaddy will direct your domain name to a "Parked Page" ("Default Setting").  
You acknowledge and agree that GoDaddy has the right to set the Default Setting. 

Parked Page Default Setting.  
GoDaddy’s Parked Page service is an online domain monetization system designed to generate revenue (through the use of pay per click advertising) from domain names that are not actively being used as websites.  
If your domain name is directed to a Parked Page, you acknowledge and agree that GoDaddy may display both (a) in-house advertising (which includes links to GoDaddy products and services) and (b) third-party advertising (which includes links to third-party products and services) on your Parked Page through the use of pop-up or pop-under browser windows, banner advertisements, audio or video streams, or any other advertising means, and we may aggregate for our own use, related usage data by means of cookies and other similar means.  
In addition, you acknowledge and agree that all in-house and third-party advertising will be selected by GoDaddy and its advertising partners, as appropriate, and you will not be permitted to customize the advertising, or entitled to any compensation in exchange therefor.  
Please note that the third-party advertising displayed on GoDaddy’s Parked Pages may contain content offensive to you, including but not limited to links to adult content.  
GoDaddy makes no effort to edit, control, monitor, or restrict the content and third-party advertising displayed on GoDaddy’s Parked Pages, and expressly disclaims any liability or responsibility to you or any third party in connection therewith.

Changing GoDaddy’s Default Settings.  
You may change GoDaddy’s Default Settings at any time during the term of your domain name registration.

---Content
Displaying On Your Parked Page.  
You can not modify the content displaying on your Parked Page.  
You may select one of the other options listed below.

---Participating In Domain Name Monetization.  
If you wish to participate in the domain monetization potential presented by GoDaddy’s Parked Page service, please review and consider purchasing our CashParking® service.   

---No Content.  
If the options listed above are not acceptable to you, please contact customer support to learn what other options might be available to you.

Return To Parked
Page Default Setting Upon Domain Name Expiration.  
Upon domain name expiration, and regardless of how you use your domain name during the term of your domain name registration, your domain name will automatically return to the Parked Page Default Setting described above.  
As used in this paragraph, "expiration" is deemed to include any "renewal period" or "redemption period" immediately after the domain name expires, but before the domain name is returned to the registry.  
Once your domain name has returned to the Parked Page Default Setting described above, the only way to opt out of the Parked Page service is to renew, redeem, or re-register your domain name in accordance with Section 2(B),
Domain Name Renewal Terms, of this Agreement.

Certified Domains.  
The certified domain service generally allow You to: (i) put a Certified Domain Validation seal on Your website; and (ii) have Your domain name listed as "Certified", in WHOIS lookups on our website.   
The Certified Domain Validation seal renews independently of Your domain.
When You renew Your domain, You must also, when necessary, separately renew Your Certified Validation seal.
However, the Certified Domain Validation seal can be cancelled independently of Your domain.
If the domain is cancelled, the Certified Domain associated with the cancelled domain will automatically cancel.  
The Certified Domain seal is a trademark and is protected by copyright, trademark and other intellectual property laws.
You may use the Certified Domain seal only in conjunction with the purchase of the Services set forth in the Agreement, and subject to the terms and conditions hereof.
Other than provided for in this Agreement, You may not otherwise use, reproduce, or modify the mark for any additional promotional use, without our prior written approval.

Once the service has been used to consolidate domains, the new expiration date may not be reversed.
To ensure the service is not abused or used as an alternative to renewals, you may only use the service on each domain once in any 12-month period.
The service may only be used on domain names that have not passed their expiration date.
In order to change the expiration date again, You will be required to renew the domain name first.

Backordering/Monitoring.  
You agree a domain name that has expired shall be subject first to a grace period of twelve (12) days, followed by the ICANN-mandated redemption grace period of thirty (30) days.
During this period of time, the current domain name registrant may renew the domain name and retain registration rights.
We do not guarantee your backorder will result in you obtaining the domain name and expressly reserves the right to (a) refuse additional backorders or (b) cancel existing backorders at any time for any reason.  
If your backorder is refused or cancelled, we agree to promptly refund any fees paid for such domain name backorder.
The domain name may also be placed in a secondary market for resale through the Auctions® service.  
After your first year of Auctions membership, you agree that unless otherwise advised, we will automatically renew your Auctions membership using the payment method you have on file for so long as your backorder credit is active.
You may learn more about Auctions by visiting the Auctions website.
The domain name may also be subject to a drop pool process before it is available for purchasing.
You understand we and our registrar affiliates use our services, including backordering.  
Therefore, the domain name may be registered with a different registrar, but can be managed through your account.  
By using the Services, you will be able to, among other things:
---Backorder any domain name under the top level domains .COM, .NET,

You will have the opportunity to change the credit to a different domain name until you successfully capture one.
After three (3) years, if the credit is not used, we reserves the right to remove the credit.

You may also choose to purchase a subscription to a list of domain names expiring within the next five (5) days.
If you subscribe to the expiring domain name list, you agree the payment method you have on file may be charged on a monthly subscription basis for the term of the Services you purchase.

---Select domain names off the expiring domain name list you would like to register.
Each domain name you attempt to backorder will include the price of up to a one-year domain name registration, as set forth in subsection (i) above.

Registration Rights Protection.  
The Rights Protection Service ("the Service") generally allows You to: (i) protect against losing a domain name; (ii) disallow the transfer of a domain name from registrar to registrar or registrant to registrant while this Service is active on that name; and (iii) receive an annual domain name report detailing the status of all domain names protected under this Service.
THE SERVICE WILL NOT, HOWEVER, PREVENT TRANSFERS RESULTING FROM THE SALE OF PREMIUM DOMAIN NAMES
OR
FROM YOUR ACTION OF LISTING A DOMAIN NAME FOR SALE ON ANY OF GoDaddy'S PLATFORMS, REGARDLESS OF WHEN YOU PURCHASED REGISTATION RIGHTS PROTECTION SERVICE.
Once You have elected to purchase the Service for any and all domain names, the automatic renewal function will be activated for each domain name and those names will not be transferable until the renewal of the Service or until you sell the Premium domain name.
Accordingly, You acknowledge and agree You have carefully considered the implications accompanying the purchase of the Service and understand the restrictions the Service will place upon Your ability to transfer any domain names for which You have purchased the Service.
You further acknowledge and agree any domain name for which You have purchased the Service will not be transferable for any reason, with the exception of selling Premium domain names, until the next regularly occurring renewal of such domain name, provided, You have previously elected to deactivate the Service for that particular domain name, which deactivation may not occur until the expiration of the current term of the Service.
By way of example and not as a limitation, if You elect to purchase the Service for a domain name, which You have registered for a period of five (5) years, the Service will remain active for the same five (5) year period and You will not be able to engage in any transfer of that domain name during such five (5) year period.

.CA
ASCII and IDN domain variants are bundled and reserved for a single registrant.  
Registrants are not required to register all variants in a bundle, but all registered variants must be registered and managed at a single registrar.
Each variant registered will incur a registration fee.  
In addition, when registering multiple .CA domain (ASCII and IDN) variants in a bundle, your registrant information must be identical.  
If variants are registered at other registrars or if registrant information does not match, it may result in an "unavailable" search result, delayed or failed registration.
If information does not match, validation is required and may take up to seven business days and delay availability of domain. 

(C) PROVISIONS SPECIFIC
TO .CN
REGISTRATIONS 

.CN is a restricted TLD – applications are subject to both a domain name check and real name verification as required by the People’s Republic of China.  
Registrations in .CN are therefore subject to the following additional terms:
Verification, Registration and Activation.  
If a domain name is not permitted to be registered by the Chinese government, as determined by us, the Registry Operator and/or a 3rd party provider utilized for such services and determinations, in either party’s discretion, the application for registration will not be successful.  
In such event, the name will be deleted and you will be eligible for a refund as further described below.

If permitted, then the Registration may proceed, but a .CN domain name may not be activated (i.e., it will not resolve in the Internet) unless and until you have submitted (via the process described during registration) valid documents required of us and the Registry to perform real name verification.  
The following are acceptable forms of documents for the purpose of verification:
---China: Resident ID, temporary resident ID, business license or organization code certificate

---Hong
Kong/Macau: Resident ID, driver’s license, passport or business license
---Singapore:
Driver’s license, passport or business license
---Taiwan:
Resident ID, driver’s license or business license
---Other
Countries/Regions:
Driver’s license or passport
Documents submitted to us are used by us and shared with the Registry solely for the purpose of real name verification, and are otherwise subject to our Privacy Policy.  
By registering a .CN domain, you expressly agree that your data may be stored on servers in the U.S., or otherwise outside of the People's Republic of China.

Refunds.  
Refunds for .CN
Registrations will only be allowed where (i) registration of the applied for domain name is not permitted by the Chinese government; or (ii) you notify us of your intent to cancel for any reason within the first five (5) days after the Registration (i.e., after it is deemed permissible by the Chinese government).  
For the avoidance of doubt, refunds will not be permitted under any circumstances after five (5) days from the date of Registration, including, for example, in the event real name verification is not successful or if the Chinese government determines after Registration that the domain name should not have been registered (and directs us to delete).

(D)
