Last updated: January 08th, 2018ResearchGate was developed by scientists to enable collaboration, sharing of content and communication among scientists, researchers, authors, institutions and other professionals.

We have a process for submitting complaints regarding content posted by our members.

 Rather, you make the content available to the public through ResearchGate.

You retain the right to remove such content from ResearchGate at any time, or to archive your content so it is available only to you and your co-author(s).

 You may also remove content from appearing on your profile page.

Our platform enables the private archiving and public posting of various types of content.

If you choose to privately archive or publicly post content, we encourage you to first confirm your rights before doing so.[BREAK]
