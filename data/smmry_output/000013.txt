APPLE IDUsing our Services and accessing your Content requires an Apple ID. An Apple ID is the account you use across Apple's ecosystem.

Apple is not responsible for any losses arising from the unauthorized use of your Apple ID. Please contact Apple if you suspect that your Apple ID has been compromised.

If a Content provider delivers to Apple fewer TV episodes than planned when you purchased a Season Pass, we will credit to your Apple ID the retail value of the corresponding number of episodes that were not provided to Apple.

H. ADDITIONAL APPLE BOOKS TERMSYou acquire Apple Books Content from the third-party provider of such Content, not Apple.

Apple acts as an agent for the Publisher in providing Apple Books Content to you, and therefore Apple is not a party to the Transaction between you and the Publisher.

If you are a customer of Apple Distribution International, the merchant of record is Apple Distribution International, which means that you acquire a license to use the Content from Apple Distribution International, but the Content is licensed by the Publisher.

The Apple name, the Apple logo, iTunes, iTunes Store, App Store, Apple Books, Apple Music, and other Apple trademarks, service marks, graphics, and logos used in connection with the Services are trademarks or registered trademarks of Apple in the U.S. and other countries throughout the world.[BREAK]
