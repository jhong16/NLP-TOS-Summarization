Steam Refunds You can request a refund for nearly any purchase on Steam-for any reason.

 There are more details below, but even if you fall outside of the refund rules we've described, you can ask for a refund anyway and we'll take a look.

 Steam will offer refund for in-game purchases within any Valve-developed games within forty-eight hours of purchase, so long as the in-game item has not been consumed, modified or transferred.

 You may request a refund for Steam Wallet funds within fourteen days of purchase if they were purchased on Steam and if you have not used any of those funds.

 Within thirty days after delivery, you may request a refund for Steam hardware and accessories purchased via Steam for any reason.

 Unredeemed gifts may be refunded within the standard 14-day/two-hour refund period.

 Redeemed gifts may be refunded under the same conditions if the gift recipient initiates the refund.
