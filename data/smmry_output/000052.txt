If you do not reimburse GoDaddy for the renewal during the Renewal Grace Period your domain name will be placed on Hold and flagged for deletion after which you may have up to a 30-day redemption period to redeem your domain name, provided that your domain name is not subject to an expired domain name auction bid and you pay GoDaddy a Redemption fee.

In the event a free domain name is offered with the registration of another domain and if the paid domain name registered fails, then we may, in its sole discretion, either delete the registration of the free domain or refund the difference between the amount paid and the value of the free domain.

In the event you are purchasing a domain name on behalf of a third party, you agree to inform any customer of yours, who may be acquiring a domain name through you using GoDaddy's registration services, that they are in fact registering their domain name through GoDaddy and that GoDaddy is an accredited registrar with ICANN. You agree not to represent that you are an ICANN-accredited registrar or that you are in any way providing superior access to the ICANN Domain Name Registry.

Upon domain name expiration, and regardless of how you use your domain name during the term of your domain name registration, your domain name will automatically return to the Parked Page Default Setting described above.

THE SERVICE WILL NOT PREVENT TRANSFERS RESULTING FROM THE SALE OF PREMIUM DOMAIN NAMES OR FROM YOUR ACTION OF LISTING A DOMAIN NAME FOR SALE ON ANY OF GoDaddy'S PLATFORMS, REGARDLESS OF WHEN YOU PURCHASED REGISTATION RIGHTS PROTECTION SERVICE. Once You have elected to purchase the Service for any and all domain names, the automatic renewal function will be activated for each domain name and those names will not be transferable until the renewal of the Service or until you sell the Premium domain name.

You further acknowledge and agree any domain name for which You have purchased the Service will not be transferable for any reason, with the exception of selling Premium domain names, until the next regularly occurring renewal of such domain name, provided, You have previously elected to deactivate the Service for that particular domain name, which deactivation may not occur until the expiration of the current term of the Service.
