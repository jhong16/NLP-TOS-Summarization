Please do not submit any Unsolicited Content to Rovio or its directors, officers or employees. However, if you submit Unsolicited Content to us, you agree that such Unsolicited Content will not be treated as confidential, regardless of what you otherwise state in your accompanying message. You further agree that such Unsolicited Content may be used and exploited by Rovio without compensation to you or any third party and you grant Rovio a perpetual, non-exclusive, irrevocable, fully paid, royalty free, sub-licensable and transferable (in whole or in part) worldwide license to use, exploit, reproduce, transmit, amend, display and exhibit Unsolicited Content in all current or future media for any purpose and to create derivative works based upon the Unsolicited Content.\n\nRovio assumes no responsibility for the conduct of other users of the Services and assumes no responsibility for monitoring the Services for inappropriate content or conduct. Rovio does not, and cannot, pre-screen or monitor all content or conduct of users. Your use of the Services is at your own risk.\nBy using the Services, you may be exposed to content or conduct that is offensive, indecent or otherwise not in line with your values. Rovio may utilize technology to monitor and/or record your interactions with the Services or communications (including, but not limited to, chat text) when you are using the Services. You irrevocably consent to such monitoring and recording. Accordingly, you agree that you have no expectation of privacy concerning the transmission of any content within the Services, including, but not limited to, chat text or voice communications.\nRovio reserves the right at its sole discretion to review, monitor, prohibit, edit, delete, disable access to or otherwise make unavailable any content made available by users of the Service without notice for any reason or for no reason at any time. If at any time Rovio chooses, at its sole discretion, to monitor the Services, Rovio nonetheless assumes no responsibility for content made available by users of the Services, and Rovio assumes no obligation to modify or remove any inappropriate content.\n\nIf you are a United States resident or otherwise make any claim against Rovio in the United States, you expressly agree that any legal claim, dispute or other controversy between you and Rovio arising out of or otherwise relating in any way to Services, including controversies relating to the applicability, enforceability or validity of any provision of these TOS or Rovio\u00b4s Privacy Policy (collectively \"Disputes\"), shall be resolved in confidential binding arbitration conducted before one commercial arbitrator from the American Arbitration Association (\"AAA\"), rather than in a court, as described herein. The arbitration will be governed by the AAA's commercial arbitration rules and, if the arbitrator deems them applicable, the supplementary procedures for consumer related disputes (collectively \"Rules and Procedures\"). You acknowledge that you are voluntarily and knowingly forfeiting your right to a trial by jury and to otherwise proceed in a lawsuit in state or federal court.\nPayment of arbitration costs will be governed by the AAA's fee schedule, unless you are able to show that your portion will be prohibitive as compared to litigation costs, in which case Rovio will pay as much of your arbitration costs as the arbitrator deems necessary to prevent the arbitration from being cost-prohibitive as compared to litigation costs. Rovio also reserves the right in its sole and exclusive discretion to assume responsibility for all arbitration costs imposed by the AAA. Each party agrees to pay its own attorneys' fees and expenses unless there is a governing statutory provision that requires the prevailing party to be paid attorneys' fees and expenses.\nThe arbitration may be conducted in Los Angeles, California or, upon your request, in the city closest to you location where AAA maintains an office. The arbitrator's award shall be final and binding on you and Rovio and may be entered as a judgment in any court of competent jurisdiction.\nFor more information on AAA, its Rules and Procedures, and how to file an arbitration claim, you may call AAA at 800-778-7879 or visit the AAA website at www.adr.org.\nAs an exception to the binding arbitration rule, to the extent the Dispute arises from:\n---A violation of Rovio\u00b4s intellectual property rights in any manner;\n---Any claim related to, or arising from, allegations of theft, piracy, unauthorized use or a violation of the United States Computer Fraud and Abuse Act or Section \u201cCode of conduct\u201d of these TOS; and\n---Any claim for equitable relief;\nthen both parties agree that a party may seek injunctive remedies (or an equivalent type of urgent legal relief) in any court with jurisdiction over the other party. In addition to the foregoing, either party may assert an individual action in small claims court for Claims that are within the scope of such court's jurisdiction in lieu of arbitration.\nTo the extent permissible under applicable law, all Disputes shall be resolved by binding confidential arbitration on an individual basis. You expressly agree that no other Disputes shall be consolidated or joined with your Dispute, whether through class arbitration proceedings or otherwise.\u00a0 You and Rovio agree that there is no right or authority for any dispute to be arbitrated on a class-action basis or to utilize class action procedures, there is no right or authority for any dispute to be brought in a purported representative capacity or as a private attorney general, and no arbitration shall be joined with any other arbitration.\nYou may opt out of this obligation to arbitrate. If you do so, neither you nor Rovio can require the other to participate in an arbitration proceeding. To opt out, you must notify Rovio in writing within 30 days of the date that you first became subject to this arbitration provision. You must use this address to opt out: Rovio Entertainment Corporation, ATTN: Legal Department, Keilaranta 7, 02150 Espoo, Finland. You must include your name and residence address and a clear statement that you want to opt out of this arbitration clause.\nTo begin an arbitration proceeding, you must send a letter to: Rovio Entertainment Corporation, ATTN: Legal Department, Keilaranta 7, 02150 Espoo, Finland requesting arbitration and describing your claim.\nRovio will provide 30-days\u2019 notice of any changes to this Section \u201cBinding arbitration/ Class waiver\u201d through the Services or via other similar means. Changes will become effective on the 30th day and will apply prospectively only to any claims arising after the 30th day.\n\nWithout limiting any other remedies available to Rovio, if Rovio believes that you are in breach of these TOS, Rovio reserves the right to take any of the following actions, whether individually or in combination, and either with or without notice to you: (i) delete, suspend and/or modify your Account or parts of your Account; (ii) limit, suspend and/or terminate your access to the Services; (iii) modify and/or remove any of your Virtual Items; (iv) reset and/or modify any game progression or benefits and privileges associated with you, such as any level or score you have reached in the Services.\n\nRovio may limit, suspend or terminate the Services, or portions thereof, and take technical and legal steps to prevent users from accessing the Services if Rovio believes they are creating risk or possible legal liabilities, infringing intellectual property rights of third parties, or not acting in accordance with the letter or spirit of these TOS.\nRovio reserves the right to stop offering and/or supporting the Services or a part thereof (e.g. a game or a feature of a game) at any time, at which point your license to use the Services or a part thereof will be terminated automatically. In such an event, unless otherwise required by applicable law, Rovio does not have to provide refunds for Virtual Items or other items in connection with such discontinued Services.\n\nTo the fullest extent permissible under applicable law, the Services are provided to you \u201cAS IS,\u201d without warranty, assurances or guarantees of any kind.

Moreover, you may have additional legal rights in your jurisdiction, and nothing in these TOS shall infringe upon the statutory rights that you may have as a consumer of the Services.\n\nIn no way will Rovio be liable for special, incidental or consequential damages resulting from access, use or malfunction of the Services, including but not limited to, damages to property, loss of goodwill, device failure or malfunction and, to the extent permitted by law, damages for personal injuries, property damage, lost profits or punitive damages from any causes of action arising out of or related to these TOS or the Services, whether arising in tort (including negligence), contract, strict liability or otherwise and whether or not Rovio has been advised of the possibility of such damages. For purposes of Article 12 \u201cLimitations of Liability,\u201d Rovio\u2019s licensors and other partners are third-party beneficiaries to the limitations of liability specified herein and may enforce these TOS against you.\nIn no way will Rovio\u00b4s total aggregate liability arising out of or in connection with these TOS, the Privacy Notice or the Services exceed the higher of: (i) the actual price (if any) you paid for the license to use Virtual Items; or (ii) one hundred euros (\u20ac100).

Release and Indemnification\nYou are fully responsible for your use of the service.\n\n\nR. Changes to these Terms of Service\nWe may modify this agreement, but we will give you 30 days&apos; notice of changes that affect your rights.\n\n\nS. Miscellaneous\nPlease see this section for legal details including our choice of law.\n\n\n\n\nEffective date: May 25, 2018\n\nShort version: We use these basic terms throughout the agreement, and they have specific meanings. You should know what we mean when we use each of the terms. There&apos;s not going to be a test on it, but it&apos;s still useful information.\n\n---The \u201cAgreement\u201d refers, collectively, to all the terms, conditions, notices contained or referenced in this document (the \u201cTerms of Service\u201d or the \"Terms\") and all other operating rules, policies (including the GitHub Privacy Statement, available at github.com/site/privacy) and procedures that we may publish from time to time on the Website. Most of our site policies are available at help.github.com/categories/site-policy.\n---The \u201cService\u201d refers to the applications, software, products, and services provided by GitHub.\n---The \u201cWebsite\u201d refers to GitHub\u2019s website located at github.com, and all content, services, and products provided by GitHub at or through the Website. It also refers to GitHub-owned subdomains of github.com, such as education.github.com and pages.github.com. These Terms also govern GitHub\u2019s conference websites, such as githubuniverse.com, and product websites, such as atom.io. Occasionally, websites owned by GitHub may provide different or additional terms of service. If those additional terms conflict with this Agreement, the more specific terms apply to the relevant page or service.\n---\u201cThe User,\u201d \u201cYou,\u201d and \u201cYour\u201d refer to the individual person, company, or organization that has visited or is using the Website or Service; that accesses or uses any part of the Account; or that directs the use of the Account in the performance of its functions. A User must be at least 13 years of age. Special terms may apply for business or government Accounts (See Section B(5): Additional Terms).\n---\u201cGitHub,\u201d \u201cWe,\u201d and \u201cUs\u201d refer to GitHub, Inc., as well as our affiliates, directors, subsidiaries, contractors, licensors, officers, agents, and employees.\n---\u201cContent\u201d refers to content featured or displayed through the Website, including without limitation text, data, articles, images, photographs, graphics, software, applications, designs, features, and other materials that are available on the Website or otherwise available through the Service. \"Content\" also includes Services. \u201cUser-Generated Content\u201d is Content, written or otherwise, created or uploaded by our Users. \"Your Content\" is Content that you create or own.\n---An \"Account\" represents your legal relationship with GitHub. A \u201cUser Account\u201d represents an individual User\u2019s authorization to log in to and use the Service and serves as a User\u2019s identity on GitHub. \u201cOrganizations\u201d are shared workspaces that may be associated with a single entity or with one or more Users where multiple Users can collaborate across many projects at once. A User Account can be a member of any number of Organizations.\n\n\nShort version: User Accounts and Organizations have different administrative controls; a human must create your Account; you must be 13 or over; you must provide a valid email address; and you may not have more than one free Account. You alone are responsible for your Account and anything that happens while you are signed in to or using your Account. You are responsible for keeping your Account secure.\n1. Account Controls\n\n---\nUsers. Subject to these Terms, you retain ultimate administrative control over your User Account and the Content within it.\n\n---\nOrganizations. The \"owner\" of an Organization that was created under these Terms has ultimate administrative control over that Organization and the Content within it. Within the Service, an owner can manage User access to the Organization\u2019s data and projects. An Organization may have multiple owners, but there must be at least one User Account designated as an owner of an Organization. If you are the owner of an Organization under these Terms, we consider you responsible for the actions that are performed on or through that Organization.\n\n\n2. Required Information\nYou must provide a valid email address in order to complete the signup process. Any other information requested, such as your real name, is optional, unless you are accepting these terms on behalf of a legal entity (in which case we need more information about the legal entity) or if you opt for a paid Account, in which case additional information will be necessary for billing purposes.\n3. Account Requirements\nWe have a few simple rules for User Accounts on GitHub&apos;s Service.\n\n---You must be a human to create an Account. Accounts registered by \"bots\" or other automated methods are not permitted. We do permit machine accounts:  \n---A machine account is an Account set up by an individual human who accepts the Terms on behalf of the Account, provides a valid email address, and is responsible for its actions. A machine account is used exclusively for performing automated tasks. Multiple users may direct the actions of a machine account, but the owner of the Account is ultimately responsible for the machine&apos;s actions. You may maintain no more than one free machine account in addition to your free User Account.\n---One person or legal entity may maintain no more than one free Account (if you choose to control a machine account as well, that&apos;s fine, but it can only be used for running a machine).\n---You must be age 13 or older. While we are thrilled to see brilliant young coders get excited by learning to program, we must comply with United States law. GitHub does not target our Service to children under 13, and we do not permit any Users under 13 on our Service. If we learn of any User under the age of 13, we will terminate that User\u2019s Account immediately. If you are a resident of a country outside the United States, your country\u2019s minimum age may be older; in such a case, you are responsible for complying with your country\u2019s laws.\n---Your login may only be used by one person \u2014 i.e., a single login may not be shared by multiple people. A paid Organization  may only provide access to as many User Accounts as your subscription allows.\n\n4. User Account Security\nYou are responsible for keeping your Account secure while you use our Service. We offer tools such as two-factor authentication to help you maintain your Account&apos;s security, but the content of your Account and its security are up to you.\n\n---You are responsible for all content posted and activity that occurs under your Account (even when content is posted by others who have Accounts under your Account).\n---You are responsible for maintaining the security of your Account and password. GitHub cannot and will not be liable for any loss or damage from your failure to comply with this security obligation.\n---You will promptly notify GitHub if you become aware of any unauthorized use of, or access to, our Service through your Account, including any unauthorized use of your password or Account.\n\n5. Additional Terms\nIn some situations, third parties&apos; terms may apply to your use of GitHub. For example, you may be a member of an organization on GitHub with its own terms or license agreements; you may download an application that integrates with GitHub; or you may use GitHub to authenticate to another service. Please be aware that while these Terms are our full agreement with you, other parties&apos; terms govern their relationships with you.\nIf you are a government User or otherwise accessing or using any GitHub Service in a government capacity, this Government Amendment to GitHub Terms of Service applies to you, and you agree to its provisions.\nIf you have signed up for GitHub Enterprise Cloud, the Enterprise Cloud Addendum applies to you, and you agree to its provisions.\n\nShort version: GitHub hosts a wide variety of collaborative projects from all over the world, and that collaboration only works when our users are able to work together in good faith. While using the service, you must follow this Acceptable Use Policy, which includes some restrictions on content you can post, conduct on the service, and other limitations. In short, be excellent to each other.\n1. Compliance with Laws and Regulations\nYour use of the Website and Service must not violate any applicable laws, including copyright or trademark laws, export control laws, or other laws in your jurisdiction. You are responsible for making sure that your use of the Service is in compliance with laws and any applicable regulations.\n2. Content Restrictions\nYou agree that you will not under any circumstances upload, post, host, or transmit any content that:\n\n---is unlawful or promotes unlawful activities;\n---is or contains sexually obscene content;\n---is libelous, defamatory, or fraudulent;\n---is discriminatory or abusive toward any individual or group;\n---contains or installs any active malware or exploits, or uses our platform for exploit delivery (such as part of a command and control system); or\n---infringes on any proprietary right of any party, including patent, trademark, trade secret, copyright, right of publicity, or other rights.\n\n3. Conduct Restrictions\nWhile using GitHub, you agree that you will not under any circumstances:\n\n---harass, abuse, threaten, or incite violence towards any individual or group, including GitHub employees, officers, and agents, or other GitHub Users;\n---use our servers for any form of excessive automated bulk activity (for example, spamming), or relay any other form of unsolicited advertising or solicitation through our servers, such as get-rich-quick schemes;\n---attempt to disrupt or tamper with GitHub&apos;s servers in ways that could harm our Website or Service, to place undue burden on GitHub&apos;s servers through automated means, or to access GitHub&apos;s Service in ways that exceed your authorization (other than those authorized by the GitHub Bug Bounty program);\n---impersonate any person or entity, including any of our employees or representatives, including through false association with GitHub, or by fraudulently misrepresenting your identity or site&apos;s purpose; or\n---violate the privacy of any third party, such as by posting another person&apos;s personal information without consent.\n\n4. Services Usage Limits\nYou agree not to reproduce, duplicate, copy, sell, resell or exploit any portion of the Service, use of the Service, or access to the Service without GitHub&apos;s express written permission.\n5. Scraping\nScraping refers to extracting data from our Website via an automated process, such as a bot or webcrawler. It does not refer to the collection of information through GitHub&apos;s API. Please see Section H for our API Terms. You may scrape the website for the following reasons:\n\n---Researchers may scrape public, non-personal information from GitHub for research purposes, only if any publications resulting from that research are open access.\n---Archivists may scrape GitHub for public data for archival purposes.\n\nYou may not scrape GitHub for spamming purposes, including for the purposes of selling GitHub users&apos; personal information, such as to recruiters, headhunters, and job boards.\nAll use of GitHub data gathered through scraping must comply with the GitHub Privacy Statement.\n6. Privacy\nMisuse of GitHub Users&apos; Personal Information is prohibited.\nAny person, entity, or service collecting data from GitHub must comply with the GitHub Privacy Statement, particularly in regards to the collection of our Users&apos; Personal Information (as defined in the GitHub Privacy Statement). If you collect any GitHub User&apos;s Personal Information from GitHub, you agree that you will only use the Personal Information you gather for the purpose for which our User has authorized it. You agree that you will reasonably secure any Personal Information you have gathered from GitHub, and you will respond promptly to complaints, removal requests, and \"do not contact\" requests from GitHub or GitHub Users.\n7. Excessive Bandwidth Use\nIf we determine your bandwidth usage to be significantly excessive in relation to other GitHub customers, we reserve the right to suspend your Account or throttle your file hosting until you can reduce your bandwidth consumption.\n8. User Protection\nYou agree not to engage in activity that significantly harms our Users. We will resolve disputes in favor of protecting our Users as a whole.\n\nShort version: You own content you create, but you allow us certain rights to it, so that we can display and share the content you post. You still have control over your content, and responsibility for it, and the rights you grant us are limited to those we need to provide the service. We have the right to remove content or close Accounts if we need to.\n1. Responsibility for User-Generated Content\nYou may create or upload User-Generated Content while using the Service. You are solely responsible for the content of, and for any harm resulting from, any User-Generated Content that you post, upload, link to or otherwise make available via the Service, regardless of the form of that Content. We are not responsible for any public display or misuse of your User-Generated Content.\n2. GitHub May Remove Content\nWe do not pre-screen User-Generated Content, but we have the right (though not the obligation) to refuse or remove any User-Generated Content that, in our sole discretion, violates any GitHub terms or policies.\n3. Ownership of Content, Right to Post, and License Grants\nYou retain ownership of and responsibility for Your Content. If you&apos;re posting anything you did not create yourself or do not own the rights to, you agree that you are responsible for any Content you post; that you will only submit Content that you have the right to post; and that you will fully comply with any third party licenses relating to Content you post.\nBecause you retain ownership of and responsibility for Your Content, we need you to grant us \u2014 and other GitHub Users \u2014 certain legal permissions, listed in Sections D.4 \u2014 D.7. These license grants apply to Your Content. If you upload Content that already comes with a license granting GitHub the permissions we need to run our Service, no additional license is required. You understand that you will not receive any payment for any of the rights granted in Sections D.4 \u2014 D.7. The licenses you grant to us will end when you remove Your Content from our servers, unless other Users have forked it.\n4. License Grant to Us\nWe need the legal right to do things like host Your Content, publish it, and share it. You grant us and our legal successors the right to store, parse, and display Your Content, and make incidental copies as necessary to render the Website and provide the Service. This includes the right to do things like copy it to our database and make backups; show it to you and other users; parse it into a search index or otherwise analyze it on our servers; share it with other users; and perform it, in case Your Content is something like music or video.\nThis license does not grant GitHub the right to sell Your Content or otherwise distribute or use it outside of our provision of the Service.\n5. License Grant to Other Users\nAny User-Generated Content you post publicly, including issues, comments, and contributions to other Users&apos; repositories, may be viewed by others. By setting your repositories to be viewed publicly, you agree to allow others to view and \"fork\" your repositories (this means that others may make their own copies of Content from your repositories in repositories they control).\nIf you set your pages and repositories to be viewed publicly, you grant each User of GitHub a nonexclusive, worldwide license to use, display, and perform Your Content through the GitHub Service and to reproduce Your Content solely on GitHub as permitted through GitHub&apos;s functionality (for example, through forking). You may grant further rights if you adopt a license. If you are uploading Content you did not create or own, you are responsible for ensuring that the Content you upload is licensed under terms that grant these permissions to other GitHub Users.\n6. Contributions Under Repository License\nWhenever you make a contribution to a repository containing notice of a license, you license your contribution under the same terms, and you agree that you have the right to license your contribution under those terms. If you have a separate agreement to license your contributions under different terms, such as a contributor license agreement, that agreement will supersede.\nIsn&apos;t this just how it works already? Yep. This is widely accepted as the norm in the open-source community; it&apos;s commonly referred to by the shorthand \"inbound=outbound\". We&apos;re just making it explicit.\n7. Moral Rights\nYou retain all moral rights to Your Content that you upload, publish, or submit to any part of the Service, including the rights of integrity and attribution. However, you waive these rights and agree not to assert them against us, to enable us to reasonably exercise the rights granted in Section D.4, but not otherwise.\nTo the extent this agreement is not enforceable by applicable law, you grant GitHub the rights we need to use Your Content without attribution and to make reasonable adaptations of Your Content as necessary to render the Website and provide the Service.\n\nShort version: You may have access to private repositories. We treat the content of private repositories as confidential, and we only access it for support reasons, with your consent, or if required to for security reasons.\n1. Control of Private Repositories.\nSome Accounts, such as paid Accounts, may have private repositories, which allow the User to control access to Content.\n2. Confidentiality of Private Repositories.\nGitHub considers the contents of private repositories to be confidential to you. GitHub will protect the contents of private repositories from unauthorized use, access, or disclosure in the same manner that we would use to protect our own confidential information of a similar nature and in no event with less than a reasonable degree of care.\n3. Access.\nGitHub employees may only access the content of your private repositories in the following situations:\n\n---With your consent and knowledge, for support reasons. If GitHub accesses a private repository for support reasons, we will only do so with the owner\u2019s consent and knowledge.\n---When access is required for security reasons, including when access is required to maintain ongoing confidentiality, integrity, availability and resilience of GitHub&apos;s systems and Service.\n\nYou may choose to enable additional access to your private repositories. For example:\n\n---You may enable various GitHub services or features that require additional rights to Your Content in private repositories. These rights may vary depending on the service or feature, but GitHub will continue to treat your private repository Content as confidential. If those services or features require rights in addition to those we need to provide the GitHub Service, we will provide an explanation of those rights.\n\n4. Exclusions.\nIf we have reason to believe the contents of a private repository are in violation of the law or of these Terms, we have the right to access, review, and remove them. Additionally, we may be compelled by law to disclose the contents of your private repositories.\n\nIf you believe that content on our website violates your copyright, please contact us in accordance with our Digital Millennium Copyright Act Policy. If you are a copyright owner and you believe that content on GitHub violates your rights, please contact us via our convenient DMCA form or by emailing copyright@github.com. There may be legal consequences for sending a false or frivolous takedown notice. Before sending a takedown request, you must consider legal uses such as fair use and licensed uses.\nWe will terminate the Accounts of repeat infringers of this policy.\n\nShort version: We own the service and all of our content. In order for you to use our content, we give you certain rights to it, but you may only use our content in the way we have allowed.\n1. GitHub&apos;s Rights to Content\nGitHub and our licensors, vendors, agents, and/or our content providers retain ownership of all intellectual property rights of any kind related to the Website and Service. We reserve all rights that are not expressly granted to you under this Agreement or by law. The look and feel of the Website and Service is copyright \u00a9 GitHub, Inc. All rights reserved. You may not duplicate, copy, or reuse any portion of the HTML/CSS, Javascript, or visual design elements or concepts without express written permission from GitHub.\n2. GitHub Trademarks and Logos\nIf you\u2019d like to use GitHub\u2019s trademarks, you must follow all of our trademark guidelines, including those on our logos page: https://github.com/logos.\n3. License to GitHub Policies\nThis Agreement is licensed under this Creative Commons Zero license. For details, see our site-policy repository.\n\nShort version: You agree to these Terms of Service, plus this Section H, when using any of GitHub&apos;s APIs (Application Provider Interface), including use of the API through a third party product that accesses GitHub.\nNo Abuse or Overuse of the API\nAbuse or excessively frequent requests to GitHub via the API may result in the temporary or permanent suspension of your Account&apos;s access to the API. GitHub, in our sole discretion, will determine abuse or excessive usage of the API. We will make a reasonable attempt to warn you via email prior to suspension.\nYou may not share API tokens to exceed GitHub&apos;s rate limitations.\nYou may not use the API to download data or Content from GitHub for spamming purposes, including for the purposes of selling GitHub users&apos; personal information, such as to recruiters, headhunters, and job boards.\nAll use of the GitHub API is subject to these Terms of Service and the GitHub Privacy Statement.\nGitHub may offer subscription-based access to our API for those Users who require high-throughput access or access that would result in resale of GitHub&apos;s Service.\n\nShort version: The GitHub Pages hosting service is subject to certain rules, in addition to the rest of the Terms.\nEach GitHub Account comes with access to the GitHub Pages static hosting service. This hosting service is intended to host static web pages for GitHub users. GitHub Pages are subject to some specific bandwidth and usage limits, and may not be appropriate for some high-bandwidth uses or other prohibited uses. Please see our GitHub Pages guidelines for more information.\nGitHub reserves the right at all times to reclaim any GitHub subdomain without liability.\n\nShort version: You need to follow certain rules if you create an application for other Users, and there are additional Terms that cover the Marketplace.\n1. Creating Applications\nIf you create a third-party application or other developer product that collects User Personal Information or User-Generated Content and integrates with the Service through GitHub&apos;s API, OAuth mechanism, or otherwise (\"Developer Product\"), and make it available for other Users, then you must comply with the following requirements:\n\n---You must comply with this Agreement and the GitHub Privacy Statement.\n---Except as otherwise permitted, such as by law or by a license, you must limit your usage of the User Personal Information or User-Generated Content you collect to that purpose for which the User has authorized its collection. \n---You must take all reasonable security measures appropriate to the risks, such as against accidental or unlawful destruction, or accidental loss, alteration, unauthorized disclosure or access, presented by processing the User Personal Information or User-Generated Content.\n---You must not hold yourself out as collecting any User Personal Information or User-Generated Content on GitHub\u2019s behalf, and provide sufficient notice of your privacy practices to the User, such as by posting a privacy policy.\n---You must provide Users with a method of deleting any User Personal Information or User-Generated Content you have collected through GitHub after it is no longer needed for the limited and specified purposes for which the User authorized its collection, except where retention is required by law or otherwise permitted, such as through a license.\n\nIf you list a Developer Product through GitHub Marketplace, then you must agree to the GitHub Marketplace Developer Agreement, prior to submitting the project to be listed. \n2. Using Third-Party Applications\nYou may grant a Developer Product authorization to use, access, and disclose the contents of your repositories, including your private repositories. Some Developer Products are available through GitHub Marketplace. Some Developer Products can be used for performing automated tasks, and often times multiple Users may direct the actions of a Developer Product. However, if you purchase and/or set up a Developer Product on your Account, or you are an owner of an Account with an integrated Developer Product, then you will be responsible for the Developer Product&apos;s actions that are performed on or through your Account. Please see our Privacy Statement for more information about how we share data with Developer Products. \nGitHub makes no warranties of any kind in relation to Developer Products and is not liable for disclosures to third parties that you authorize to access Your Content. Your use of any third-party applications is at your sole risk.\nIf you buy Developer Products through GitHub Marketplace, the GitHub Marketplace Terms of Service controls your purchase. This Agreement, as well as the GitHub Marketplace Terms of Service, will govern your use of GitHub Marketplace. \n\nShort version: We do not generally prohibit use of GitHub for advertising. However, we expect our users to follow certain limitations, so GitHub does not become a spam haven. No one wants that.\n1. GitHub Pages\nWe offer Pages sites primarily as a showcase for personal and organizational projects. Some monetization efforts are permitted on Pages, such as donation buttons and crowdfunding links.\n2. GitHub Repositories\nGitHub repositories are intended to host Content. You may include static images, links, and promotional text in the README documents associated with your repositories, but they must be related to the project you are hosting on GitHub.\nYou may not advertise in other Users&apos; repositories, such as by posting monetized or excessive bulk content in issues.\n3. Spamming and Inappropriate Use of GitHub\nAdvertising Content, like all Content, must not violate the law or these Terms of Use, for example through excessive bulk activity such as spamming. We reserve the right to remove any advertisements that, in our sole discretion, violate any GitHub terms or policies.\n\nShort version: You are responsible for any fees associated with your use of GitHub. We are responsible for communicating those fees to you clearly and accurately, and letting you know well in advance if those prices change.\n1. Pricing\nOur pricing and payment terms are available at github.com/pricing. If you agree to a subscription price, that will remain your price for the duration of the payment term; however, prices are subject to change at the end of a payment term.\n2. Upgrades, Downgrades, and Changes\n\n---We will immediately bill you when you upgrade from the free plan to any paying plan.\n---If you change from a monthly billing plan to a yearly billing plan, GitHub will bill you for a full year at the next monthly billing date.\n---If you upgrade to a higher level of service, we will bill you for the upgraded plan immediately.\n---You may change your level of service at any time by choosing a plan option or going into your Billing settings. If you choose to downgrade your Account, you may lose access to Content, features, or capacity of your Account. Please see our section on Cancellation for information on getting a copy of that Content.\n\n3. Billing Schedule; No Refunds\n\n---For monthly or yearly payment plans, the Service is billed in advance on a monthly or yearly basis respectively and is non-refundable. There will be no refunds or credits for partial months of service, downgrade refunds, or refunds for months unused with an open Account; however, the service will remain active for the length of the paid billing period.\n---In order to treat everyone equally, no exceptions will be made.\n\n4. Authorization\nBy agreeing to these Terms, you are giving us permission to charge your on-file credit card, PayPal account, or other approved methods of payment for fees that you authorize for GitHub.\n5. Responsibility for Payment\nYou are responsible for all fees, including taxes, associated with your use of the Service. By using the Service, you agree to pay GitHub any charge incurred in connection with your use of the Service.  If you dispute the matter, contact GitHub Support. You are responsible for providing us with a valid means of payment for paid Accounts. Free Accounts are not required to provide payment information.\n\nShort version: You may close your Account at any time. If you do, we&apos;ll treat your information responsibly.\n1. Account Cancellation\nIt is your responsibility to properly cancel your Account with GitHub. You can cancel your Account at any time by going into your Settings in the global navigation bar at the top of the screen. The Account screen provides a simple, no questions asked cancellation link. We are not able to cancel Accounts in response to an email or phone request.\n2. Upon Cancellation\nWe will retain and use your information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements, but barring legal requirements, we will delete your full profile and the Content of your repositories within 90 days of cancellation or termination (though some information may remain in encrypted backups). This information can not be recovered once your Account is cancelled.\nWe will not delete Content that you have contributed to other Users&apos; repositories or that other Users have forked.\nUpon request, we will make a reasonable effort to provide an Account owner with a copy of your lawful, non-infringing Account contents after Account cancellation, termination, or downgrade. You must make this request within 90 days of cancellation, termination, or downgrade.\n3. GitHub May Terminate\nGitHub has the right to suspend or terminate your access to all or any part of the Website at any time, with or without cause, with or without notice, effective immediately. GitHub reserves the right to refuse service to anyone for any reason at any time.\n4. Survival\nAll provisions of this Agreement which by their nature should survive termination will survive termination, including, without limitation, ownership provisions, warranty disclaimers, indemnity, and limitations of liability.\n\nShort version: We use email and other electronic means to stay in touch with our users.\n1. Electronic Communication Required\nFor contractual purposes, you (1) consent to receive communications from us in an electronic form via the email address you have submitted or via the Service; and (2) agree that all Terms of Service, agreements, notices, disclosures, and other communications that we provide to you electronically satisfy any legal requirement that those communications would satisfy if they were on paper. This section does not affect your non-waivable rights.\n2. Legal Notice to GitHub Must Be in Writing\nCommunications made through email or GitHub Support&apos;s messaging system will not constitute legal notice to GitHub or any of its officers, employees, agents or representatives in any situation where notice to GitHub is required by contract or any law or regulation. Legal notice to GitHub must be in writing and served on GitHub&apos;s legal agent.\n3. No Phone Support\nGitHub only offers support via email, in-Service communications, and electronic messages. We do not offer telephone support.\n\nShort version: We provide our service as is, and we make no promises or guarantees about this service. Please read this section carefully; you should understand what to expect.\nGitHub provides the Website and the Service \u201cas is\u201d and \u201cas available,\u201d without warranty of any kind. Without limiting this, we expressly disclaim all warranties, whether express, implied or statutory, regarding the Website and the Service including without limitation any warranty of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, title, security, accuracy and non-infringement.\nGitHub does not warrant that the Service will meet your requirements; that the Service will be uninterrupted, timely, secure, or error-free; that the information provided through the Service is accurate, reliable or correct; that any defects or errors will be corrected; that the Service will be available at any particular time or location; or that the Service is free of viruses or other harmful components. You assume full responsibility and risk of loss resulting from your downloading and/or use of files, information, content or other material obtained from the Service.\n\nShort version: We will not be liable for damages or losses arising from your use or inability to use the service or otherwise arising under this agreement. Please read this section carefully; it limits our obligations to you.\nYou understand and agree that we will not be liable to you or any third party for any loss of profits, use, goodwill, or data, or for any incidental, indirect, special, consequential or exemplary damages, however arising, that result from\n\n---the use, disclosure, or display of your User-Generated Content;\n---your use or inability to use the Service;\n---any modification, price change, suspension or discontinuance of the Service;\n---the Service generally or the software or systems that make the Service available;\n---unauthorized access to or alterations of your transmissions or data;\n---statements or conduct of any third party on the Service;\n---any other user interactions that you input or receive through your use of the Service; or\n---any other matter relating to the Service.\n\nOur liability is limited whether or not we have been informed of the possibility of such damages, and even if a remedy set forth in this Agreement is found to have failed of its essential purpose. We will have no liability for any failure or delay due to matters beyond our reasonable control.\n\nShort version: You are responsible for your use of the service.

These section titles and brief summaries are not legally binding.\n4. Severability, No Waiver, and Survival\nIf any part of this Agreement is held invalid or unenforceable, that portion of the Agreement will be construed to reflect the parties\u2019 original intent. The remaining portions will remain in full force and effect. Any failure on the part of GitHub to enforce any provision of this Agreement will not be considered a waiver of our right to enforce such provision.

Amendments; Complete Agreement\nThis Agreement may only be modified by a written amendment signed by an authorized representative of GitHub, or by the posting by GitHub of a revised version in accordance with Section R. Changes to These Terms. These Terms of Service, together with the GitHub Privacy Statement, represent the complete and exclusive statement of the agreement between you and us.

While Instagram prohibits such conduct and content on its site, you understand and agree that Instagram cannot be responsible for the Content posted on its web site and you nonetheless may be exposed to such materials and that you use the Instagram service at your own risk.\n\n\n\n---We reserve the right to modify or terminate the Instagram service for any reason, without notice at any time.\n---We reserve the right to alter these Terms of Use at any time. If the alterations constitute a material change to the Terms of Use, we will notify you via internet mail according to the preference expressed on your account. What constitutes a \"material change\" will be determined at our sole discretion, in good faith and using common sense and reasonable judgement.\n---We reserve the right to refuse service to anyone for any reason at any time.\n---We reserve the right to force forfeiture of any username that becomes inactive, violates trademark, or may mislead other users.\n---We may, but have no obligation to, remove Content and accounts containing Content that we determine in our sole discretion are unlawful, offensive, threatening, libelous, defamatory, obscene or otherwise objectionable or violates any party's intellectual property or these Terms of Use.\n---We reserve the right to reclaim usernames on behalf of businesses or individuals that hold legal claim or trademark on those usernames.\n\n\n\n---Instagram does NOT claim ANY ownership rights in the text, files, images, photos, video, sounds, musical works, works of authorship, applications, or any other materials (collectively, \"Content\") that you post on or through the Instagram Services. By displaying or publishing (\"posting\") any Content on or through the Instagram Services, you hereby grant to Instagram a non-exclusive, fully paid and royalty-free, worldwide, limited license to use, modify, delete from, add to, publicly perform, publicly display, reproduce and translate such Content, including without limitation distributing part or all of the Site in any media formats through any media channels, except Content not shared publicly (\"private\") will not be distributed outside the Instagram Services.\n---Some of the Instagram Services are supported by advertising revenue and may display advertisements and promotions, and you hereby agree that Instagram may place such advertising and promotions on the Instagram Services or on, about, or in conjunction with your Content. The manner, mode and extent of such advertising and promotions are subject to change without specific notice to you.\n---You represent and warrant that: (i) you own the Content posted by you on or through the Instagram Services or otherwise have the right to grant the license set forth in this section, (ii) the posting and use of your Content on or through the Instagram Services does not violate the privacy rights, publicity rights, copyrights, contract rights, intellectual property rights or any other rights of any person, and (iii) the posting of your Content on the Site does not result in a breach of contract between you and a third party. You agree to pay for all royalties, fees, and any other monies owing any person by reason of Content you post on or through the Instagram Services.\n---The Instagram Services contain Content of Instagram (\"Instagram Content\"). Instagram Content is protected by copyright, trademark, patent, trade secret and other laws, and Instagram owns and retains all rights in the Instagram Content and the Instagram Services. Instagram hereby grants you a limited, revocable, nonsublicensable license to reproduce and display the Instagram Content (excluding any software code) solely for your personal use in connection with viewing the Site and using the Instagram Services.\n---The Instagram Services contain Content of Users and other Instagram licensors. Except as provided within this Agreement, you may not copy, modify, translate, publish, broadcast, transmit, distribute, perform, display, or sell any Content appearing on or through the Instagram Services.\n---Instagram performs technical functions necessary to offer the Instagram Services, including but not limited to transcoding and/or reformatting Content to allow its use throughout the Instagram Services.\n---Although the Site and other Instagram Services are normally available, there will be occasions when the Site or other Instagram Services will be interrupted for scheduled maintenance or upgrades, for emergency repairs, or due to failure of telecommunications links and equipment that are beyond the control of Instagram. Also, although Instagram will normally only delete Content that violates this Agreement, Instagram reserves the right to delete any Content for any reason, without prior notice. Deleted content may be stored by Instagram in order to comply with certain legal obligations and is not retrievable without a valid court order. Consequently, Instagram encourages you to maintain your own backup of your Content. In other words, Instagram is not a backup service. Instagram will not be liable to you for any modification, suspension, or discontinuation of the Instagram Services, or the loss of any Content.\n\n\n \n \n \n\n\n\n\n---About us\n---Support\n---Press\n---API\n---Jobs\n---Privacy\n---\n                                      \n                                          Terms\n                                      \n                                    \n\n\n\u00a9 2019 Instagram\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n"}, "reddit": {"https://www.redditinc.com/policies/user-agreement": "\n\n\n\n\n\nUser Agreement - September 24, 2018 - Reddit\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmenu\n\n\n---About\n---Careers\n---Press\n---Advertising\n---Partnerships\n---Blog\n\n\n\n---Reddit Mobile App\n---Reddit.com\n---Reddit Gifts\n---Reddit Coins\n---Reddit Premium\n\n\n\nUser Agreement\nPrivacy Policy\nContent Policy\nModerator Guidelines\n\n\u00a9 2019 reddit inc.

This Reddit User Agreement (\"Terms\") applies to your access to and use of the websites, mobile apps, widgets, and other online products and services (collectively, the \"Services\") provided by Reddit, Inc. (\"Reddit,\" \"we,\" or \"us\"). \nRemember Reddit is for fun and is intended to be a place for your entertainment, but we still need some basic rules. By accessing or using our Services, you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you do not agree to these Terms, you may not access or use our Services. \nPlease take a look at Reddit\u2019s Privacy Policy too\u2014it explains how we collect, use, and share information about you when you access or use our Services.\n\n\n\n1.  Your Access to the Services\n\nChildren under the age of 13 are not allowed to create an account or otherwise use the Services. Additionally, if you are in the European Economic Area, you must be over the age required by the laws of your country to create an account or otherwise use the Services, or we need to have received verifiable consent from your parent or legal guardian.\nIn addition, certain of our Services or portions of our Services require you to be older than 13 years of age, so please read all notices and any Additional Terms carefully when you access the Services. \nIf you are accepting these Terms on behalf of another legal entity, including a business or a government, you represent that you have full legal authority to bind such entity to these terms.\n\n \n2.  Your Use of the Services\n\nReddit grants you a personal, non-transferable, non-exclusive, revocable, limited license to use and access the Services solely as permitted by these Terms. We reserve all rights not expressly granted to you by these Terms.\nExcept as permitted through the Services or as otherwise permitted by us in writing, your license does not include the right to:\n---license, sell, transfer, assign, distribute, host, or otherwise commercially exploit the Services or Content; ---modify, prepare derivative works of, disassemble, decompile, or reverse engineer any part of the Services or Content; or---access the Services or Content in order to build a similar or competitive website, product, or service, except as permitted under the Reddit API Terms of Use.We reserve the right to modify, suspend, or discontinue the Services (in whole or in part) at any time, with or without notice to you.

You agree that we will not be liable to you or to any third party for any modification, suspension, or discontinuation of the Services or any part thereof.\n\n \n3.  Your Reddit Account and Account Security\n\nTo use certain features of our Services, you may be required to create a Reddit account (an \"Account\") and provide us with a username, password, and certain other information about yourself as set forth in the Privacy Policy. \nYou are solely responsible for the information associated with Your Account and anything that happens related to Your Account.

We take no responsibility for and we do not expressly or implicitly endorse any of Your Content.\nBy submitting Your Content to the Services, you represent and warrant that you have all rights, power, and authority necessary to grant the rights to Your Content contained within these Terms. Because you alone are responsible for Your Content, you may expose yourself to liability if you post or share Content without all necessary rights.\nYou retain any ownership rights you have in Your Content, but you grant Reddit the following license to use that Content:\nWhen Your Content is created with or submitted to the Services, you grant us a worldwide, royalty-free, perpetual, irrevocable, non-exclusive, transferable, and sublicensable license to use, copy, modify, adapt, prepare derivative works from, distribute, perform, and display Your Content and any name, username, voice, or likeness provided in connection with Your Content in all media formats and channels now known or later developed.

However, we conditionally grant permission to crawl the Services for the sole purpose of and solely to the extent necessary for creating publicly available searchable indices of the materials subject to the parameters set forth in our robots.txt file.\n\n \n7.  Moderators\n\nModerating a subreddit is an unofficial, voluntary position that may be available to users of the Services. We are not responsible for actions taken by the moderators. We recognize that moderation can take some work, so we may change the features or abilities associated with moderating from time to time without prior notice. We reserve the right to revoke or limit a user\u2019s ability to moderate at any time and for any reason or no reason, including for a breach of these Terms.\nIf you choose to moderate a subreddit:\n---You agree to follow the Moderator Guidelines for Healthy Communities;---You agree that when you receive reports related to your community, that you will take action to moderate by removing content and/or escalating to the admins for review;---You may not represent that you are authorized to act on behalf of Reddit, Inc.;---You may not enter into any agreement with a third party on behalf of Reddit, or any subreddits that you moderate, without our written approval;---You may not perform moderation actions in return for any form of compensation or favor from third parties;---If you have access to non-public information as a result of moderating a subreddit, you will use such information only in connection with your performance as a moderator; and---You may create and enforce rules for the subreddits you moderate, provided that such rules do not conflict with these Terms, our Content Policy, and the Moderator Guidelines for Healthy Communities.Reddit reserves the right, but has no obligation, to overturn any action or decision of a moderator if Reddit believes that such action or decision is not in the interest of Reddit or the Reddit community.\n\n \n8.  Copyright, the DMCA & Takedowns\n\nReddit respects the intellectual property of others and requires that users of our Services do the same. We have a policy that includes the removal of any infringing materials from the Services and for the termination, in appropriate circumstances, of users of our Services who are repeat infringers.

If you believe Your Content was wrongly removed due to a mistake or misidentification, you can send a counter notification to our Copyright Agent (contact information provided above). Please see 17 U.S.C. \u00a7512(g)(3) for the requirements of a proper counter notification. \n\n \n9.  Reddit Premium, Virtual Goods and Payment Information\n\nThere are no fees for use of many aspects of the Services. However, premium features, including Reddit Premium and Virtual Goods, which include Coins, may be available for purchase on certain of our Services. In addition to these terms, by purchasing or using Reddit Premium or our Virtual Goods, you further agree to the Reddit Premium and Virtual Goods Agreement.\nReddit may change the fees or benefits associated with the premium features from time to time with reasonable advance notice; provided, however, that no advance notice will be required for temporary promotions, including temporary reductions in the fees associated with the premium features.\nYou may submit your debit card, credit card, or other payment information (\"Payment Information\") via our Services to purchase premium features or other paid products or services.

We reserve the right to control the defense of any matter for which you are required to indemnify us, and you agree to cooperate with our defense of these claims.\n\n \n11.
