This Vimeo Terms of Service Agreement is made between Vimeo, Inc. and you, our customer.

Purchases of Vimeo On Demand videos are governed by our Vimeo On Demand Viewer Agreement.

Purchases of Vimeo Stock footage and licenses are governed by our Vimeo Stock License Agreement.

The license period begins when you submit the video to Vimeo and ends when you or Vimeo delete it; provided that Vimeo may retain archival copies: for a limited period of time in case you wish to restore it; when the video is the subject of a takedown notice or other legal claim; or when Vimeo in good faith believes that it is legally obligated to do so.

With respect to Basic memberships, Vimeo may terminate this Agreement at any time by providing thirty days' written notice, and users may terminate at any time by deleting their accounts.

You may not assign this Agreement to any person whose account has been terminated by Vimeo or who is prohibited from registering; any such assignment will be void.

If you have a signed agreement with Vimeo, any conflicting term of that agreement will prevail over the terms hereof, but only as to the subject matter of that agreement.
