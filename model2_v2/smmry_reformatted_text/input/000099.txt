Your videos may be viewed and otherwise accessed by others, and associated metadata (e.g., titles, descriptions, tags, etc.)
are viewable by others.
Your interactions with other users (e.g., comments, "likes," private messages) may be seen by others.

We may obtain data from third parties about you.
We may combine that data with information that we have collected.
For example, some advertisers or advertising platforms may allow us to determine what other online services you might use so that we may place relevant ads on those services.
<PARAGRAPH>
We may use your data for the following purposes:
---Identification and authentication:
We use your data to verify you when you access your account.
<PARAGRAPH>

<PARAGRAPH>
---Improving our services: We use your data to understand how our services are being used and how we can improve them.
In general, we analyze aggregated data, rather than specific user data.
We may, however, need to analyze a specific case to address a specific problem (e.g., a bug that affects only a few accounts).
<PARAGRAPH>
---Customizing your experience: We use your data to personalize the service to you.
This may include remembering your preferences for language or volume or displaying videos that you might enjoy, based upon your viewing choices.
<PARAGRAPH>

We may also use your data in delivering third-party advertisements to you.
This may include "targeted ads" based upon your activities.

<PARAGRAPH>

("requests") that we receive from government authorities or parties to legal proceedings.
We direct law enforcement agencies to our Law Enforcement Guidelines page.
<PARAGRAPH>
We handle U.S. requests in accordance with U.S. law.
If the request originates from a foreign jurisdiction, we will typically disclose information where we in good faith believe that disclosure is permitted by both U.S. law and local law.
In all cases, we may raise or waive any legal objection or right available to us, in our sole discretion.
<PARAGRAPH>
We may disclose user data where we reasonably believe that someone's life is at risk.
For example, if we become aware of a person threatening to commit suicide, we may share that person's data with appropriate entities that may have the ability to help.
<PARAGRAPH>
We may disclose user data to report suspected crimes.
We report content suspected of exploiting minors to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children (NCMEC) along with the data identifying the uploading user.
<PARAGRAPH>

If you challenge such a notice, we may share your response with the complainant.
<PARAGRAPH>
We may share your data with potential transaction partners, advisors, and others in the event our company is, in whole or part, acquired by a third party.
In such case, we will use reasonable efforts to require the acquiring entity to comply with this Privacy Policy.
<PARAGRAPH>
We retain your data for as long as you have an account.
When you close an account, we will delete its content, including its videos.
We may retain logs of automatically collected information (for internal analytics); your email address; your tax information; communications with you; and your transactional information (for auditing, tax, and financial purposes).
When we no longer have a business reason for retaining data, we will delete or anonymize it.
<PARAGRAPH>
We retain deleted videos on our servers for a short period in case you wish to reverse deletion.
Once we delete a video, we may not be able to recover it.
If you have previously made a video public, the video or its thumbnail may be discoverable in a search engine's cache for a time.
We have no control over search engines; however, we will, upon request, send a request for deletion to major search engines.
<PARAGRAPH>
If we receive legal process pertaining to your account, we will retain your data for as long as we in good faith believe is necessary to comply with the legal process.
Similarly, if we believe that your account has been involved in wrongdoing, we may preserve your data to defend or assert our rights.
<PARAGRAPH>
We enable you to make numerous choices about your data:
---You may choose not to provide us with certain information.
For example, you may choose not to create an account or not to provide optional account information.
<PARAGRAPH>

<PARAGRAPH>
Our video hosting and sharing tools offer the ability to limit the distribution of your content, including your videos.
This section explains some of your choices.
<PARAGRAPH>
Profile
<PARAGRAPH>
Some of our online subscription plans enable you to "hide" your profile or otherwise make it inaccessible on our website.
Your profile will, however, remain accessible to persons who have access to your account or content.
<PARAGRAPH>
Team Members
<PARAGRAPH>
Some of our subscription plans enable you to grant account-level access rights to others.
Persons with such access ("Team Members") may be able to see and potentially alter your data.
You may revoke or downgrade Team Member access at any time.
<PARAGRAPH>
Videos
<PARAGRAPH>
We enable you to manage the privacy settings of your videos.
Your options, which depend on your subscription plan, may include:
---Public (or "anyone"): Your video will be publicly-available.
<PARAGRAPH>
---Just
you
(i.e., "only me")
: Your video will be available to you and authorized Team Members.
<PARAGRAPH>
---Selected people: Your video will be available to users you select (such as users you follow or specifically-designated users).
<PARAGRAPH>
---Password-protected: Your video may be accessed by anyone who enters the password you have set.
<PARAGRAPH>
---Private link:
Your video may be accessed by anyone who enters the link assigned to it.
<PARAGRAPH>
You may change these settings at any time.
Changes will be applied on a go-forward basis.
You should exercise caution in granting access to others.
Once you have granted access to someone else, you lose a degree of control over the distribution of your video as those persons may share the password and/or link with other people.
Regardless of your profile or video privacy settings, Vimeo reserves the right to inspect them for compliance with its Terms of Service, to provide customer support, or to address technical issues.
<PARAGRAPH>
Emails
<PARAGRAPH>
By creating an account, you consent to receive commercial emails from us.
This includes newsletters and offers.
Users from certain countries may have the ability to opt out or opt in at the time of account creation.
All users may decline to receive commercial messages in their account settings.
Please note that any opt-out request may take several days to process and you will continue to receive transactional emails from us (e.g., emails confirming transactions and/or providing information about your account).
<PARAGRAPH>
Mobile Device Communications
<PARAGRAPH>
We may, with your consent, send push notifications in our apps.
You may disable these by declining them or changing the app's settings.
To the extent provided, we may, with your consent, send SMS messages to your mobile telephone for authentication and security purposes.
You may opt out of receiving such messages at any time.
<PARAGRAPH>
We use physical, technical, and organizational security measures to safeguard your data from unauthorized or accidental disclosure.
Despite these efforts, no information system can be 100% secure, so we cannot guarantee the absolute security of your information.
<PARAGRAPH>
Users also have a role to play in keeping their data safe.
We encourage you to use a unique and hard-to-guess password for your account and to not share it with others.
You should only grant access rights to people who you know and trust, and, even then, you should be careful in granting all access rights.
You should monitor your account regularly.
If you believe that someone has gained access to your account without your permission, please contact us immediately so that we can investigate.
<PARAGRAPH>
You may receive other people's data in using our service.
If you receive information from other users, you must comply with all laws, including those concerning privacy, data security, and online marketing.
<PARAGRAPH>
We may provide links to online services that we do not own or operate.
These services fall outside of this Privacy Policy and we have no control over the data they collect.
For example, if you click on an advertisement, you may be taken to the advertiser's website.
Once on a third-party site, your data may be collected by others.
We encourage you to read the privacy policies of such services before using them.
<PARAGRAPH>
You may use our service through third-party sites.
For example, you may watch a video that is embedded on a third-party site or use one of our apps on a third-party platform.
This Privacy Policy covers our apps and video players, but does not cover any third-party site or any third-party video player.
<PARAGRAPH>

We enable exercise of these rights primarily through our services (which we reserve the right to modify).
For example, we allow users to change their information, download their videos, and close their accounts.
We also fulfil our obligations in response to direct requests.
We will endeavor to process requests within one month.
Please note that we may not be able to comply with requests to the extent that they would cause us to violate any law or infringe any other person's rights.
We reserve the right to request appropriate identification.
We will process requests free of charge unless they would impose an unreasonable cost on us.
<PARAGRAPH>
If you have a request, complaint or inquiry, please contact our Data Protection Officer at the address listed in Section 15.

Vimeo complies with the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework and Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework (collectively, "Privacy Shield") regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal information transferred from the EU to the U.S.
Vimeo adheres to the Privacy Shield principles of notice, choice, onward transfer, security, data integrity, access, and enforcement (the "Privacy Shield Principles").

By making this certification, Vimeo is subject to the investigatory and enforcement powers of the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC).
<PARAGRAPH>
Where Vimeo has transferred personal information of EU or Swiss residents to third parties, Vimeo shall be liable if those third parties do not process personal information in compliance with the Privacy Shield Principles.
This shall not be the case where Vimeo establishes that it is not responsible for the damage caused by the third party.
<PARAGRAPH>
In accordance with Privacy Shield Principles, Vimeo commits to resolve complaints about our collection or use of your personal information.
If you have inquiries or complaints regarding our Privacy Shield policy, you should first contact Vimeo at the address listed in Section 15.
If you do not receive timely acknowledgment of your complaint from us, or if we have not addressed your complaint to your satisfaction, please contact our independent recourse mechanism provider, JAMS, at https://www.jamsadr.com/eu-us-privacy-shield, to file a complaint.
JAMS' services are provided at no cost to you.
<PARAGRAPH>
If you have an unresolved complaint after contacting both Vimeo and JAMS, you may elect to arbitrate your Privacy Shield claims against Vimeo pursuant to Annex I of the Privacy Shield Principles, which provides for binding arbitration administered by the American Arbitration Association.
